Error: During prerendering, fetch() rejects when the prerender is complete. Typically these errors are handled by React but if you move fetch() to a different context by using `setTimeout`, `after`, or similar functions you may observe this error and you should handle it in that context. This occurred at route "/workout-safety/[country]/[state]/[city]".
