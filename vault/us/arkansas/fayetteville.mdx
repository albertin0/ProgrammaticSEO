Today? Get outside, but keep an eye on your route and maybe hold off on that really deep lung-busting effort.

<LungsJointsScore score={8} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air's a Bit Hazy:** The Air Quality Index is hanging at a "Moderate" 70 today, with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. It's not *bad*, but it's not crystal clear either, so if you've got sensitive lungs, consider scaling back.
*   **Construction Zone Ahead (and Sidewalks Too):** Multiple road and sidewalk closures are ongoing, particularly around Locust Avenue and East Huntsville Road. Watch your step and be prepared for detours if you're hitting the urban routes.
*   **Trails Might Be Tricky:** While the Razorback Greenway seems clear in Fayetteville, landslides have closed sections of East Fly Gap Road and CR 76 on the Ozark Highlands Trail. Plan your longer, more adventurous trail runs accordingly.

Look, I'm usually the first one to tell you to embrace whatever Mother Nature throws our way, but today in Fayetteville calls for a touch of caution and a lot of common sense. The weather is damn near perfect, hovering around 20.3 degrees Celsius (that's a glorious 68.5°F for us Fahrenheit folk) and clear skies all around. Seriously, this is prime running weather, the kind that makes you want to just keep going until you hit Oklahoma.

However, don't let that sunshine lull you into a false sense of security. While the pollen count is thankfully low today – rejoice, allergy sufferers! – the air quality isn't perfect. We're sitting at an AQI of 70, which is "Moderate." It's not going to kill you, but it's enough fine particulate matter floating around that if you're prone to respiratory issues, you might feel it. This isn't the day to try and set a new 5k PR if you're typically huffing and puffing more than usual.

My biggest beef for today, and honestly, most days around here, is the ongoing dance with construction. If you're planning on using any routes that crisscross the city, be warned. Locust Avenue, for instance, is completely closed down through tomorrow, so that's a definite reroute if it's on your usual loop. Then you've got Dead Horse Mountain Road with a temporary lane closure during the day, and East Huntsville Road has a sidewalk closure that's dragging on. It's not just about cars; these closures can push pedestrians and cyclists into less safe areas, so eyes up, headphones down a notch, and stay alert.

If you're heading out for a longer trek on the dirt, be aware of regional trail conditions. While Lake Fayetteville Trail is likely fine, keep in mind that the Ozark Highlands Trail has reported closures due to landslides on sections like East Fly Gap Road and CR 76. That's not right in our backyard, but if you're driving out for a serious trail day, double-check those specific access points. You don't want to drive an hour just to find a "Trail Closed" sign.

**Pro Tip for Tomorrow:** While today's pollen is low, forecasts suggest pollen levels will be rising, especially with these increasing temperatures. If you're an allergy sufferer, prepare for a tougher Friday and weekend outdoors.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch for Unmarked Detours:** With various road and sidewalk closures, you might find yourself unexpectedly sharing space with traffic. Assume drivers don't see you. Wear bright colors, make eye contact, and consider reflective gear if you're out near dusk.

So, lace up, Fayetteville. Enjoy the glorious weather, but stay sharp out there. No heroics, just smart running.
