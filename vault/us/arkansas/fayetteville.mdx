Alright Fayetteville, it's a decent enough day to get those miles in, but don't expect a perfectly smooth ride.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering in that "meh" zone, so don't be surprised if your lungs feel a little more taxed than usual, especially if you're sensitive.
*   Construction is *everywhere*, from sidewalk closures near E Huntsville Rd to major roadway overhauls on MLK Boulevard, meaning your usual routes might be a frustrating game of "detour roulette."
*   On the bright side, the weather is clear and a pleasant 11.8°C (around 53°F), so at least you won't be battling the elements.
</BulletList>

Look, the skies are clear, the temperature is mild, and honestly, those are prime conditions for getting outside and moving. However, if you're planning a long run or ride on some of the major thoroughfares, you're going to contend with the city's seemingly endless appetite for road work. We've got temporary sidewalk closures on E Huntsville Road and Wilson Avenue, and full-blown construction on Locust and Ashwood Avenues that's still causing headaches.

The real kicker for anyone trying to navigate on foot or bike is the ongoing infrastructure projects. The MLK Boulevard Interchange project, for example, is making permanent traffic pattern changes on South Futrall Drive, which can definitely throw a wrench into your flow if you're in that area. Same goes for the Highway 112 widening project – a necessary evil, sure, but a hazard nonetheless if you're trying to share the road. Even the Highway 71B corridor plan is causing improvements (read: disruptions) to North College Avenue. This kind of scattered, pervasive construction means even popular routes like sections of the Razorback Greenway might have detours or increased vehicle traffic nearby, so stay alert.

If you're heading further afield, be aware that portions of the Ozark Highlands Trail, specifically East Fly Gap Road and CR 76/White Rock Mtn Road, are closed due to landslides. Always check official trail sites before you head out for a wilderness adventure.

### Environmental Breakdown:

| Pollutant Category | Level             |
| :----------------- | :---------------- |
| Pollen             | Low               |
| AQI                | Moderate (69)     |
| Dominant Pollutant | Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Chaos Ahead:** Expect localized road and sidewalk closures across the city, especially around E Huntsville Rd, Wilson Ave, Locust Ave, Ashwood Ave, and the major arterial roads like MLK Blvd, Highway 112, and Highway 71B. Plan your routes carefully and be prepared for detours.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Moderate AQI:** While an AQI of 69 isn't terrible, it's due to fine particulate matter. If you have respiratory sensitivities or are planning prolonged, high-intensity outdoor exercise, consider scaling back or opting for an indoor workout today. Your lungs will thank you.
