Alright, Little Rock, let's talk about hitting the pavement today. Honestly? It's a mixed bag, so don't be a hero.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That 11.2°C (52°F) is pretty much perfect for getting outside and not ending up a sweaty mess or an icicle. Your joints will thank you.
*   Pollen count is finally playing nice, so your nose and throat get a break from the usual spring assault.
*   But hold your horses on that fresh air fantasy – our AQI is pushing into the "Moderate" zone thanks to fine particulate matter. Your lungs might have something to say about that long run.
*   Oh, and it's Little Rock Marathon weekend, which means parts of the city are probably going to be a traffic cone obstacle course. Don't plan on cruising the Arkansas River Trail without checking for diversions.

## The Daily Rundown

Look, the weather gods finally threw us a bone with these temps. Clear skies, cool air – ideal conditions for almost anything. No excuses there. And if you usually sound like a congested trumpet during spring, you're in luck; the pollen is low today, so breathe easy on that front.

| Pollen Level | Dominant Pollutant             | AQI Score |
| :----------- | :----------------------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) | 70        |

### Watch Your Breath, Runners

Here's the kicker: that Air Quality Index of 70 is "Moderate." That means fine particulate matter is floating around. If you've got any kind of lung issues – asthma, COPD, or just a general disdain for wheezing – you might feel this. It's not "stay indoors and seal the windows" bad, but it's not "take the deepest breath of your life" good either. Those of us pushing hard are probably sucking in more of that junk than we'd like.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate AQI: Lungs on Alert
An AQI of 70, with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, means sensitive groups *will* feel it. Even if you're not typically sensitive, prolonged exertion in these conditions isn't ideal for your respiratory system. Maybe dial back the intensity or shorten your route, especially if you're out near heavy traffic.

### Marathon Mayhem Ahead (Literally)

It's Friday, February 28, and while the main event of the 2026 Little Rock Marathon is likely tomorrow, March 1st, that doesn't mean today is free and clear. Event setup and early closures can mess with your usual routes. The THV11 forecast even mentioned road closures "happening during the 2026 Little Rock Marathon" alongside today's date.

If your go-to is anywhere near downtown, the Clinton Presidential Park Bridge, or sections of the Arkansas River Trail that loop through the city, expect some detours. Better to check the official marathon route maps and city advisories before you head out, or you'll be doing an impromptu urban orienteering challenge.

### Little Rock Marathon: Plan Your Route!
The 2026 Little Rock Marathon is this weekend. Expect potential road closures and heavy traffic near the race course, especially around the downtown area and the Arkansas River Trail. Check official marathon and city websites for specific closure times and maps to avoid frustration (or getting run over by a rogue porta-potty delivery truck).

### Wildfire Worries Lingering

And just a friendly reminder from your local NWS office, we're still sitting under a "high to moderate wildfire danger" across Arkansas, with burn bans in effect in several counties. While there aren't any active, major fires belching smoke over Little Rock today to mess with our AQI from that perspective, the general dry conditions mean things can go sideways fast. Stay aware of your surroundings, especially if you're venturing into more wooded areas or near the edges of town. Don't add to the problem, people.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Regional Wildfire Risk
Despite today's clear skies, the region is experiencing elevated wildfire danger. Avoid any outdoor burning whatsoever. If you see smoke, especially unmanaged fires, report it immediately. No one wants to breathe that in, and no one wants to lose their house.
</AlertBox>

So, enjoy the sweet temps and the lack of pollen, but be smart about that moderate air quality and *definitely* double-check your running route for marathon-related shenanigans.

*Data grounded with THV11 and NWS Little Rock from February 28, 2026.*
