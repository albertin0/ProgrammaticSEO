Alright Little Rock, if you absolutely have to get outside today, it's a decent window, but don't expect perfectly crisp air.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
-   The temperature is looking fantastic for a late February run, pushing 20 degrees Celsius with clear skies, so shed those layers. It even feels warmer, closer to 24°C.
-   Pollen count is blessedly low, meaning your sinuses should get a break.
-   However, our air quality is sitting at a "Moderate" AQI of 66, primarily due to fine particulate matter, so anyone with sensitive lungs might notice it.
</BulletList>

Look, the weather is playing nice for once. You've got that spring-like warmth without the oppressive humidity or the pollen apocalypse that's usually just around the corner. If you're planning on hitting the pavement or trails, today’s your last relatively unobstructed shot before downtown turns into a logistical nightmare.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Heads Up: Little Rock Marathon This Weekend!
Forget running anywhere near downtown this Saturday, February 28th, from 5:00 AM to 10:00 AM, or Sunday, March 1st, from 3:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The 24th annual Little Rock Marathon is taking over, meaning major road closures and zero parking on the course. Plan your long runs and bike rides accordingly, or better yet, go cheer on the poor souls who paid to run 26.2 miles.
</AlertBox>

Now, about that air. While the overall AQI is "moderate," the fine particulate matter is the main offender. This stuff isn't just annoying; it can dig deep into your lungs and cause issues, especially if you’ve got asthma or other respiratory conditions. You probably won't drop dead, but you might feel a bit more gunk in your lungs than usual after a tough workout.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### AQI Alert: Watch Your Breath
With a "Moderate" AQI of 66 driven by fine particulate matter, sensitive individuals should probably dial back the intensity or stick to an indoor track. For the rest of us, just be aware of how you're feeling and don't push it if you start coughing.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of trails, the Arkansas River Trail is always a local favorite, and thankfully, the North Little Rock side is reported to have all trails open. But if you're on the Little Rock side, especially near Cantrell Road, remember that notorious "gap" where you're basically forced into fast-moving traffic. The city's been talking about "closing the loop" on that for years, and updates from February 10th, 2026, suggest they're moving forward with design grants. Until then, keep your head on a swivel and don't assume drivers see you.

No major wildfire smoke to worry about right now, which is a small victory for our lungs. Also, any flood warnings from earlier in the week for areas like Patterson have expired. So, mostly clear sailing, literally and figuratively, if you avoid downtown this weekend.
