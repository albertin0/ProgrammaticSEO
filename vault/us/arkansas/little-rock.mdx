Alright, Little Rock. Today's one of those days that *looks* good on paper, but you gotta pay attention to the fine print before you hit the pavement or the dirt.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
-   That 14-degree Celsius temperature? Absolutely mint running weather. Pair it with low pollen, and your allergies can finally chill.
-   Don't let the clear skies fool you: our Air Quality Index is hovering at a "Moderate" 62, mostly thanks to fine particulate matter. Your lungs might notice it, especially if you're pushing hard.
-   While the paved sections of the Arkansas River Trail are likely fine, any unpaved trails, especially those shadier spots, might still be a muddy mess thanks to those on-again, off-again sprinkles and the freeze/thaw cycles we've had. Don't be "that guy" tearing up the singletrack.
</BulletList>

### Little Rock's Air Quality Today

The raw numbers:

| Pollutant             | AQI | Air Quality |
| :-------------------- | :-- | :---------- |
| Fine Particulate (PM2.5) | 62  | Moderate    |
| Ozone (O3)            | 41  | Fair        |

Your lungs are probably more concerned with the PM2.5 today. An AQI of 62 means it's acceptable for most, but if you're sensitive, or if you're planning on really pushing the pace up to the Big Dam Bridge, you might feel some irritation. AccuWeather's even predicting "Poor" air for sensitive groups today, which tells you to take that moderate rating seriously.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads up for the Respiratory Crowd:** If you've got asthma, COPD, or just a generally whiny respiratory system, that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) isn't your friend. Take it easy, maybe dial back the intensity, or hit the treadmill at a gym. You don't get medals for hacking up a lung on the River Trail.

### Trail Conditions & Wildfire Risk

While the City of North Little Rock proudly states "All trails are now open" on their site for their multi-use paths, a couple of wet days and fluctuating temperatures means those natural surface trails could still be soft. You know the drill: if you're leaving a rut, turn around. Preserve the trails for everyone, including yourself tomorrow.

And listen, even with some rain, the National Weather Service still issued an "Elevated Wildfire Danger" advisory for Tuesday, citing winds and dry air. While today is Thursday, the NWS also mentioned yesterday that "Wildfire danger is high to moderate across all of Arkansas at this time". So if you're out on the trails that butt up against drier brush, keep your eyes peeled. Don't be flicking anything that could spark a problem.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Unpaved Trail Treachery:** Watch your footing, especially on any natural surface trails around Two Rivers Park or Burns Park. Recent weather shifts mean hidden muddy sections are a real possibility. Don't be the person who ruins the trail for everyone else.

**Hydration, People:** Even at a comfortable 14°C, you're still sweating. Grab your water bottle. It's not rocket science; it's basic human physiology.
