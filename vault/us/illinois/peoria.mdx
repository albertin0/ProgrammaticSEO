Alright, Peoria. If you're heading out today, Friday, February 28, 2026, it's a "bundle up and be aware" kind of day, not an "effortless PR" kind of day.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** We're sitting at an AQI of 71 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. That's "Moderate," which means it's fine for most, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you might notice it, especially pushing hard. Not worth a lung sacrifice for a few extra miles.
*   **Still Chilly Out There:** With temperatures around 4°C (39°F) and a "feels like" closer to freezing, your joints are going to feel every bit of that cold. Layers, people. This isn't groundbreaking news, but it's important.
*   **Winter Closures Persist:** Some of your favorite hilly routes in **Laura Bradley Park** are still shut down for the season. Don't go expecting to hit those inclines without checking for signs, because those roads won't reopen until spring.

### The Full Rundown

Today's a classic late-winter Peoria day: a bit of a tease with clear skies, but a bite in the air that reminds you spring hasn't *quite* arrived yet. While the sun might peek through the "mostly cloudy" forecast, don't let it fool you into underdressing. That 4°C is going to feel colder with any breeze, so think multiple thin layers that you can shed or add. Nobody wants to pull a hamstring because they thought a long-sleeve tee was enough.

**Lungs:** Good news for allergy sufferers, pollen is low. So that's one less thing trying to take you down. But that AQI of 71, with ozone leading the charge? That's your body working harder to process air that isn't exactly pristine. Take it easy on the sprints, especially if you're prone to any respiratory irritation. If you're already sniffly, maybe stick to an indoor track today.

**Joints:** The cold is the main adversary for your joints right now. A proper warm-up isn't just a suggestion; it's mandatory. Dynamic stretches, light cardio to get the blood flowing, everything you skipped in your younger, more invincible years. Because if you launch straight into a hard effort, your knees and hips are going to complain louder than a politician on Grandview Drive. And speaking of roads, remember those seasonal closures in Laura Bradley Park. You might have to adjust your usual hill repeats for a few more weeks.

### Construction Corner

It's Peoria, so of course there's construction. The Maxwell Road and Middle Road project restarted earlier this month, so expect lane reductions and traffic shifts in that area. While it might not directly block your favorite running path, it means more cars, more exhaust, and potentially more dust in certain areas, further aggravating that moderate AQI. Same goes for the ongoing Sheridan Road and Glen Avenue culvert replacement. If your route takes you near these spots, be aware and consider alternative paths to avoid unnecessary fumes and potential detours.

It's not a perfect day, but it's far from a write-off. Just run smart, dress appropriately, and don't assume every path is open. Spring is coming, but winter still holds some cards.
