Today in Peoria, it's a "bundle up and watch your step" kind of day, thanks to some lingering chill and enough road construction to make navigating your run an Olympic sport.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** AQI is clocking in at 74 due to ozone. Not terrible, but enough to make your lungs notice if you're pushing serious mileage.
*   **Bracing for Brrr:** While clear, the temperature is hanging right around freezing (0.2°C / 32°F). Make sure those hammies are warm before you start hammering.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Seriously, it feels like every major artery in Peoria is a construction zone. Plan your route or risk adding unplanned detours and dodging cones to your workout.
</BulletList>

Look, the skies are clear, which is a win for February, but don't let that fool you. The air quality isn't exactly pristine with that AQI of 74, mainly due to ozone. If you're susceptible to respiratory issues, maybe dial back the intensity a notch, especially during peak traffic times when that ozone gets a boost. Your lungs will thank you.

And speaking of dialing it back, it's still cold out there, hovering just above freezing. That's a prime temperature for pulling something if you skip a proper warm-up. Get those dynamic stretches in. Don't be that person limping around the office tomorrow because you thought a brisk walk to the mailbox counted as prep.

The biggest headache, as usual, is the sheer amount of orange barrel action across the city. If your usual route involves anything near Maxwell Road or Middle Road, expect delays and detours. Construction on those has been restarting/ongoing since early February, with lane reductions and traffic shifts. And don't even think about Harmon Highway (Illinois 116) if you run out that way – the bridge over Kickapoo Creek is totally closed for replacement until the end of the year. You're not going to "run the planets" on the Riverfront Trail today, because it's not April 18th, but even that area along Water Street can get tricky with other IDOT projects.

This means if you're heading for a solid long run on the **Rock Island Greenway Trail**, getting there might be half the battle. Be aware of traffic shifts and increased vehicle congestion on connecting roads. Once you're on the trail itself, you should be golden, but exercise caution around any road crossings.

### Moderate AQI for Ozone
With an AQI of 74, ozone is the dominant pollutant. Those with sensitive respiratory systems might experience some discomfort during strenuous outdoor activity. Consider running earlier in the morning or later in the evening when ozone levels tend to be lower, or just keep your pace moderate.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Persistent Road Construction Hazards
Major construction projects are active on several key roads, including Maxwell Road, Middle Road, Glen Avenue, and a complete closure on Harmon Highway (IL 116). Expect significant detours, reduced lanes, and increased traffic. Plan your drive to trailheads carefully and be extra vigilant if running near active construction zones.
