Alright Peoria, let's get real. Today's not terrible for a run, but don't get cocky.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **The Air's a Bit Thick:** AQI is clocking in at 52, which is "Moderate." Nothing to totally panic about, but with inhalable particulate matter floating around, if your lungs are easily annoyed, maybe dial back the intensity on those longer efforts today.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Seriously, do these road projects ever end? You’ll want to watch out, especially if your route takes you anywhere near Maxwell Road and Middle Road. Construction restarted there on February 2, 2026, and they’ve got lane reductions and traffic shifts in full swing until June.
*   **Evening Freeze Risk:** While it's a decent 6.9°C (around 44-46°F) and clear right now, temperatures are dropping to about 29°F (around -1.6°C) tonight. Light snow is expected to spread across central Illinois later, which means any moisture on the roads *will* freeze and create slick spots. Don't be that person wiping out on a patch of black ice.

### Mind the Maxwell Road Mayhem

If your route usually involves Middle Road, especially between Maxwell Road and Dirksen Parkway, be aware it's down to one eastbound lane. Maxwell Road itself, between Fauber Road and Middle Road, is still two-way but expect traffic shifts around the intersection. Those large construction vehicles don't care about your Strava segment.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Black Ice is a Sneaky Bastard Tonight

Seriously, if you're heading out after sunset or early tomorrow morning, *assume* the pavement is slick in spots, especially on less-trafficked roads or shaded areas. A little light snow, followed by a freeze, is the perfect recipe for a nasty fall. Don't mess with it – save the speed work for another day. Or, you know, use a treadmill. Nobody likes a broken hip this time of year.

### Your Lungs Aren't Industrial Filters

With the AQI hitting "Moderate" due to particulate matter, think about your breathing. If you're prone to asthma or have any respiratory issues, consider keeping your workout indoors, or at least sticking to lower-intensity activities outside. This isn't the day to push for a PR on the Rock Island Greenway if you're already feeling congested.
