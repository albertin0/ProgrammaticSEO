Alright, Aurora. Today’s a mixed bag, so if you're heading out, don't be a hero. Be smart.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** We're sitting at a "Moderate" AQI, thanks mostly to inhalable particulate matter. That means you'll want to take it easy if your lungs aren't 100%.
*   **Chilly with a Bite:** It's clear out, which is nice, but temperatures are hovering around 4°C (39°F). Factor in a wind chill that can make it feel like 17°F (-8°C), and you'll be regretting that short-sleeve choice.
*   **Trail Treachery:** While most trails are fine, there's utility work happening on sections of the Fox River Trail West. Expect some temporary gravel patches. Don't go wiping out because you weren't paying attention.
</BulletList>

## Today's Workout Wisdom

Look, it's not the worst day to get moving, but it's definitely not ideal. That "Moderate" AQI is enough to irritate anyone with even minor respiratory issues. "Unhealthy for sensitive groups" isn't a badge of honor for our air, so if you're prone to coughing or wheezing, maybe stick to that treadmill in the basement today.

As for the chill, 4°C (39°F) might not sound brutal, but with the wind, it'll cut right through you. Layer up properly, folks. We're still firmly in late winter, and hypothermia isn't a fun souvenir from your run.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Air
The Air Quality Index is currently 65, flagged as "Moderate." The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (PM10). If you have asthma, COPD, or any other respiratory conditions, consider reducing the intensity or duration of your outdoor workout. Listen to your body, not that PR chasing voice in your head.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of trails, the Fox Valley Park District crews are out there doing necessary utility work on the **Fox River Trail West**. They've got some sections temporarily reverted to gravel. This isn't just an annoyance for your cadence; it's a legitimate trip hazard, especially if you're biking fast or not watching your footing. Walk your bike through those sections and keep an eye out for changing conditions. They'll get the asphalt back down eventually, but not today.

And while it won't impact your *today* workout, the city is still in the engineering study phase for the New York Street Bridge repair, with actual construction tentatively scheduled for later in 2026. Keep an eye on that for future trail reroutes or traffic headaches if you run or bike through downtown.

### Dress for Success (and Survival)
With temperatures around freezing and a significant wind chill, dressing in layers is critical. Think moisture-wicking base, insulating middle, and a wind/water-resistant outer layer. Don't forget gloves, a hat, and warm socks. Frostbite is a real thing, even on a "clear" day.
</AlertBox>

No major weather alerts or events blocking trails right now, so if you're properly equipped and your lungs can handle the particulates, go for it. Just be aware of the conditions. And for the love of all that is holy, hydrate. Cold weather can sneak up on you too.
