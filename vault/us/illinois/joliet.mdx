Listen up, Joliet. Today is one of those days where "clear skies" is a total bait-and-switch.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Your Lungs Aren't Loving This Air:** Despite the clear sky, the Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 77, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) leading the charge. Some reports are even calling it "Poor" and unhealthy for sensitive groups. Cold air already irritates your airways, but add these particles to the mix, and you're basically giving your lungs a tough workout before you even start moving.
*   **It's Still Frigid, Don't Be a Hero:** At -2.1°C, we're well below freezing. That crisp air feels nice for about five minutes until your exposed skin starts complaining. You'll need layers, folks, and more than you think.
*   **Trail Blockages Abound:** Forget your usual routes if they include the Rock Run Greenway Trail or a significant chunk of the Joliet Junction Trail. More on that below.
</BulletList>

## Cold Air, Particulate Matter, and Your Respiratory System

So, you look outside, see a clear day, and think, "Great, finally a break from the gloom!" Not so fast. While the pollen is blessedly low, the air quality isn't doing your lungs any favors. With an AQI of 77 and inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, you're breathing in microscopic crud that can irritate your respiratory system. When you combine that with freezing temperatures, your airways constrict, making them more susceptible to irritation and inflammation. This isn't just for your asthmatic buddies; anyone pushing hard outside is going to feel it.

## Trail Time? Think Again for Some Spots

If your go-to is the **Rock Run Greenway Trail** between Black Road and Essington Avenue, tough luck. That section, including both the Black Road and Paul V. Nichols Access areas, is closed today, February 26th, for a prescribed burn by the Forest Preserve District of Will County. So, unless you enjoy running through smoke and embers, find another spot.

And don't even think about a full run on the **Joliet Junction Trail**. A significant section, from McDonough Street in Joliet to Moen Avenue in Rockdale, is closed until March 21st due to an Illinois Department of Transportation project on I-80. Check the Forest Preserve District's website for updates before you head out, or you'll be turning around frustrated.

### Lungs Under Stress: Cold Air & Moderate AQI
The combination of sub-freezing temperatures and moderate (or even "poor" per some sources) air quality due to particulate matter is a recipe for respiratory distress. If you have any underlying lung conditions, consider taking your workout indoors or significantly reducing your intensity and duration today. Everyone else, slow your roll and pay attention to how your lungs feel.

## Gear Up, Buttercup, It's Winter

Clear skies don't mean warm. It's still cold enough for frostbite if you're not careful. Think layers, moisture-wicking materials against your skin, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and something to cover your face to protect your airways from the cold, particulate-laden air.

### Mind Your Steps: Black Ice Can Be Sneaky
While it's "clear" now, overnight temperatures are still dropping below freezing, and any melted snow or moisture from yesterday could have refrozen. Be extra vigilant on shaded paths, bridges, and underpasses where black ice loves to hide. A sudden fall on cold concrete is a quick trip to my PT clinic, and trust me, you don't want that.

### Stay Hydrated (Yes, Even When It's Cold)
You still sweat in cold weather, and the dry air can dehydrate you faster than you realize. Keep sipping water or an electrolyte drink, even if you don't feel as thirsty as you would in July. Your joints and muscles will thank you.
