Alright Joliet, if you're looking to pound the pavement today, you better read this first. It's not the worst day, but it's certainly not perfect.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lung Buster Warning:** That "clear" sky isn't telling the whole story. The AQI is sitting at 69, and the dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter. This isn't just a number; it's tiny crap getting into your lungs. Plus, with a prescribed burn shutting down parts of the **Rock Run Greenway Trail** today, you can bet some of that smoke is contributing to the funk in the air. Your lungs will feel it, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   **Trail Blocked:** Speaking of the Rock Run Greenway, forget about your usual loop. The stretch from Black Road to Essington Avenue is *closed* for a prescribed burn. So, if that's your go-to, find a new route or hit the treadmill. Don't be "that person" ignoring closure signs – it's for everyone's safety (and to keep you out of the smoke).
*   **Chilly, Not Crippling:** The temperature is hovering around 3.9°C (about 39°F), and it's clear, which is a definite upgrade from the deep freeze. It's chilly, especially with a RealFeel of 29°F in the morning, but completely manageable with layers. No extreme cold alerts, no crazy winds to blow you into the Des Plaines River, and no fresh snow or ice to contend with. Just don't forget the gloves and a hat, because numb fingers are a real buzzkill.

## Today's Breakdown:

### Air Quality & Pollen

It's a low pollen day, which is great for those of you sneezing your way through spring. However, the air quality isn't doing you any favors. That AQI of 69 means it's moderate, and the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the culprit. Think about it: tiny airborne particles from that prescribed burn near Rock Run, mixed with general urban crud. It's not *dangerous* for most, but it's not exactly crisp mountain air either. If you have respiratory sensitivities, consider an indoor workout or keeping your outdoor intensity low.

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- |
| Low          | 69  | Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Air Quality Alert: Moderate AQI & Prescribed Burn Smoke.** With a moderate AQI due to fine particulate matter and a prescribed burn happening at Rock Run Greenway Trail, individuals with respiratory issues should proceed with caution. It’s not a day for setting PRs if clean air is a priority.
</AlertBox>

### Weather & Ground Conditions

The good news is it's clear and not dumping snow or rain. Temperature is a respectable 3.9°C (39°F), warming up a bit during the day. This means no slippery ice to snap an ankle, and most surfaces should be dry. Just be mindful that in shaded areas or on less-trafficked paths, there might still be some lingering dampness or even a thin layer of frost from overnight temps. The ground is unlikely to be fully frozen solid, so watch for soft spots, especially if you're on unpaved trails.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Trail Closure: Rock Run Greenway Trail (Black Road to Essington Ave) is CLOSED.** Do not attempt to use this section of the trail today due to a prescribed burn. This includes the Black Road Access and Paul V. Nichols Access points. Find an alternative route or preserve. Ignoring closures is unsafe and can interfere with official operations.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Joliet!** Even with "clear" conditions, 39°F (3.9°C) is cold enough to warrant proper layers. Think base, mid, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't skimp on gloves, a hat, or ear covers, especially if you're out before the sun really gets going. Your joints will thank you for keeping them warm, too.
