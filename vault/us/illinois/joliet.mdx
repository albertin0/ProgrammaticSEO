It's a "bundle up and be smart" kind of day in Joliet, folks.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  - That AQI is sitting at 75 with inhalable particulate matter dominating the air, which means you might feel it in your lungs, especially if you're pushing hard.
  - Temperatures are hovering around 3.8°C (about 39°F) and it's clear out, but that chill can still bite if you're not dressed right.
  - Major sections of your favorite trails are still impacted by ongoing construction or recent activity, so don't just blindly head out.
</BulletList>

Look, the sun might be out, but today isn't a day for forgetting your gear or your common sense. The air quality in Joliet is teetering on "meh" with an AQI of 75, primarily thanks to inhalable particulate matter. For most of us, that's just a mild annoyance, maybe a bit of a cough if you're doing hill repeats up McDonough Street. But if you've got any kind of respiratory issues, or if you're really planning on hammering out some miles, you'll want to be mindful. Those tiny particles aren't doing your lungs any favors, so maybe scale back the intensity a notch or consider an indoor alternative if you're sensitive.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Moderate Air Quality Alert:** With an AQI of 75 and inhalable particulate matter, take it easy on those heavy breathing efforts. Your lungs will thank you.

Temperature-wise, we're at a brisk 3.8°C (39°F) and clear. That's prime layering weather, not shorts-and-a-t-shirt weather. Don't be that person shivering five minutes into their run down the Rock Run Greenway Trail, wondering why their fingers are numb. Gloves, a hat, and a couple of breathable layers are your friends. Remember, if you start warm, you're doing it wrong.

Now, for the big one: trail access. You know I love a good long run on the Joliet Junction Trail, but a significant chunk of it is still a no-go. The section from McDonough Street in Joliet all the way to Moen Avenue in Rockdale remains closed due to that seemingly never-ending IDOT project on I-80. This closure started way back in January and is scheduled to last until March 21. So, if your usual loop involves that stretch, you need to find an alternate route. Don't try to sneak around the barriers; it's closed for a reason, and nobody wants to trip over construction debris or get in the way of heavy machinery.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Joliet Junction Trail Closure:** The section from McDonough Street to Moen Avenue is CLOSED until March 21, 2026, due to I-80 construction. Find another route!

Speaking of trails, the Rock Run Greenway Trail between Black Road and Essington Avenue saw a prescribed burn just a couple of days ago, on Thursday, February 26th. While the Forest Preserve District of Will County stated that access areas would reopen, always double-check the ground conditions. Ash, uneven surfaces, or lingering smoke (which could contribute to our current particulate matter levels) are all possibilities, especially if the winds haven't thoroughly cleared everything out.

  **Rock Run Greenway Trail Tip:** A prescribed burn occurred recently (Feb 26). While re-opened, be mindful of lingering ash, uneven terrain, or residual particulate matter, especially if you have respiratory sensitivities.

So, yeah, you can get out there, but make it a calculated move. Dress warm, watch your effort given the air quality, and for Pete's sake, respect those trail closures. Nobody needs a side of construction detour with their long run.
