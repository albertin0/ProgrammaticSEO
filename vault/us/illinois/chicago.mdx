Don't even think about hitting the Lakefront Trail like it's a normal day; this city's trying its best to trip you up.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
  <li>That Lakefront Trail closure near Oak Street and Ohio Street? It's not a suggestion, it's an alert due to "weather conditions," and the Chicago Avenue underpass is also a no-go. Find another route.</li>
  <li>Don't let the "clear" conditions fool you; the temperature is dancing around freezing (1.2°C, feels like -2°C), and meteorologists are warning about potential "flash freezes" and dangerously slippery spots, especially on bridges and overpasses. Plus, light snow is expected tonight.</li>
  <li>The air quality is moderate with ozone as the dominant pollutant, so if your lungs usually complain, consider an indoor alternative or dial back the intensity.</li>

### Mind the Ice, You Tourists and Locals Alike
Look, Chicago weather in late February is a fickle beast. Even if it's "clear" right now, temperatures are hovering just above freezing, but the *feels like* temperature is below it. What does that mean for your precious joints? Black ice, probably, lurking in shaded areas, underpasses, and especially on bridges. We've seen "flash freeze" events turn perfectly normal sidewalks into skating rinks in a matter of minutes. Adding to that, the National Weather Service is calling for snow in Cook County *tonight*, specifically warning about "slippery travel, especially on bridges and overpasses." Your morning run might be clear, but your evening jaunt could be a broken ankle waiting to happen. Be smart, slow down, and assume every dark patch of pavement is a hidden hazard.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Lakefront Trail Is CLOSED. Seriously.
For those of you who consider the Lakefront Trail your personal treadmill, a significant chunk is currently shut down. The Chicago Park District has issued an alert that the trail is closed from Oak Street to Ohio Street, and the Chicago Avenue underpass is also inaccessible, all due to "weather conditions." This isn't just a minor inconvenience; it's a major artery for runners and cyclists. Trying to sneak through is asking for trouble, whether it's unstable surfaces or a run-in with patrol. Find an alternate route. Divert to city streets (and watch for traffic, obviously) or hit the gym.

### Your Lungs Aren't Getting a Gold Star
While the pollen count is mercifully low today, the air quality is still sitting at a "moderate" 70 AQI, with ozone taking center stage. If you're sensitive to ozone, or just generally prefer to breathe actual clean air, this isn't the day to push high-intensity intervals. Keep an eye on how you feel, and don't be a hero. There's always tomorrow, or a treadmill indoors where the air isn't trying to make you cough.
