It's one of those "get it done if you gotta, but manage your expectations" kind of days out there in Chicago.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is sitting at a middling 71 AQI with fine particulate matter making up the bulk of it. Not terrible, but definitely not pristine for those deep breaths.
*   It's chilly at 0.8°C (around 33°F), so bundle up appropriately, especially if you're hitting early morning or late evening miles. Clear skies are a win, though.
*   Mind your route: parts of the Lakefront Trail were closed as recently as a few days ago, and there are significant road closures today for the Rev. Jesse Jackson funeral procession on the South Side.

## Current Conditions & What to Watch For

Today, February 26, 2026, Chicago sees mostly clear conditions with temperatures hovering just above freezing. Winds are a mild 5-10 mph from the south, with occasional gusts around 20 mph. The low pollen count (thanks, winter!) means allergy sufferers can breathe a little easier, but the moderate AQI is a persistent buzzkill for optimal lung function.

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant       | Temperature | Condition |
| :----------- | :---- | :----------------------- | :---------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 71    | Fine particulate matter  | 0.8°C (33°F)| Clear     |

### Air Quality: Don't Discount "Moderate"

That AQI of 71, with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) as the main culprit, means the air isn't exactly doing you favors. It's not a "stay indoors" day for everyone, but if you've got sensitive lungs, asthma, or any other respiratory issues, you might feel it. The Chicago area has seen a general worsening of air quality in recent years, and while today isn't a wildfire-smoke emergency like we've seen in the past, it's a reminder to pay attention.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory:** While 71 is "moderate," consistent exposure to fine particulate matter can still impact respiratory health. If you feel any irritation, dial back your intensity or consider an indoor session.

### Local Obstacles: Trail Closures & Procession Routes

If your usual loop involves the Lakefront Trail, know that there was an alert as recently as February 23rd for closures between Oak Street and Ohio Street, including the Chicago Avenue underpass, due to weather conditions. Always double-check the Chicago Park District website before heading out, especially after any winter weather. These things don't always get cleared immediately.

A much more immediate and impactful hazard for today is the Rev. Jesse Jackson funeral procession. Road closures are in effect on Drexel Boulevard between Hyde Park Boulevard and 49th Street, and on 50th Street between Drexel and Ellis avenues, until 11:15 p.m. tonight. These are serious closures and will affect foot traffic and vehicle access around the Rainbow PUSH Headquarters (930 E. 50th St.). Do not try to run through or around these areas; respect the closures and the event.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**South Side Road Closures:** Avoid running or biking routes near Drexel Boulevard (Hyde Park Blvd. to 49th St.) and 50th Street (Drexel to Ellis Ave.) today due to the Rev. Jesse Jackson funeral procession. These closures are active until 11:15 p.m. Find an alternate route or move your workout.

### Looking Ahead: Wind & Fire Risk Tomorrow

While today's winds are manageable, Friday is looking to bring stronger southwest winds with gusts up to 35 mph. Coupled with a rapid warm-up and dry conditions, this creates an elevated risk for grass and brush fires. Keep an eye on the forecast for tomorrow, especially if your routes involve unpaved paths or open areas.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Plan Ahead for Friday's Winds:** Stronger winds and potential fire risk are on the horizon for tomorrow. Consider your route and attire if you're planning an outdoor workout on Friday, February 27th.

Overall, today is doable if you're mindful. Stay safe, Chicago.
