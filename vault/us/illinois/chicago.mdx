Alright, Chicago. Today's a classic late-winter paradox: looks decent, but has a few hidden teeth.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That Lakefront Trail stretch is still shut down due to weather-related damage, so plan your run accordingly.
*   The air quality is... well, it's Chicago. Moderate, but with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, it's still something to be mindful of, especially for sensitive lungs.
*   It's hovering right around freezing, meaning any damp spots are black ice traps, particularly on bridges and underpasses. The NWS is even calling for light snow late this evening, so don't get caught off guard.

## The Rundown

It's February 26th, and while we might be catching glimpses of the sun, don't let that fool you into thinking it's prime running weather without precautions. That crisp 0.8°C (around 33°F) air means you need to layer up properly, or you'll be regretting it halfway through your mileage. Forget the flimsy long sleeve; think wind-resistant outer shell and gloves. Your fingers and toes will thank me.

The big head-scratcher for anyone planning to hit the lakefront is the ongoing closure of the Lakefront Trail from Oak Street to Ohio Street. This isn't just a suggestion; it's a full-on "stay out" situation due to weather conditions that have made it unsafe. This alert has been in place since February 23rd, and frankly, ignoring it is just asking for a trip to the ER. Find an alternate route, seriously. Lincoln Park offers plenty of runnable paths, or head west into the neighborhoods if you need clear pavement.

### Air Quality Check

| Pollutant Type      | Level    |
| :------------------ | :------- |
| General AQI         | Moderate |
| Dominant Pollutant  | PM2.5    |
| Pollen              | Low      |

An AQI of 71, with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) as the dominant pollutant, means most healthy folks can get out there without major issues. However, if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally cranky lungs, you might want to consider keeping your strenuous efforts indoors today. It’s not a full-blown "stay inside" red alert like we saw last summer with the wildfire smoke, but it's not exactly mountain-fresh air either.

### Local Hazards to Watch For

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Lakefront Trail Closure: Oak Street to Ohio Street.** This section is *closed* due to weather conditions. Do not attempt to run, walk, or bike through it. Find an alternative route. Seriously.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Black Ice & Slippery Surfaces:** With temperatures hovering just above freezing during the day and dropping tonight, expect black ice, especially on bridges, overpasses, and shaded sections of paths. The National Weather Service is even forecasting light snow for Cook County later this evening, making things even more treacherous for late runs. Watch your footing, people.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Downtown Construction Impacts:** If you're running through the Loop, be aware of ongoing construction. Pedestrian access from Lake Street to 150 N. Riverside Plaza Upper Riverwalk is currently closed as part of the Lake Street Bascule Bridge rehabilitation. Keep your head up and stay aware of your surroundings near construction zones.
</AlertBox>

Lace up, stay warm, and don't be a hero trying to beat a trail closure. There's always tomorrow.
