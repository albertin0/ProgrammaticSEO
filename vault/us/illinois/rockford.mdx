Today's looking like a mixed bag for hitting the pavement or trails, Rockford runners.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 72 AQI, primarily due to inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) floating around. Your lungs might feel it if you push too hard.
*   Pollen count is blessedly low, so at least your sinuses get a break today.
*   Temperatures are hovering around 4.3°C (about 40°F) under clear skies, which is decent for a run, but the freeze-thaw cycle is going to make some trails a sloppy mess.
</BulletList>

Alright, Rockford, let's talk real. It's February 26th, and while the sun's out and the pollen's playing nice, don't let that fool you into thinking it's a perfect day for a PR. The air quality isn't exactly pristine, with that moderate AQI of 72. That means there's enough particulate matter (&lt;10µm) in the air to potentially irritate your respiratory system, especially if you're sensitive or planning a long, strenuous workout. So, take it down a notch, alright? This isn't the day to try and outrun a train, unless that train is also moving at a moderate pace.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Air: Moderate AQI
Your air quality index is at 72, which is moderate, with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) as the dominant pollutant. For most folks, this is probably fine for outdoor activity, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or other respiratory issues, or if you're just feeling a bit off, consider scaling back your intensity or duration. Don't push it.

Now, about those trails. While the air temperature is manageable at 4.3°C, we've been bouncing between freezing and thawing for a while now. This means any natural surface trails, like those out at **Atwood Park**, are likely to be a muddy, slippery mess in spots. You know the drill: frozen solid in the shade, soupy mud in the sun. If you insist on hitting the dirt, prepare for some extra ankle work and don't be that person who leaves deep ruts for everyone else. Stay on paved surfaces if you want to avoid a mud bath and a potential sprained ankle. The Rockford Park District often advises against using muddy trails to prevent damage anyway.

Speaking of surfaces, we didn't find any *new* trail closures or major construction *updates* directly impacting your run in the last 24 hours. However, ongoing large-scale projects, like the I-39 and U.S. 20 reconstruction, and bridge work over the Kishwaukee River, are expected to continue through 2026 and 2027, with daily lane closures. While these aren't blocking pedestrian paths *today*, it's always smart to stay aware of traffic patterns if your route takes you near these areas.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch Your Step: Slippery and Uneven Surfaces
That 4.3°C temperature means lingering patches of ice, thawing mud, and generally unstable ground, especially on unpaved trails. Expect uneven footing and increased slip hazards. Paved paths might still have slick spots from melting ice.

### Layer Up, Dummy!
It's clear, but 4.3°C isn't exactly shorts weather. Layer strategically. You'll warm up, but that post-run cool-down can hit hard. Think moisture-wicking base layers and a wind-resistant outer shell.
</AlertBox>

And a general reminder, because it always bears repeating: stay visible, especially if you're out near streets like Charles Street or the Rock River Recreation Path. There's always traffic, and pedestrian safety is an ongoing concern in our fair city. Don't assume drivers see you. Wear bright colors, use reflective gear, and maybe even a headlamp if you're out before dawn or after dusk.
