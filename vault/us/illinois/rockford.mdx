Alright, Rockford, time to talk turkey about your outdoor sweat session today.

It's a "meh, if you must, but don't push it" kind of day for pounding the pavement or trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Chilly Air & Moderate AQI:** At 1.1°C (34°F), it's cold enough to make those lungs ache if you go out too hard without a proper warm-up. Add in a moderate AQI of 75 with ozone as the dominant pollutant, and your airways aren't exactly getting a spa treatment.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Our fair city is basically one giant construction zone this year. You're going to hit ongoing projects all over, from major roadway overhauls like on US-20 and I-39 to the bridge work closing Meridian Road between IL 75 and Shirland Road. This means detours, uneven surfaces, and paying extra attention, even if you're not directly on a closed street.
*   **Clear Skies, But Dress Smart:** At least the skies are clear, so no icy rain or snow to contend with directly today. That said, 34 degrees isn't T-shirt weather. Layer up or face the consequences, you maniacs.

## The Rundown for February 28, 2026

So, you want to get outside? I get it. We're runners. We're a little masochistic. But let's be smart about it.

### Air Quality: Don't Be a Hero

That AQI of 75 means the air quality is moderate, largely thanks to ozone. For most of you, it's probably fine, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally sensitive lungs, take it easy. Maybe dial back the intensity on your planned tempo run along the Rock River Recreation Path. You don't need to be gasping for breath and inhaling extra ozone; that's just asking for trouble later.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert for Sensitive Lungs:** With an AQI of 75 and ozone as the main culprit, those with respiratory issues should consider a shorter, less intense workout, or maybe hit the treadmill. Your lungs will thank you.
</AlertBox>

### Weather Woes (or Lack Thereof)

The 1.1°C (34°F) and clear conditions are a mixed bag. It's cold enough that your muscles and joints will be tight if you skip a proper warm-up. Think about some dynamic stretches indoors before you even step foot outside. Your knees, especially, will appreciate it. No current weather alerts for Rockford for today, which is a blessing, but don't let the "clear" fool you into thinking it's balmy.

| Pollutant          | Level  |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| Tree Pollen        | Low    |
| Grass Pollen       | Low    |
| Weed Pollen        | Low    |
| Dominant Pollutant | Ozone  |

### Construction: Tread with Caution

Seriously, watch your step. Rockford's got more projects than potholes this year, and that's saying something. The city's multi-million dollar Capital Improvement Plan is kicking into high gear, meaning everything from bridge replacements (hello, 15th Avenue Bridge) to road revitalization on US-Bus-20. While much of the major construction traffic work on places like East State Street is slated for overnight hours, you can bet there are lingering effects. Expect uneven surfaces, reduced shoulder space, and probably some frustrated drivers on your usual routes.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Zone Etiquette:** Assume construction workers can't see you. Wear bright colors, make eye contact if possible, and just give 'em space. It's not worth arguing over a temporary detour.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Meridian Road Closure:** Remember, Meridian Road between IL 75 and Shirland Road is closed for bridge repairs over the Pecatonica River, a project that kicked off at the start of February. Plan your long runs accordingly if you usually use that stretch.
</AlertBox>

Bottom line: If you're heading out, bundle up, take it easy on the lungs, and keep your head on a swivel for traffic and uneven terrain. Rockford ain't built for speed right now, it's built for... well, it's being built.
