Today's not a complete bust for an outdoor workout, but you'll be dodging more than just slow walkers on the trail.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Air quality is sitting at a "moderate" 66 AQI, largely thanks to ozone. If your lungs are picky, you’ll notice it.
*   Construction crews are still running Aurora like their personal sandbox, so expect detours and closed paths, especially around major arteries and the High Line Canal.
*   There's a big race happening today, "That Dam Run," which means parts of Cherry Creek State Park could be a crowded mess.

## The Rundown: February 28, 2026

Alright, Aurora, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the dirt today. We’ve got clear skies and the temperature is starting out at a brisk 6.5°C, but AccuWeather says we're warming up nicely into the 20s Celsius (70s Fahrenheit) later on. So, at least you won’t freeze your bits off. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's smooth sailing.

### Air Quality: Moderate, Not Great

That AQI of 66? It's in the "moderate" zone because of ozone. For most of us, it’s not a huge deal, but if you've got asthma or are just generally sensitive, you might feel it. Your lungs might be working a little harder than usual, so keep your effort levels reasonable. This ain't the day to try for a PR if you're prone to a cough.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI is Moderate (66, Ozone).** Sensitive groups should probably take it easier today or consider an indoor alternative if you're feeling it. Your lungs will thank you.
</AlertBox>

### Construction Zone: Everywhere You Look

This is where it gets really fun. Aurora’s infrastructure overhaul is seemingly never-ending. If you were planning on a smooth ride or run, adjust your expectations.

Westbound Arapahoe Road near Peakview Drive still has two through lanes closed for a city water project today, so avoid that area if you can. Likewise, if your route takes you anywhere near Hoffman Boulevard between Del Mar Circle and Yuba Street, expect intermittent lane closures there too.

More importantly for runners and cyclists: the I-70 Picadilly Interchange. While the vehicle traffic might be open, the **bike and pedestrian pathway on the I-70 Picadilly Interchange is still closed until "later in spring 2026"**. That means no easy crossing there, folks. Picadilly Road itself also remains closed between Smith Road and East 19th Avenue.

And if you're a fan of the **High Line Canal Trail**, brace yourself. There's ongoing construction for a new accessible segment between I-70 and north of Colfax Avenue. Plus, the final mile and a half of the trail near the new Painted Prairie development (between E. 56th Ave and E. 64th Ave) is under construction, meaning no access in that section. Don't get caught out there.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Widespread Construction & Closures!** The I-70 Picadilly Interchange bike/pedestrian path is CLOSED. Sections of the High Line Canal Trail are under construction. Westbound Arapahoe Road and Hoffman Boulevard also have closures. Plan your routes carefully and assume delays or detours on major corridors.

### Event Alert: That Dam Run

Today's the day for "That Dam Run 13.1, 10K, 5K." While the exact course isn't always widely advertised beforehand, a name like that points directly to Cherry Creek State Park. Expect crowds, potential road closures (or at least heavy traffic), and general congestion if you're trying to use paths or roads in that vicinity. If you weren't registered, maybe opt for a different park today to avoid the race-day chaos.

### Wind and Fire: Still a Consideration

While the immediate "First Alert Weather Day" for high fire danger was for Thursday and Friday had a Red Flag Warning with gusts up to 40 mph, it's still prudent to be aware. February in Aurora is typically breezy, with average wind speeds around 10-12 mph and gusts that can hit over 40 mph. A clear day can mean dry conditions, and even moderate winds can quickly fan a spark. Be smart, don't throw your discarded gel wrappers into dry brush, and keep an eye on anything that looks suspicious.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration and Sun Protection:** With clear skies and warming temperatures, don't forget your water bottle and sunscreen, even in late February. The sun's strong here.
</AlertBox>

So, go get your miles in if you must, but be aware of your surroundings. Stay safe out there.
