Alright, Aurora. Today's a decent day to get outside, but don't expect it to be perfect.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

### Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Gorgeous Weather is a Go:** Clear skies and a mild 13.7°C (57°F for you Fahrenheit folks) mean you won't be battling the elements. No excuses for staying cooped up, unless you’re just lazy.</li>
  <li>**Pollen is Playing Nice:** With a "Low" pollen count, your sinuses can mostly chill out. Breathe easy, allergy sufferers.</li>
  <li>**Ozone's in the Air, So Be Aware:** That AQI of 71 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't terrible, but it's not stellar either. If you've got sensitive lungs, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to shorter bursts. This isn't the day for setting a new 5K PR if you're prone to wheezing.</li>
  <li>**Construction Never Sleeps:** Seriously, what's new? There are always some detours to contend with, and today's no different.</li>
</BulletList>

## Watch Out For:

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### Moderate Ozone Levels
  An AQI of 71, driven by ozone, is squarely in the "Moderate" category. For most of us, it means business as usual. However, if you're asthmatic, have other respiratory issues, or just notice you're more easily winded, consider a lower-intensity workout. Maybe skip those hill repeats and opt for a flat, steady pace instead. Listen to your body, not that Instagram influencer telling you to push through it.

<AlertBox type="info">
  ### High Line Canal Trail Detour Alert
  If your usual route takes you along the High Line Canal Trail, especially between E. 56th Ave and E. 64th Ave, be advised: there's no access through there. Construction for the new Painted Prairie development is ongoing, so you'll need to find an alternate route or just embrace the challenge of navigating the detour. They're also doing tree canopy care in spots, which could mean temporary closures. Always a good idea to check the Aurora Parks, Open Space & Trails website before you head out, because nothing ruins a run like hitting a dead end you weren't expecting.

  ### Nine Mile Bridge Project Kicking Off
  It's not impacting your run *today*, but keep an eye on the Nine Mile Bridge project. Construction for the new pedestrian and bike bridge over Parker Road, near I-225, is slated to start this winter (2025/2026) and will take about 18 months. This thing's been "long-awaited," so expect some local impacts once it really gets going. It's supposed to make getting to the RTD Nine Mile Station safer, which is great, but getting there during construction might be a headache.

Get out there, move your body, but don't be a hero about that ozone. Your lungs will thank you.
