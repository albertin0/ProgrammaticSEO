Alright, Aurora, it's a "mostly good, but watch your damn step" kind of day out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
  - The temperature is playing nice, but that moderate air quality due to ozone is still hanging around.
  - Wind gusts will make you feel that 50-degree air more than you'd like on your face.
  - Seriously, though, construction is everywhere, so your usual routes are probably a minefield.

## Today's Outdoor Rundown: Mind the Ozone and the Orange Cones

Today, February 26th, is offering up a relatively mild 12.5°C (that's about 54°F for you Celsius-averse folks) and clear skies. Sounds great, right? Almost too good for late February in Colorado. But don't let that tempt you into autopilot mode. The wind is clocking in around 10 to 20 mph, with some gusts that'll make those sunny patches feel a lot chillier than the thermometer suggests. Layers, people. This isn't groundbreaking advice, it's just common sense when the weather can't make up its mind.

Then there's the air. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 74, with ozone being the main culprit. For most of us, it's not a deal-breaker, but if your lungs get pissy with anything less than pristine air, you might feel it. Pay attention to how you're feeling, especially if you're pushing hard.

### Construction Chaos Continues

Here's the real kicker: Aurora's roadwork seems to be in a never-ending growth spurt. If you're planning a long run or a bike ride, assume your usual path is blocked or detoured. For instance, the major facelift happening at the **South Parker Road/East Quincy Avenue/East Smoky Hill Road intersection** is still ongoing, and it's not projected to wrap up until late 2026, possibly even March 2027. Expect daily lane closures there, Monday through Friday, from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. They're doing it to "improve pedestrian safety," which is noble, but also means new obstacles for you.

Beyond that, you've got intermittent lane closures on Hoffman Boulevard through the 28th, and westbound Iliff Avenue at Havana Street is losing a lane until tomorrow. And if you use I-70 near Colfax, prepare for alternating lane and shoulder closures that have been going on for months. Even parts of Smith Road are fully closed until April 30th. My point is, if you're heading out on two wheels or your own two feet, plan for the unexpected. These aren't just minor inconveniences; they can force you into traffic or onto unpaved shoulders.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is 74 due to ozone. If you're sensitive or have respiratory issues, consider scaling back the intensity or duration of your outdoor workout. Listen to your body.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Widespread Construction:** Major arteries and local streets are impacted by ongoing construction. Check the City of Aurora's roadwork updates before you head out, especially if your route involves the South Parker/Quincy/Smoky Hill intersection or I-70. Unexpected detours can be dangerous.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of trails, the final mile and a half of the High Line Canal Trail near the Painted Prairie development (between E. 56th Ave and E. 64th Ave) has no access due to construction. So, if that's part of your usual circuit, you'll need an alternate plan.

  **Wind Chill & Hydration:** While the temperature is moderate, the wind can quickly dry you out and make it feel colder. Hydrate before, during, and after your workout. A windbreaker isn't optional today.
</AlertBox>

No significant wildfires causing smoke in Aurora today, and no immediate flood warnings, which is a relief. Just good old ozone and relentless construction. Stay safe, Aurora.
