Alright, Denver, today is one of those frustrating "almost perfect" days that still demands caution if you're hitting the pavement or dirt.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>

*   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI is hanging around 72 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. While not "Unhealthy," it's enough to make sensitive lungs work a bit harder, especially on a longer run. AccuWeather even calls today's air quality "Poor" for sensitive groups, citing Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone levels.
*   **Winds & Fire Risk:** While the Red Flag Warning from yesterday (Wednesday) has expired, we're still under a Fire Weather Watch through Thursday afternoon for wind and low relative humidity, with gusts up to 40 mph. Translation: it's dry and windy, which means any spark is a bad idea, and frankly, running against a 40 mph headwind is just plain annoying.
*   **Persistent Trail Detours:** Don't expect smooth sailing on some of your usual routes. Several key sections are still under construction, forcing detours and adding mileage you didn't plan for.

## Today's Vitals

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant | Temperature (C) | Condition |
| :----------- | :---- | :----------------- | :-------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 72    | Ozone              | 14.2            | Clear     |

## Your Daily Hazards Rundown

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Air Quality for Sensitive Groups
With an AQI of 72 and ozone as the main culprit, those of you with asthma or other respiratory issues should consider scaling back your outdoor workout intensity and duration. If you're out there, try to avoid heavily trafficked areas where vehicle emissions might exacerbate the ozone.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Fire Weather Watch in Effect
The warm temperatures, dry conditions, and persistent strong winds (gusts up to 40 mph) are keeping us under a Fire Weather Watch. This means conditions are ripe for rapid fire spread if anything ignites. Don't be that person. Be extra careful with anything that could cause a spark – no open flames, no flicking cigarette butts (ever, but especially today). Seriously, avoid activities that could cause a spark.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Cherry Creek Trail & Other Trail Closures
Heads up, runners and cyclists! The **Cherry Creek Trail under Monaco Parkway is completely closed** for bridge reconstruction and will remain that way through summer 2026. You'll need to detour up to Monaco Parkway, cross at Florida Avenue, and find your way back. Similarly, the **Weir Gulch Trail** between the South Platte River Trail and Federal Blvd is also closed until May 31, 2026. And if you use the **South Platte River Trail**, specifically near Mississippi Avenue, expect ongoing construction and closures through late 2026. Plan your routes accordingly, or you'll be adding some unexpected crosswalk intervals to your workout.
