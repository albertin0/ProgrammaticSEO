Alright, Denver, step outside, but keep an eye on that horizon. It's a tricky day for some, not bad for others.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Fire Danger is Still a Thing:** Even with clear skies, those Red Flag Warnings from earlier in the week mean the Front Range is still dry and prone to sparks. Keep it respectful out there; nobody wants to be *that* person.
*   **Moderate Air Quality Means Pay Attention:** AQI is clocking in at 73 due to Ozone. For most of you iron-lunged folks, it’s probably fine, but if you're sensitive, or just pushing it hard, you might notice it.
*   **Ongoing Trail Hassles:** Looks like construction is still closing chunks of popular routes, so don't just blindly hit your usual path.

## The Rundown: Denver Workout Safety - February 26, 2026

Today's forecast is looking pretty decent with clear skies and a comfortable 12.3°C (around 54°F). That’s practically prime weather for breaking a sweat, but don't let the sunshine lull you into a false sense of security. We've still got a couple of things to watch out for if you're hitting the trails or parks.

First up, air quality. Your lungs are dealing with a Moderate AQI of 73, with Ozone being the dominant pollutant. While the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) anticipates generally good air quality, a "Moderate" rating means unusually sensitive individuals should consider dialing back prolonged or heavy exertion. For the rest of us, it’s likely okay, but if you feel it in your chest, listen to your body and cut your run short. This isn't the day to try for a PR if you're feeling anything but 100%.

The bigger concern continues to be fire danger. We had Red Flag Warnings blaring on Tuesday and Wednesday, with winds gusting up to 40-55 mph in the metro area, creating critical fire conditions. While today’s winds are expected to be breezy rather than extreme, the dry conditions that triggered those warnings are still very much present.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Red Flagged: Fire Danger Remains Elevated!**
Seriously, folks, no open flames, no flicking cigarette butts, and no activities that could throw a spark. Our Front Range is dry as a bone, and it doesn't take much to ignite a disaster. Be smarter than the average bear.

### Trail Report: Expect Detours, Always Check Before You Go

Don't assume your favorite route is clear. Construction is the name of the game in Denver, and several key pathways are impacted. For instance, a significant section of the **Cherry Creek Trail** is still closed near Monaco Parkway and will be until summer 2026. You’ll be rerouted up to Monaco and then down Florida Avenue. This isn't just a minor inconvenience; a huge "Cherry Creek West" project officially kicks off construction this year, so expect ongoing impacts around that area. Same goes for the Weir Gulch Trail, which is closed until May 31 for flood risk reduction work.

**Always Scope Out Your Route First**
With all the construction popping up like dandelions, seriously, check Denver Parks and Recreation's site or local trail groups before you head out. Don't waste your precious workout time hitting a dead end.

Finally, pollen is on the low side, so at least your sinuses aren't fighting you on top of everything else.

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant | Temperature (C) | Condition |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- | :-------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 73  | Ozone              | 12.3            | Clear     |
