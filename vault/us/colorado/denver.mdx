Alright, Denver, look. Today's one of those "could be worse, could be better" days for getting after it outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air's got a bit of an ozone funk. AQI's sitting at 67. If your lungs throw a tantrum over that, consider taking it easy.</li>
  <li>Don't let the clear skies fool you: yesterday was a Red Flag Warning for wildfire, and we’ve had *four* brush fires in the metro area this week, including an 8-acre blaze in Douglas County on Friday. That dry air and recent warmth isn't just for yesterday's news cycle.</li>
  <li>Your favorite trails might be a minefield of orange cones and "Trail Closed" signs. Plan ahead unless you enjoy impromptu urban navigation.</li>
</BulletList>

## Breathe Easy? Not So Fast, Champ.

Look, I get it. The sun's out, and that 6.5°C feels downright balmy for late February. But before you lace up and sprint out the door, let's have a real talk about what's actually happening out there.

First, the good news: pollen is low. So if your seasonal allergies usually make your eyeballs itch out of your head, you're probably in the clear on that front.

Now, for the reality check. Your lungs are going to be working with an AQI of 67, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. That's "Moderate." The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment straight-up said that if you're "unusually sensitive to ozone," you should think about cutting back on "prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion." So, if your chest feels tight after a vigorous session when the air's a bit spicy, maybe stick to a walk or hit the gym. Don't be a hero.

## Mind the Fires, Watch Your Step

Yesterday, the entire Denver metro area was under a Red Flag Warning because of dry conditions, warm temps (we hit 66 degrees on Friday), and gusty winds. Yeah, the warning itself expired, but the *conditions* that caused it? Still lurking. We've seen a rash of brush fires this week, including a couple in Douglas County. That's not just a headline; that's a reminder that this city is dry as a bone. So, if you're out there on any exposed trails, be hyper-aware. Don't flick anything, don't park on dry grass, and for the love of God, don't start any fires.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Wildfire Risk Remains Elevated:** Even without an active Red Flag Warning today, the underlying dry conditions and recent wildfire activity mean you need to be extremely cautious. One spark, and it's all over.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the delightful world of Denver construction. If you were planning on a nice, uninterrupted cruise along the **South Platte River Trail**, think again. Major sections are basically a permanent detour sign right now. The Weir Gulch Trail, which connects to the South Platte, is closed between the South Platte River Trail and Federal Blvd until May 31, 2026, for flood risk work. And down near Alameda, the South Platte River Trail is still closed due to the I-25 & Alameda Bridge Replacement. You'll be rerouted to S. Lipan Street. There's also ongoing widening projects near Virginia Avenue to Bayaud Avenue, and Globeville Levee improvements. So, what was once a smooth path is now a choose-your-own-adventure of construction fencing and dusty detours.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Trail Closures Galore:** The South Platte River Trail has multiple active construction closures and detours. Check the Denver Parks and Recreation site before you head out, or prepare for some unexpected route changes.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Stay Hydrated:** With the air still on the dry side, even in cooler temps, make sure you're drinking plenty of water, especially if you're pushing it.
</AlertBox>

In short, it's not the worst day, but it demands a dose of common sense. Respect the air quality warnings, be mindful of the lingering fire risk, and for crying out loud, know your route before you end up accidentally running through a construction zone.
