Alright, Denver, if you're thinking of hitting the trails today, you better hold onto your hat – literally. It's windy out there, and with those winds comes a real fire risk.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   Those "breezy" conditions from yesterday are still kicking, with sustained winds over 30 mph and gusts topping 40 mph. Forget a good hair day; just try not to get blown into Cherry Creek.
*   The National Weather Service has slapped us with a Fire Weather Watch today, Thursday, February 26th, from 11 AM to 5 PM. Low humidity, dry fuels, and those relentless gusts mean conditions are ripe for a blaze.
*   Air quality is moderate at an AQI of 71, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not a red alert, but if your lungs are touchy, pay attention.
</BulletList>

Honestly, today isn't the day to push it hard outside, especially if you're sensitive to air quality or just plain hate getting sandblasted. Your knees might appreciate the break from fighting the wind, and your lungs will thank you for not sucking down extra ozone on a high-exertion run. If you absolutely *must* get out, stick to lower intensity or shorter durations.

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### Fire Weather Watch & High Winds!
A Fire Weather Watch is active for Denver today, meaning critical fire conditions are expected due to low humidity and strong, gusty winds. These winds are no joke; sustained winds are above 30 mph with gusts over 40 mph. Not only is there a fire risk, but these winds can seriously impede your movement, kick up dust, and even knock down loose branches. Be extra vigilant about anything that could spark a fire, and consider running against the wind on your way out for an easier return trip.

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Moderate Air Quality
With an AQI of 71 and ozone as the main culprit, conditions are considered Moderate. While most people will be fine, if you're "unusually sensitive," consider scaling back your prolonged or heavy outdoor efforts. No need to develop a cough just for the sake of hitting that PR today.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
#### Trail Closure Alert: Weir Gulch Trail
Heads up if you typically run the Weir Gulch Trail. A significant portion between the South Platte River Trail and Federal Blvd is *closed* until May 31, 2026, for flood risk reduction and mobility improvements. Don't just show up and expect to power through; find an alternate route, or you'll be backtracking more than a lost tourist downtown. Check the City of Denver's trail detours before you head out, especially with ongoing projects like the Harvard Gulch Trail bridge replacement near DeBoer Park also impacting access until at least Feb 28.

Seriously, folks, Mother Nature's not pulling her punches today. Use your head, listen to your body, and maybe swap that intense trail run for a strong, steady effort on a protected path.
