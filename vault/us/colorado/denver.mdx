Alright, Denver, let's talk about hitting the trails today. This ain't a bad day for a run, but you definitely need to pay attention.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Red Flag Warning is ON:** That's not a drill, folks. Extreme fire danger means you need to be hyper-aware, especially near dry brush.
*   **Windy City Status:** We're talking gusts up to 40-44 mph in the metro area. Running into that is a special kind of hell, and debris can become a projectile.
*   **AQI is... fine enough:** It's moderate, mostly due to those inhalable particulates getting kicked up by the wind. Nothing to panic over for most, but if you're sensitive, keep it in mind.

## The Rundown

So, it's February 25th, and Denver is trying to convince us it's already spring with a balmy 17.9°C (that's pushing 64°F for those still in Fahrenheit land) and clear skies. The pollen is blissfully low, which is a rare win for your sinuses. However, the wind gods are clearly upset about something, whipping up gusts strong enough to make you question your life choices on an exposed stretch of trail. We're looking at consistent breezy conditions, with actual gusts reported up to 44 mph.

### Fire Danger is Real

Let's cut to the chase: The entire Denver metro and Front Range foothills are under a Red Flag Warning for fire danger today. This isn't some far-off mountain problem; it applies right here. That combination of warm temps, dry conditions, and those persistent, gusty winds means a spark could turn into a serious problem fast. Elevated fire danger is expected to continue through Friday. So, if you're out there, for the love of all that is holy, be mindful. No discarded cigarettes, no parking on dry grass if you can avoid it, and absolutely no shenanigans that could start a blaze. Seriously, don't be *that* person.

### RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT!
High winds, warm temperatures, and dry conditions mean extreme fire danger across the Denver metro area and Front Range foothills today. Use extreme caution and report any suspicious activity immediately.

### Your Lungs & Knees (and what's closed)

Your lungs are probably going to be okay with the low pollen count, but the moderate AQI (59), driven by inhalable particulate matter, isn't ideal when you're sucking wind at tempo pace. That's just dust getting thrown around by the wind, but if you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, you might feel it.

As for your joints, the warm weather is nice, but those strong headwinds are going to add significant resistance and strain, potentially messing with your form. If you plan on tackling the **Cherry Creek Trail** near Monaco Street, be advised that section is still closed for bridge replacement and flood mitigation, with detours in place up to Monaco Parkway and Florida Avenue through summer 2026. Same goes for the **Harvard Gulch Trail** where the DeBoer Park Bridge is getting replaced – that project's construction phase for the bridge and storm sewer finishes up February 28, 2026, but expect continued impacts. And don't forget the **Weir Gulch Trail** is closed between the South Platte River Trail and Federal Blvd until May 31, 2026, for flood risk reduction work. Always check local resources before you head out, because Denver loves to tear up trails more than a puppy loves a new chew toy.

### Trail Detour Reminder:
Several popular trails, including sections of the Cherry Creek Trail, Harvard Gulch Trail (DeBoer Park Bridge), and Weir Gulch Trail, have ongoing closures and detours. Plan your route accordingly and obey all signage.
