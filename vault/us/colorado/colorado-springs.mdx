Another February day in Colorado Springs, which usually means "bundle up and hope for the best." Today? Yeah, you can get out there, but don't expect smooth sailing everywhere.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is hitting a moderate 65, thanks to ozone. Not terrible, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you'll feel it. Keep your runs shorter and maybe dial back the intensity.
*   It's still chilly out there, hovering around 4.5°C (40°F). Don't let the "clear" skies fool you; that ground can still be slick in spots, especially where the sun hasn't hit or if you're venturing into higher, shadier elevations where some light snow might have lingered from earlier in the week.
*   Good news for the sniffly crowd: pollen levels are mercifully low. You can breathe *that* sigh of relief.

## The Rundown on Hazards

Alright, let's talk real talk. This city is constantly building or fixing something, and it's no different today.

### Trail and Open Space Annoyances

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads up on Fountain Creek Regional Trail!** There's a significant, ongoing closure from Stratmoor Valley Park and Trailhead south to Camping World. This isn't just a quick detour; it's closed through late April for a powerline upgrade. Don't plan your long run down there unless you enjoy dead ends and backtracking.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Stratton Open Space** is a bit of a minefield right now. The South Suburban Reservoir is off-limits entirely, and you can expect intermittent closures on the Ridgeway Trail. There's repair work and fire mitigation happening, which means construction vehicles on N. Cheyenne Canyon Road and rolling closures. Obey those signs, people. They're there for a reason, not to test your trailblazing skills.
</AlertBox>

Over at **Blodgett Open Space**, expect to see plenty of action with 14 miles of trail construction and trailhead projects continuing throughout 2026. You might find new parking, which is great, but also expect active work zones.

### Road and Urban Obstacles

If you're pounding the pavement, the **Powers Boulevard and Airport Road** interchange is still getting its fancy new diverging diamond sorted. Parts opened up earlier this week, but detours are definitely a thing, so watch out for traffic pattern shifts if you're cycling or running near Peterson Space Force Base.

Also, if your route takes you downtown, be aware that a massive construction crane just rolled onto the **Palmer High School** site at the end of February. While this isn't directly on a trail, it means more heavy equipment and potential traffic snarls in the downtown core if you're navigating that area. The Tejon Street revitalization project is also ongoing, which can mean narrower sidewalks and general downtown chaos.

**I-25** still has planned overnight lane closures in the pipeline, shifted to the week of March 2, so keep an eye on that for any early morning or late evening runs near the highway. And **US 24 westbound** between Bijou Street and Airport Road is under construction until April.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

<AlertBox type="info">
Even with low pollen, carry some water. Today's moderate AQI with ozone as the dominant pollutant means staying hydrated is always a good call. Also, layers are your friend with these chilly temps. And for the love of Pikes Peak, tell someone where you're going if you're hitting the more remote sections of those open spaces.
