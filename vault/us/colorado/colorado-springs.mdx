Looks, today is *not* your day for a PR, unless "PR" stands for "Ponderous Ruck-up."

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Red Flag Warning is ON, people.** That means high fire danger with critical wind and dry conditions. Seriously.
*   **Winds are whipping.** Expect gusts up to 45 mph today. That's not a gentle breeze; that's "get blown off the trail" territory.
*   **Construction chaos continues.** Multiple major arteries and favorite trails are impacted.
</BulletList>

Forget about that blissful morning run where you just zone out. Today requires active navigation, constant awareness, and frankly, a healthy dose of paranoia. The entire Pikes Peak region, especially areas below 6,000 feet, is under a Red Flag Warning. What does that mean for your lungs? Extremely low humidity, 5-10% in some spots, combined with those strong downslope winds, makes for some seriously dry, irritating air. Your respiratory system is going to feel it, even with the "Low" pollen count.

### Environmental Breakdown

| Factor           | Status      | Notes                                                              |
| :--------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pollen Level** | Low         | One less thing to worry about, but don't get too comfortable.      |
| **Air Quality**  | AQI 74      | Moderate, dominant pollutant is Ozone. Not great, not terrible.    |
| **Temperature**  | 15.7°C (60°F) | Unseasonably warm, which usually feels nice, but the wind cancels it out. |
| **Wind Gusts**   | Up to 45 mph | A major hazard for stability and stirring up whatever isn't nailed down. |

### Red Flag Warning & Extreme Winds: Stay Alert!
Today, February 25, 2026, a Red Flag Warning is in effect for Colorado Springs due to gusty winds, unseasonably warm temperatures, and extremely low humidity. This means any spark can turn into a wildfire *fast*. Avoid any activities that could cause a spark, and if you're out on the trails, understand that conditions can change rapidly. The winds themselves are a physical hazard; you could easily be pushed off balance, especially if you're cycling or running near exposed areas. Gusts are forecast up to 45 mph, making any outdoor activity significantly more challenging and risky.

### Construction Zones: Watch Your Step (and Your Route)
Don't even think about a smooth, uninterrupted long run on the **Sinton Trail** today if you planned on going under I-25. It's closed for construction until March 22nd for girder placement, with detours sending you onto busy streets. Similarly, the **Fountain Creek Regional Trail** is shut down from Stratmoor Valley Park to Camping World until April 24th for powerline upgrades. If you're running or cycling on roads, be aware of major traffic pattern shifts around Powers Boulevard and Airport Road, where a new diverging diamond interchange is opening but some ramps aren't fully done. South Academy Boulevard and Dublin Boulevard also have ongoing lane closures and traffic shifts.

### Your Best Bet Today
If you absolutely *must* get out, consider indoor alternatives. Seriously. If you're stubborn and heading outside, stick to known, paved routes away from open spaces and construction zones. Wear bright colors, carry water (the dry air will dehydrate you quickly), and ditch the headphones so you can hear approaching vehicles or any sudden changes in wind direction. Choose shoes with good grip. And for the love of all that is holy, check the forecast one more time before you step out.
