Alright, Colorado Springs. Is today the day to hit those trails? Nah, not really.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Red Flag Warning is ON:** We've got critical fire weather conditions until 6 PM, folks. Strong winds and bone-dry air mean any spark, and I mean *any* spark, could turn into a serious problem in a hurry.</li>
  <li>**Windy City:** Get ready to battle northwest winds gusting up to 40-45 mph. That’s not just annoying; it’s a legitimate hazard for balance, blowing debris, and pushing you into traffic if you’re not careful. Cycling? Forget about it.</li>
  <li>**Smoke Check:** There's an active fire burning on Fort Carson. Crews are on it, but smoke is expected to be visible across the area. Combine that with moderate ozone levels in our AQI, and your lungs will thank you for taking it inside.</li>
  <li>**Trail Troubles:** Several of our favorite running spots have ongoing issues. The **Fountain Creek Regional Trail** is shut down from Stratmoor Valley Park to Camping World until April 24th for powerline upgrades. And don't even think about the Sinton Trail under I-25; that's closed for construction too.</li>
</BulletList>

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

| Pollutant | Level | Notes |
| :-------- | :---- | :---- |
| AQI       | 67    | Moderate (Ozone dominant) |
| Tree Pollen | Low   | Go you! |
| Grass Pollen| Low   | Still low! |
| Weed Pollen | Low   | Can't blame the weeds today. |

## What You Need To Know Today

Today is a prime example of why you can't just look at a "clear skies" forecast and assume it's golden for an outdoor sweat session. That 11.7°C (53°F) might feel nice, but it's playing a dangerous game with our dry landscape. The National Weather Service Pueblo has been pretty clear: this combination of strong winds, warm temps, and ridiculously low humidity (down to 9 percent!) creates a powder keg.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **EXTREME FIRE DANGER: RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT!** Do NOT engage in any activities that could cause a spark. This includes discarded cigarettes, parking on dry grass, or anything else that could ignite a blaze. The City of Colorado Springs has burn restrictions in place.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, folks. That fire on Fort Carson? It's proof that this isn't just some abstract warning. Smoke in the air, even if it's not thick, combined with ozone, is an unnecessary strain on your respiratory system. Your lungs will be doing double duty trying to filter that mess out, and trust me, they've got better things to do than deal with your stubborn "I need to run outside" attitude.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **HIGH WINDS ARE NO JOKE!** Gusts up to 45 mph will make maintaining balance difficult, especially if you're on a bike or trying to manage a long run. Secure anything loose in your yard, and reconsider heading out to open areas like the Red Rock Canyon Open Space, where you'll be exposed to the full force of it.
</AlertBox>

Look, I get it. We live here for the outdoors. But sometimes, Mother Nature throws a curveball, and today is one of those days. There's plenty of time for heroics on the trails when the conditions are actually *safe*. Instead of fighting the wind and breathing in ozone and potential smoke, head to an indoor track, hit a gym, or do some bodyweight work at home. Your future self, and the Colorado Springs Fire Department, will thank you.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **CHECK TRAIL STATUS BEFORE YOU GO!** With ongoing projects like the powerline upgrade on Fountain Creek Regional Trail and I-25 construction impacting the Sinton Trail, unexpected detours and closures are common. Don't waste your time driving to a trailhead only to find it blocked.
