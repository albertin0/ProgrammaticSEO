Alright, Colorado Springs. You woke up to a mixed bag today, and honestly, it’s a bit of a gamble if you want to hit the trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Fire Danger is REAL:** We've got a Red Flag Warning slapped on Southern El Paso County, including our beloved Springs, until 6 PM. That means dry conditions, warm temps, and winds gusting up to 45 mph are a recipe for disaster. On top of that, there's an actual fire burning on Fort Carson that's only 30% contained, and you can bet your bottom dollar that smoke is making its way to us. If you're out there, you're not just risking your lungs, you're potentially putting first responders at risk if something sparks.
*   **Gusty Winds, Shmusty Runs:** While the temperature is a pleasant 12.7°C, those winds, coupled with the fire danger, aren't just an inconvenience; they're a hazard. They'll kick up dust, spread any lingering smoke, and generally make your run feel like you're fighting a invisible wall.
*   **Construction Zone City:** Your usual routes might be a mess. Between the Powers Boulevard Extension kicking off bridge construction, the ongoing South Academy Boulevard improvements, and the Dublin Boulevard lane shifts, getting to your preferred starting point could be a headache. Don't even think about the Fountain Creek Regional Trail right now; it's shut down from Stratmoor Valley Park to Camping World until late April for powerline upgrades.

### Air Quality Report

| Pollutant      | AQI  | Level    | Dominant Pollutant |
| :------------- | :--- | :------- | :----------------- |
| Overall (Ozone)| 66   | Moderate | Ozone              |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Red Flag Warning in Effect!** Seriously, folks. The National Weather Service means it. Elevated fire danger means any spark, any flicked cigarette butt, any hot exhaust near dry grass could start a blaze. Combined with the Fort Carson fire, consider the air quality compromised even if the AQI numbers look "moderate." Smoke is an irritant, and ozone isn't doing your lungs any favors.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail & Road Closures Galore.** If you usually run, bike, or walk through Stratton Open Space, be aware that while the park is open, the South Suburban Reservoir is indefinitely closed, and the Ridgeway Trail might have intermittent closures due to repair work. Always check city updates before you head out, and if you see signs, obey them. Don't be "that guy" who thinks the rules don't apply to them.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Eyes on the Sky (and the News).** Given the fire conditions, keep an eye on local news for sudden changes in warnings or advisories. If you see smoke, particularly if it's growing or moving quickly, report it and get yourself to safety. Signing up for Peak Alerts isn't just for emergencies; it keeps you informed.
</AlertBox>

Honestly, if you *must* get your miles in today, stick to indoor options or a very contained neighborhood loop where you're not kicking up dust, breathing questionable air, or adding to the general chaos of construction. Your lungs, joints, and frankly, our firefighters, will thank you.

*Data grounded with KRDO, City of Colorado Springs, and AccuWeather from February 26, 2026.*
