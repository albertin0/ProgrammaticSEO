## Today's Fort Collins Outlook: Wind-Whipped Trails & Ozone Warnings

Alright, Fort Collins, here's the brutally honest truth for your Saturday sweat session. If you can dodge the wind and construction, it's a tolerable day for a run, but don't get complacent.

<BulletList>
  - **Red Flag Warning:** High winds and dry conditions mean elevated fire danger, so keep your head up and respect any potential advisories.
  - **Moderate Ozone:** While not terrible, sensitive individuals might feel it in their lungs during heavy exertion.
  - **Trail Closures Continue:** Your usual routes might be blocked, so plan ahead for detours.
</BulletList>

Let's talk specifics. The air is generally looking decent with a **Low** pollen count, so your sinuses should be mostly unbothered. However, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at **59** with **Ozone** as the dominant pollutant. For most of you, that's fine, but if you're like me and have lungs that prefer pristine mountain air, you might notice a little extra burn during hard efforts. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued a forecast indicating moderate ozone concentrations are possible across the Front Range, including Fort Collins, and advised unusually sensitive individuals to consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion on Friday and Saturday.

Now for the real kick in the pants: the weather. We're looking at a clear morning turning cloudy, with temperatures around **4.4°C (40°F)**, eventually climbing to a mild **66°F (19°C)** later in the day. Sounds great, right? Wrong. The National Weather Service has slapped a **Red Flag Warning** on Larimer County from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM today, Saturday, February 28th. This isn't just a friendly suggestion; it means high winds, low humidity, and dry ground are creating prime wildfire conditions. Xcel Energy is even monitoring wildfire risk, so be extra vigilant. That "light breeze" you're hoping for could be a 40 mph gust that sends you into a ditch or, worse, spreads a spark.

### Hazards on the Hoof

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Red Flag Warning in Effect!** High winds, low humidity, and dry conditions mean elevated fire danger across Larimer County today. Be extremely careful with anything that could spark a fire, and consider postponing exposed trail runs where winds could be brutal.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Moderate Ozone for Sensitive Lungs:** With an AQI of 59, those with respiratory sensitivities might experience symptoms from the ozone. If you're unusually sensitive, consider taking it easy on those longer, harder efforts outdoors.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Fossil Creek Trail Closure:** A significant stretch of the Fossil Creek Trail between Trilby and Carpenter Road remains fully closed until March 31, 2026, for stream rehabilitation. Don't expect to pass through; you'll need to use detours on sidewalks along Trilby, Lemay, and Carpenter.
</AlertBox>

If you're heading out on the **Poudre River Trail**, remember it's winter, folks. While the path might look clear in spots, shady sections can be absolute ice rinks, and the trail isn't actively maintained for winter conditions. Assume slick spots and choose your footwear accordingly. Also, the final gap of the Poudre River Trail between Timnath and Windsor is an active construction zone, so don't try to push through there.

Finally, a heads up for those in the area of **Lee Martinez Park**: there's a T&H 10K race happening today. Expect more foot traffic than usual, and potentially some temporary course markings or minor congestion.

Stay safe out there, Fort Collins. Don't be that runner who ignores the warnings.
