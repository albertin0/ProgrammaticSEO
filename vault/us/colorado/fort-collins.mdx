Alright, Fort Collins, if you were planning to get out there today, Feb 26th, you better be ready to fight the wind and dodge some construction cones.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   Those "gentle breezes" you love so much? They're whipping up to dangerous levels, pushing a Red Flag Warning for fire danger across the Front Range. No, seriously, it's that bad.
*   Your lungs might be singing the blues. While the general AQI is "Moderate," AccuWeather says it's "Poor" for sensitive groups thanks to ozone.
*   Good luck finding an uninterrupted stretch of pavement or dirt; the trail closures are *everywhere* right now.
</BulletList>

### Lungs: Don't Breathe Fire, Just Air (Mostly)

So, your Ambee data says AQI is 68, which is "Moderate." Okay, fine, for most of us, that's just a Tuesday. But if your respiratory system is already prone to a dramatic flair, AccuWeather is calling it "Poor" for sensitive groups today. The dominant pollutant is ozone, which loves to mess with your airways. If you've got asthma, COPD, or just a general aversion to feeling like you've run through a dusty attic, maybe keep it indoors or hit the treadmill. Or at least slow down and pay attention to how you feel.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI for Sensitive Lungs:** If you're in a sensitive group, today's "Poor" air quality forecast means you might experience some minor to moderate symptoms. Stick to shorter, less intense workouts, or just bite the bullet and stay inside.
</AlertBox>

### Joints: Prepare for a Gusty Gauntlet

The biggest concern today for your joints – and frankly, your entire existence – is the wind. We're under a Red Flag Warning for fire danger, and that means some serious gusts. Winds could hit up to 40 mph in Fort Collins, and if you head up towards the foothills, we're talking 80 mph. This isn't just an annoying headwind; this is "get knocked off your feet" wind, "flying debris" wind. A twisted ankle from an unexpected gust or an airborne branch is a real possibility.

Beyond the wind, Fort Collins is basically one giant construction zone. You want to run the Fossil Creek Trail between Trilby and Carpenter? Nope, that's closed until the end of March for some stream rehab. Good luck navigating that mess. Eastbound Horsetooth at Stanford Road is closed today for utility repairs. And don't even think about Mountain Vista between Timberline and Giddings; that culvert replacement has it shut down until May.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Red Flag Warning & Extreme Winds:** Seriously, don't underestimate this. Gusts up to 40 mph are no joke. Head outside at your own risk for falls and flying debris. If you're thinking of hitting higher elevations, forget it. Fire danger is high.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Upcoming Power Trail Closure:** Starting March 2nd (next Monday!), a section of the Power Trail between Harmony and Prospect Roads along Timberline will be fully closed for fiber installation until March 19th. Plan your detours now, folks.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Low          | N/A           |

Yeah, the pollen is low. That's about the only good news your lungs are getting today.

### Overall

Honestly, it's a bit of a crapshoot out there. The clear skies and mild temps are tempting, but the aggressive winds and air quality issues for some, combined with the usual Fort Collins obstacle course of trail closures, make it a day for extreme caution or just hitting the gym. Or, you know, doing some planks in your living room. Your PT highly recommends it.
