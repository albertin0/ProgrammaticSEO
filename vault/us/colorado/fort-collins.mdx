Alright, Fort Collins, you've got some trade-offs today if you want to hit the trails, so lace up, but keep your head on a swivel.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Enjoy the glorious mid-50s temps and blessedly low pollen count, because those are definitely the best things going for you.
*   Get ready to feel like you're running into a hairdryer, thanks to those persistent 30-40mph wind gusts and the accompanying Red Flag Warning for fire danger.
*   Good luck navigating your favorite routes; significant trail closures mean you'll be improvising more than a jazz musician on the Poudre River Trail.

## The Rundown

Look, I'm a runner, I get it. We take what we can get in late February. And 14.5°C (that's pushing 58°F for those still on Fahrenheit island) with clear skies? That's practically a spring day, and a welcome break from the usual winter slog. Plus, your sinuses can breathe easy with a "Low" pollen level, which is a rare gift this time of year.

However, let's not pretend it's all sunshine and PRs. We're still dealing with some decidedly Colorado issues.

### Air Quality & Allergens

| Factor            | Level    | Notes                                                              |
| :---------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AQI**           | 58       | Moderate, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant.                    |
| **Tree Pollen**   | Low      | Your nose and throat can mostly chill today.                       |

An AQI of 58 isn't terrible, but it's not "Good" either. It's that awkward middle ground. Ozone being the main culprit means it's still worth being mindful, especially if you're prone to respiratory drama. It's not the wildfire smoke we sometimes get, which is a relief, but moderate ozone can still be an irritant for sensitive lungs during high exertion.

## The Hazards Out There

<AlertBox type="warning">
### **Wind & Fire Danger: Not Your Friend**

Don't let the nice temperature fool you. We're under a Red Flag Warning for fire danger, which started earlier this week and is sticking around. We're looking at wind gusts in the 30-40 mph range in Fort Collins today. That's not a gentle breeze, folks; that's "I'm fighting a wall of air and possibly getting sandblasted" wind. It'll sap your energy, make those contact lenses feel like sandpaper, and turn any uphill into a demoralizing ordeal. And remember, those strong, dry winds coupled with our dry ground conditions mean fire can spread fast.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
### **Trail Closures: Your Patience, Tested**

If your go-to is the **Fossil Creek Trail** between Trilby and Carpenter, tough luck. That section is fully closed until March 31st for the Stanton Creek rehabilitation project. You'll be rerouted onto sidewalks along Trilby, Lemay, and Carpenter, which are hardly the same for a good run or ride. And it's not the only one: you've also got an eastbound Horsetooth closure at Stanford Road for utility repairs today, so plan your vehicular routes accordingly. Mountain Vista between Timberline and Giddings is also closed until April, among others. Assume your usual path is probably blocked somewhere, so check the city's construction and traffic impacts page before you head out.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### **Pro Tip: Embrace the Detour (and the Dirt)**

Since half our paved trails seem to be under construction, consider hitting up some of the less-trafficked dirt paths or neighborhood streets today, assuming they're clear of debris from the wind. It'll save your joints from repetitive pounding on pavement, and sometimes a change of scenery is exactly what you need when your usual loop is a construction zone. Just watch for dust kicked up by the wind, especially in drier areas.
</AlertBox>

Overall, a decent day to get outside if you don't mind a serious headwind and don't rely on specific trail segments. Just be smart about your route and hydrate, because that wind will dry you out faster than a forgotten bagel on your kitchen counter.
