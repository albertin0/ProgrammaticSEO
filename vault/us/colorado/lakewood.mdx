Today? It’s a pretty decent day to get out there and actually enjoy the fresh (mostly) air.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The weather is clear and mild, hitting about 14°C (58°F), which is practically perfect for a late February run or ride. No excuses about freezing your assets off.
*   Pollen is low, so your nose won't be staging a full-scale rebellion if you hit the trails.
*   AQI is moderate thanks to some ozone, so don't go trying to set any world records for lung capacity. Take it easy.
</BulletList>

## Why today is/isn't the day

Look, we're not dealing with a blizzard or a wildfire evacuation, so let's call it a win. That 14°C is glorious for anyone who's been stuck on a treadmill all winter. Go ahead and tackle some of those inclines at William Frederick Hayden Park. Just remember to hydrate, because even though it's not scorching, that Colorado sun at elevation can still sneak up on you.

The big bummer is the AQI hitting 65, with ozone as the main culprit. Moderate air quality isn't going to kill you, but it’s definitely not ideal for high-intensity efforts, especially if you've got any underlying respiratory issues. If you're planning on hammering out intervals or going for a PR, maybe scale it back a notch. Your lungs will thank you.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |
| Tree        | Low     |
| Grass       | Low     |
| Weed        | Low     |

No need to pre-dose your antihistamines like you're going into battle. The pollen count is mercifully low across the board today. Enjoy it while it lasts, because we all know what spring brings to the Front Range.

<AlertBox type="warning">
That moderate AQI is no joke. Ozone, even at these levels, can irritate your respiratory system. If you're prone to asthma or have sensitive lungs, consider moving your workout indoors or sticking to a lower intensity. Don't push it too hard around Alameda and Wadsworth, where traffic exhaust might exacerbate the situation.

<AlertBox type="info">
With the mild temperatures, it’s easy to forget that the sun is still strong out here. Slap on some sunscreen and wear sunglasses, especially if you're going to be out for more than an hour. Nobody wants to finish a run looking like a lobster.

<AlertBox type="info">
The City of Lakewood usually keeps its park paths and trails clear, but always be aware of your surroundings. While there are no widespread reports of closures due to hazards like construction or flooding today, a quick check of the city's official parks and recreation site before you head out is never a bad idea. Seriously, just take two seconds.

### Local Hazards Update

Good news, folks: the local news from the last 24 hours isn't screaming about any major workout-stopping hazards in Lakewood. No crazy high winds trying to blow you into traffic on Wadsworth, no unexpected flooding closing down the trails near Bear Creek Lake Park, and no active wildfires stinking up the air. It seems like a relatively calm day on the hazard front, which, for Colorado, is saying something. Just be smart about the ozone and enjoy the nice weather while we've got it.
