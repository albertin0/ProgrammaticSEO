It’s February in Colorado, and frankly, you could do a whole lot worse than today's conditions for logging some outdoor miles around Lakewood. Get out there, but keep your head on a swivel.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   You've got pleasantly mild temperatures topping out around 5.6°C (that’s 42°F for those of you still clinging to Fahrenheit), with clear skies and barely any wind. Combine that with a "Low" pollen count, and your lungs will probably thank you.
*   The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 65, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. This usually means things are worse in the afternoon and evening, so if you're sensitive, maybe hit the pavement earlier.
*   While the city’s general trail status says "open" for most spots like the Bear Creek Greenbelt and William F. Hayden Park at Green Mountain, don't be a hero. A lot of our unpaved trails get notoriously muddy with any moisture, and "clear" skies don't dry out deep mud overnight. If you see signs, turn around. It saves your shoes and the trail.

**Watch Your Step (and Your Surroundings) Near Green Mountain**
While it’s a beautiful day, those soft-surface trails up on Green Mountain can still be a sloppy mess. Don’t be that person creating wider trails by going around mud pits. If it's too wet, find a paved route or hit the road. Also, keep an eye on the forecast; the National Weather Service was calling for winds gusting up to 22 mph yesterday, so while today is milder, it's always good to be aware of the potential for sudden changes.

**Good News for Bear Creek Lake Park Runners**
Remember all that hullabaloo about potentially expanding Bear Creek Lake and flooding hundreds of acres of trails? Looks like that plan has pretty much sunk. Due to funding issues and community opposition, a massive reservoir expansion that would have swallowed up sections of the park's beloved trails is off the table, at least for the foreseeable future. So, you can keep enjoying those miles along the creek.

**Heads Up Around Aviation Park**
Recent reports from mid-February indicated that while Aviation Park itself was cleared of encampments, issues regarding safety, sanitation, and potential drug use persisted just a block in any direction. While the city is working on longer-term solutions, it's wise to remain aware of your surroundings in that area, especially if running alone or during off-peak hours.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today's shaping up to be a pretty solid day to break a sweat. Just be smart about your trail choices and give a wide berth to any construction zones or areas that feel a little off. No heroics, just good, honest running.
