If you're eyeing an outdoor workout in Tacoma today, February 28, 2026, you'd better bundle up and keep your lungs in mind, because it's a mixed bag out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** An AQI of 72 with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) is sitting squarely in the "Moderate" category. That's not terrible, but if you've got sensitive lungs or any respiratory issues, you'll feel it more than usual. It's definitely a step up from the "Good" readings we saw earlier this week.
*   **Chilly but Clear:** It's a brisk 4°C out there, but at least the skies are clear. Perfect for layering, not so much for forgetting your gloves.
*   **Sneaker Wave Alert for the Coast:** If your run takes you along the water, especially anywhere near Ruston Way or Dune Peninsula Park, watch out. There's a moderate threat of sneaker waves at the coast through today. These aren't your friendly little lappers; they can knock you off your feet.

Great news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are mercifully low today, so at least your sinuses can catch a break.

## Watch Out for These Hazards

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Air Quality (PM10)

With an AQI of 72 and PM10 as the dominant pollutant, your lungs might not be thrilled, especially if you're pushing the pace. The Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department advises that those with heart or lung disease, asthma, or who are otherwise sensitive, should limit prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Consider dialing back your intensity or opting for an indoor workout if you're in a sensitive group.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Sneaker Wave Threat Along the Waterfront

Heads up, waterfront warriors! The National Weather Service has issued a moderate threat for sneaker waves at the coast through today. This means if you're running on Ruston Way or any other coastal path, keep a wide berth from the water. These waves can appear out of nowhere, pull you in, and it's not worth the risk for a few extra steps. Keep kids and pets close, and stay vigilant.

### Chilly Temps & Local Events

The 4°C temperature means you'll need proper layers to stay warm, especially with any breeze coming off the Puget Sound. While the skies are clear, that doesn't mean it's balmy.

Also, if your route takes you anywhere near E D Street today, be aware that the Asia Pacific Cultural Center's 28th Annual New Year Celebration is in full swing from 11 AM to 6 PM. Expect crowds, potential traffic, and general merriment that might slow your pace.

And for those heading to Point Defiance Park, remember there's still a general traffic detour in effect. Drive with caution and share the road, even if it's an older alert, it's always good to be mindful in our biggest urban park.
