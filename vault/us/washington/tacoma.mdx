Alright Tacoma, listen up. Today's a pretty solid day to get your miles in, but don't slack on checking those air quality alerts.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI is flirting with the "unhealthy for sensitive groups" line thanks to ozone. Don't be a hero if your lungs are easily annoyed.
*   **Chilly but Clear Skies:** We're sitting at a crisp 5.4°C (about 42°F) under clear skies. Ideal layering weather, but don't forget it's still winter out there.
*   **Street Closures in North Tacoma:** Several residential streets are undergoing restoration. If your route takes you through North Winnifred, North Bennett, North Ferdinand, or North Mullen, expect detours.

## Your Daily Tacoma Run-Down

Today, February 26th, is shaping up to be one of those classic Pacific Northwest winter days where it *looks* inviting, but has a few sneaky caveats. The sun's out, which is a win in itself this time of year, and the air is dry enough that you probably won't be slogging through puddles – for today, at least. We've had some atmospheric river shenanigans up and down the coast, but Tacoma seems to have dodged the immediate deluge for now.

However, let's talk lungs. That AQI of 68 means "Moderate" air quality, with ozone being the main culprit. For most of us, it's fine. But if you're like me and your chest gets tight just looking at a slight haze, consider taking it easy. Point Defiance Park's trails might be calling, and usually, they're a great escape from city air, but even there, that moderate AQI is something to consider. Maybe skip setting any PBs today, okay?

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up on Air Quality!** While the overall pollen count is low, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is at 68 due to ozone. If you have respiratory sensitivities, consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. A short, brisk walk along Ruston Way might be a better choice than a lung-busting hill repeat session up 6th Avenue.

Temperature-wise, 5.4 degrees Celsius is cool. It's a "dress in layers" kind of day. Start a bit bundled, and you'll warm up. A light windbreaker, long sleeves, and maybe some gloves for the first mile or two should do the trick. No icy winds ripping off the water today, which is a blessing.

Now, for those of you who stick to the city streets or shorter loops, be aware of ongoing construction. The City of Tacoma has several residential street restoration projects underway. Specifically, streets like North Winnifred, North Bennett, North Ferdinand, and North Mullen are slated for maintenance work starting this week and continuing through mid-April, weather permitting. This means potential detours, uneven surfaces, and shared road space with equipment. It's less of a "danger" and more of an "annoyance," but nobody wants to accidentally roll an ankle on a fresh patch of torn-up pavement. Keep your head up and stay aware of your surroundings.

Overall, get out there, enjoy the clear skies while they last, but be smart about your effort and watch where you're going.
