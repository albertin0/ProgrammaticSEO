It's a "take it easy" kind of day, Tacoma. Get out there, but keep those lungs in mind.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Your lungs might feel a bit of extra grit today with that Moderate Air Quality Index (AQI 68) due to inhalable particulate matter. Don't push your max efforts.
*   The weather is clear and cool (7.9°C), which is usually perfect, but previous atmospheric river activity and lingering dampness mean some trails could still be soft underfoot.
*   Watch out for ongoing road maintenance in North Tacoma, especially if you stick to street running.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality: Moderate Means Moderate Effort

Look, I'm all for crushing a workout, but today isn't the day to try and set a new personal best for your 10k loop around Point Defiance Park. The AQI is sitting at a "moderate" 68, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the main culprit. That means tiny bits of crud floating around that your lungs don't particularly enjoy. While it's not "stay indoors and panic" bad, it's definitely "listen to your body and maybe scale back that sprint interval" bad.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory:** An AQI of 68 (Moderate) means sensitive groups might experience respiratory symptoms. For everyone else, prolonged exertion might lead to some discomfort. Consider an easier pace or shorter duration.
</AlertBox>

### Weather: Clear and Cool, But Don't Get Complacent

We've got clear skies and a cool 7.9°C, which sounds like prime running weather for us Pacific Northwesterners. And usually, it is. However, there's been some recent weather drama across Western Washington with an "atmospheric river" system bringing heavy precipitation through February 25th. While the deluge is over, remember that damp ground can hide slick spots, especially on less-maintained paths. So, if you're hitting those dirt trails or gravel paths, stay alert for any residual mud or loose footing.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Trail Tip:** Even with clear skies, post-rain conditions can make trails slippery. If you're heading off-pavement, especially around steeper sections of places like the Waterwalk at Foss Waterway, wear appropriate footwear and be mindful of your stride.

### Construction Zone: North Tacoma Street Runners, Take Note

If your usual routes take you through North Tacoma, be aware that the city has street closures for its Residential Street Restoration Program maintenance work. Specifically, sections of North Winnifred Street (from North 42nd to North 44th), North Bennett Street (from North 42nd to North 43rd), North Ferdinand Street (from North 27th to North 30th), and North Mullen Street (from North 25th to North 27th, and North 29th to North 30th) are projected to have ongoing work this week. This isn't some quick fix; they anticipate this lasting until mid-April. So, plan your routes accordingly or be ready for detours. Trying to weave through construction cones and machinery is not a good workout, it's just asking for trouble.

| Air Quality   | Moderate | AQI 68, dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). Limit intense or prolonged outdoor exertion.                                                                                              |
