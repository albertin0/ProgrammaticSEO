Don't let that clear sky fool you, Spokane – today's a deceptively tricky day to hit the pavement or trails without thinking twice.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Breezy and Brrr:** While the sun might be out, strong winds are expected to whip through the area, making that 4.9°C feel a lot colder and potentially kicking up dust. Bundle up or stay home.
*   **Construction Chaos:** The city's a maze of projects right now. You're going to hit detours, closures, and uneven surfaces all over, from Riverfront Park to the North Spokane Corridor. Don't assume your usual route is open.
*   **Moderate Air:** Our AQI is sitting at 74 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not terrible, but combine that with the wind stirring things up, and anyone with sensitive lungs should probably take it indoors or scale back.

Look, the weather might *look* inviting with a clear sky, but a 4.9°C day with strong winds can be brutal on exposed skin and tighten up those joints faster than you can say "Spokane Falls." That wind isn't just a nuisance; it drops the "feels like" temperature significantly, making frostbite a real concern if you're not properly layered. Plus, it can make unstable surfaces even more unpredictable. I've seen too many runners get sidelined with tweaked ankles because they underestimated a breezy, cold day.

Beyond the weather, Spokane's currently undergoing a city-wide facelift, and it's impacting runners and cyclists everywhere. For example, if your go-to is a run through **Riverfront Park**, be aware that the Snxw Meneɂ Island cultural redevelopment project is ongoing. While a full construction timeline isn't publicly known yet, expect potential impacts to pedestrian flow or access within the park. Similarly, those trying to navigate near the **North Spokane Corridor** construction will face disruptions. Carlisle Avenue between Greene and Ralph Streets is closed, and the Spokane River is shut down at the Greene Street Bridge for ongoing bridge construction. These aren't minor detours; they could add significant mileage or force you onto less safe routes.

Then there's the pervasive construction across city streets. The City of Spokane's obstruction notice for this week lists numerous lane closures and areas with flaggers on streets like Sprague Avenue, Havana Street, Francis Avenue, and the Palouse Highway. If you're running on sidewalks or along shoulders, you're constantly dodging equipment, uneven asphalt, or unexpected closures. Oh, and it's still pothole season until mid-March. Watch your step, people.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Wind Gusts & Debris:** Strong winds are a notable concern today. They can make running uncomfortable, increase the risk of hypothermia, and potentially blow debris onto roads and trails. Be extra vigilant.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Construction Zone Confusion:** Major construction on the North Spokane Corridor has resulted in closures like Carlisle Avenue and the Spokane River at the Greene Street Bridge. Don't assume you can run through; plan alternative routes.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Buttercup:** Given the chilly 4.9°C and significant wind, prioritize windproof outer layers, gloves, and a hat. Even if you heat up, the wind chill can quickly steal your body heat.

Keep an eye on your footing, stay aware of your surroundings, and don't push it if that wind makes your lungs feel like an icebox. There's always tomorrow.
