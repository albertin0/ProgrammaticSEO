If you're looking for an outdoor jaunt today, Spokane, you're gonna have to pick your battles and watch your step.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" weather might sound appealing, but with temps just barely above freezing (2.2°C, feels like 0°C), shaded spots are gonna be slick with refrozen ice. Prepare for some hidden hazards on the pavement or dirt trails.
*   The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 74, with ozone being the main culprit. If your lungs are sensitive, or you're planning a long, hard effort, you might notice it. It's not "stay indoors" bad, but it's not "breathe deep and free" good either.
*   Watch out for construction and closures. The California Creek Trail on Mica Peak is still shut down for logging until July, so don't plan your epic mountain run there. And if you're usually cruising the Centennial Trail near the Greene Street Bridge, remember that area's still a mess with the North Spokane Corridor work, including a Spokane River closure.

</BulletList>

Forget any grand plans for a PR on the Centennial Trail near the river today, especially if you're east of Downtown. The North Spokane Corridor project means the Spokane River is shut down at the Greene Street Bridge, and Carlisle Avenue in that vicinity is closed. It's a vital connection, and while the Children of the Sun Trail extension is coming, for now, you'll need to reroute. Don't be that person trying to sneak through a construction zone; it's not worth the twisted ankle or the lecture from a flagger who's just trying to keep everyone safe.

### Mind the Gusts & Blowing Debris
The National Weather Service noted gusty winds yesterday, and that lingering breeze today could pick up some dust, especially along major roadways like I-90 and US-2. If you're out on a bike, or just going for a walk, consider a pair of glasses to keep the grit out of your eyes. And for those of you with unsecured trampolines (you know who you are), maybe tie 'em down before they become airborne projectiles.

### Dress for the Freeze, Even if it's "Clear"
With temperatures hovering around freezing, even though the sun might peek out, exposed skin gets cold fast. Layer up, wear gloves, and for the love of all that is holy, choose good traction on your footwear. That thin layer of ice on unexpected surfaces is the number one way to end up in my PT clinic with a sprain or worse.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Pollen is low today, so at least your sinuses get a break. Enjoy that, because it's probably the easiest thing about your outdoor workout right now.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail Closures You Can't Ignore
Beyond the North Spokane Corridor, remember that California Creek Trail on Mica Peak is closed until July for logging. And for you Dishman Hills regulars, the Glenrose Trailhead will see weekday closures starting this month for fire fuel mitigation. Respect the signs; those crews aren't playing around.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, Spokane, just because the sun's out doesn't mean it's T-shirt weather. Stay smart, stay safe, and maybe stick to Riverfront Park if you want a guaranteed clear path, just watch out for construction traffic on nearby streets like Sprague Avenue or Havana Street.
