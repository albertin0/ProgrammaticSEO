If you're looking to hit the Spokane streets or trails today, February 26th, just remember you'll be dodging construction barrels and battling some chilly, windy air.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** An AQI of 74 with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't going to kill you, but it's not exactly sparkling mountain air either. Take it easy if your lungs are sensitive.
*   **Watch for Ice, Especially Bridges:** With temperatures hovering just above freezing (1.9°C, or about 35°F) and a chance of snow, those shaded spots and particularly bridges (like on the Centennial Trail over Latah Creek) can be treacherous with black ice, even if the main roads look clear. We've seen how fast conditions can turn nasty on I-90 in the past.
*   **Construction is Everywhere:** Seriously, it’s a minefield out there. Lane closures, detours, and even full road blocks are impacting everything from Sprague Avenue to the Spokane River. If your usual route takes you near the **Greene Street Bridge**, good luck; the Spokane River is actually closed there for the North Spokane Corridor bridge construction.

### Today's Rundown

Today's forecast is "Clear" but don't let that fool you. The mercury is barely above freezing at 1.9°C, which means that crisp, "fresh" air will feel downright frigid thanks to the expected strong winds. Yep, Spokane and the Columbia Basin are in for some gusts that could kick up dust and make visibility a real pain, especially if you're out running near the highways like US-2 or I-90. Dress for a deeper chill than the thermometer says, and eye those surfaces. If it looks even a little damp, assume it's slick.

Pollen levels are thankfully low, so at least you won't be snotting your way through your workout, which is a small victory in the grand scheme of things. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 74, with ozone being the main culprit. If you've got any respiratory issues, consider keeping that easy run *really* easy, or maybe hit the treadmill today. No need to push it when your lungs are already doing extra work.

### What to Watch Out For

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Wind Chill and Blowing Dust:** Those strong winds aren't just an annoyance; they'll make the already chilly air feel much colder. More importantly, they're flagged to create blowing dust, which is no fun for your lungs or your eyes, especially on busier routes. Consider eyewear to protect against debris.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Icy Surfaces persist:** Even with a "clear" sky, near-freezing temperatures mean any moisture on pavement or bridges can turn to black ice without warning. This is a prime condition for an ankle sprain or worse. Be hyper-vigilant, especially around dawn or dusk, on shaded paths, and any elevated structures.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Chaos Continues:** Planning a long run or bike ride? Check the City of Spokane's obstruction notices. There are multiple lane and street closures across the city. The project connecting the **Fish Lake Trail** to the Centennial Trail along Government Way, while a great idea, also means you'll be running near an active construction zone. Factor in extra time for detours and be prepared for uneven surfaces. It’s Spokane; we're always building something.
</AlertBox>

Also, a heads-up: the Washington State Department of Natural Resources announced yesterday that state budget cuts might lead to some recreational sites being closed or less maintained. While they haven't listed specific Spokane trails yet, it's a good reminder that those remote paths might not be as clear or safe as usual. Don't rely on pristine conditions out there.
