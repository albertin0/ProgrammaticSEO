Another clear, crisp Seattle day, which means you're either buzzing for a run or eyeing that coffee pot like it's the finish line of Boston.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky is doing its job, keeping pollen low and giving us a decent view, but don't let it fool you – it's still February, and it's cold enough to make your lungs question your life choices.
*   AQI is hovering in the moderate zone due to ozone, so if your respiratory system is a drama queen, keep an eye on it, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   Construction season is apparently year-round in this city, and it's messing with some of our favorite routes, making for unexpected detours and potential hazards.
</BulletList>

Look, the sun's out, which is a win in late February in Seattle, but don't get too excited. That 5.3°C temperature feels colder than it looks once you're a mile into your stride, especially with any hint of a breeze. Your lungs will be doing extra work, and those joints will take a bit longer to warm up. Give yourself a good dynamic warm-up before you hit the pavement or the dirt.

The Air Quality Index is sitting at 72 today, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. For most folks, this isn't a showstopper, but if you've got asthma or other lung sensitivities, you might feel a bit of irritation. It's not "stay indoors and panic" bad, but it's not "breathe deep and feel invigorated" good either. Just be mindful of your body's signals.

Now for the real fun: Seattle's perpetual state of construction. If you're planning on hitting the **Burke-Gilman Trail** anywhere near the areas between 77th and Inverness, be aware that while last year's repairs wrapped up, planning for 2026's work is very much underway from February 2nd through March 28th. That means potential detours, rough patches, or unexpected closures. Always scout ahead, or just assume there's a backhoe waiting to reroute your zen.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail Construction Ahead: Burke-Gilman & RapidRide J Line**
Expect active construction and potential detours on sections of the Burke-Gilman Trail. Additionally, the RapidRide J Line project is tearing up parts of the University District, Eastlake, South Lake Union, and Belltown. This means torn-up sidewalks, lane reductions, and general chaos for runners and cyclists. Keep your head up, stay aware of your surroundings, and don't assume your usual path is clear.
</AlertBox>

And it's not just the trails. If your outdoor workout involves navigating Seattle's streets, remember that the First Avenue South Bridge has two northbound lanes closed indefinitely due to deck concerns. While that's mostly a traffic headache, it could impact how you get to or from your workout spots in South Seattle.

If you're thinking of venturing further afield into the mountains for some higher-elevation activity, remember that just a couple of days ago, the Cascades had winter weather advisories for up to a foot of snow and high winds. While that advisory expired yesterday, conditions can change fast, and trail maintenance across Washington is generally reduced due to staffing issues. Be extra prepared if you're leaving the city limits.

**Dress for Success (and Survival)**
5.3°C (around 41.5°F) with clear skies can feel deceptively cold. Layer up, especially if you're starting early. A wind-resistant outer layer is your friend.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Park Closure: Seven Hills Park (Capitol Hill)**
If you were hoping to get some reps in at Seven Hills Park on Capitol Hill, it's still fenced off and closed through the end of February due to "negative park activity." Find another green space for your drills today.
</AlertBox>

Stay safe out there, Seattle. Don't be a hero, be smart.
