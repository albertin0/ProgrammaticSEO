Here's the deal: Today's a mixed bag. You *can* get out there, but you gotta be smart about where you're going and what your lungs can handle.

## Today's Grind: Mind Your Lungs and Your Route

Alright, Seattle, let's talk about hitting the streets (or what's left of them) today, February 25, 2026. It's a clear day, hovering around a mild 9.2°C (that's pushing 49°F for the imperial folks), which sounds decent enough, right? Wrong. Or at least, not entirely right.

First up, that air. The AQI is sitting at 81, which dumps us squarely into "Moderate" territory. Your dominant pollutant is Inhalable Particulate Matter (&lt;10µm). What does that mean for you? It means those tiny bits of crud floating around are small enough to get into your lungs and irritate the hell out of them. AccuWeather actually slapped a "Poor" rating on our air for today, advising sensitive groups to "Reduce time spent outside if you are feeling symptoms such as difficulty breathing or throat irritation." So, if you've got asthma, COPD, or just fancy breathing easily, maybe don't push that tempo run too hard, especially near traffic.

### Construction Chaos: Eastlake and East Marginal Way

As for your route, if you thought Seattle construction was ever *not* an issue, you clearly haven't run here long. The RapidRide J Line project is still tearing up **Eastlake Ave E**, making a mess of things in the University District, Eastlake, South Lake Union, and Belltown. Expect torn-up sidewalks, lane shifts, and general annoyance if that's part of your usual loop. You'll be dodging more than just slow walkers.

Down south, the East Marginal Way Corridor Improvement Project is supposedly "mostly complete," but don't be fooled. Railroad work is *still ongoing through early 2026*, leading to temporary closures of S Hinds St, S Horton St, and S Hanford St at E Marginal Way S through mid-March. Worse for us runners and cyclists, the bike lane on the east side between S Spokane St and S Horton St is closed, forcing you onto a shared-use path on the west side. Watch your head out there.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **AQI is Moderate (81):** For those with respiratory sensitivities or heart conditions, consider scaling back the intensity or duration of your outdoor workout today. If you're feeling anything from a tickle in your throat to actual breathing difficulty, cut it short. Nobody needs an ER trip over a PR.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Seven Hills Park Closed:** Don't bother heading to Seven Hills Park on Capitol Hill. It's fenced off and closed through at least February 26th due to "negative park activity." Find another green space that hasn't been deemed a public safety hazard.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Plan Your Route Around Construction:** Seriously, check the Seattle Department of Transportation's updates if your run takes you near Eastlake Ave E or East Marginal Way S. Detours might be longer or less safe than you think. Embrace the adventure, but don't get flattened.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Low          | N/A           |

Good news for allergy sufferers: Pollen is thankfully low today, so at least that's one less thing trying to choke you.

Stay safe out there, try not to inhale too much particulate matter, and for god's sake, look both ways before you run through a construction zone. Your physical therapist (me) thanks you.
