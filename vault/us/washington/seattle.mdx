Forget hitting your PR on the Burke-Gilman Trail today; unless you enjoy wrestling a gale, keep your workout indoors.

<BulletList>
*   **Gusty Winds Ahead:** Brace yourselves, Seattle. We're looking at powerful wind gusts between 55-70 mph ripping through the city starting today and continuing through the weekend. This isn't just a bad hair day; it's downed trees and potential power outages territory. Running in this is asking for trouble or at least a deeply unenjoyable slog.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** While the skies are clear, the Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 69, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. For those of you with sensitive lungs, consider this your heads-up. AccuWeather specifically mentions the air reaching a "high level of pollution" that's "unhealthy for sensitive groups."
*   **Construction Chaos:** Our city's always building, and that means disruptions. The RapidRide J Line construction continues its march through the University District, Eastlake, South Lake Union, and Belltown, bringing with it heavy machinery, dust, and general noise pollution.

### Today's Environmental Breakdown

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant | Temperature | Condition |
| :----------- | :---- | :----------------- | :---------- | :-------- |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Wind Warning!** Seriously, folks, these aren't your typical Puget Sound breezes. NOAA's outlook warns of wind gusts up to 70 mph in the Seattle area today. This is strong enough to snap branches, knock out power, and turn your run into an unplanned wrestling match with airborne debris. If you absolutely must go outside, stay away from wooded areas, especially if you're anywhere near the Cascades where heavy snow and wind risk is also in play.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Park Closures and Pedestrian Hazards:** Still thinking of hitting a favorite green space? Remember that **Seven Hills Park** is currently fenced off and closed through today due to ongoing "negative park activity." Also, the recent tragic pedestrian fatality at Pine and Bellevue, though unrelated to wind, is a stark reminder to be hyper-aware of your surroundings, especially with ongoing road and sidewalk construction impacting visibility and safe passage across the city.

**Indoor Options & Route Planning:** With winds like this, it's a prime day for an indoor workout. If you insist on braving the elements, choose routes away from large trees or active construction zones. For those commuting or trying to access trails further out, be aware of significant traffic disruptions in Shoreline due to construction on the North 145th Street corridor. Factor in extra time and be patient. And as always, dress in layers for the chilly 43°F clear weather.
