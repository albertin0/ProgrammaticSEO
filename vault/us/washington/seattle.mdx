Forget about hitting a new PR outside today, Seattle. The city's trying to blow us all into Elliott Bay.

<BulletList>

*   **Windy City:** We're talking serious gusts here. While the broader Puget Sound region could see winds up to 70 mph, Seattle proper is looking at 25-30 mph gusts, especially on exposed bridges and shorelines. That’s enough to send you sprawling or turn your run into an involuntary kite-flying session. Watch your step, watch your hat, and definitely watch for anything that might come flying off a construction site.
*   **Moderate AQI with a Side of Dust:** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 60, with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. With these winds whipping around, those tiny particles aren't just going to magically settle. They'll be airborne, ready for your lungs to filter, whether you like it or not.
*   **Construction Zone Ahead (and everywhere else):** It's Seattle, so of course there's construction. The RapidRide J Line project is still messing with streets, sidewalks, and bike lanes in the U District, Eastlake, and South Lake Union. East Marginal Way S also has ongoing rail construction closures. Don't expect your usual route along the Burke-Gilman Trail to be smooth sailing if you're anywhere near these zones.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Danger: High Winds!** Gusts reaching 25-30 mph in Seattle and even higher (55-70 mph) across the Puget Sound region are no joke. This isn't just a bad hair day; it's a "tree branches down, light objects flying, and unstable footing" kind of day. If you absolutely *must* be outside, stick to sheltered areas and keep an eye on anything that could become a projectile.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Caution: Construction Chaos.** Seriously, just assume there's a detour. From the RapidRide J Line work carving up neighborhoods to the rail construction on East Marginal Way S, your usual running or cycling path might be a surprise obstacle course. Plan extra time, stay alert for heavy machinery, and don't trust your GPS blindly.

**Pro-Tip: Dress for the Wind Chill.** Even though it's technically "clear" and 6.5°C, those strong winds will make it feel significantly colder. Layer up, cover exposed skin, and maybe rethink that shorts-and-a-t-shirt combo unless you're trying to win a bet.
