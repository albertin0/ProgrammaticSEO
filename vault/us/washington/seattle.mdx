Today’s a decent day for a run, but keep your eyes peeled for construction detours and don't expect mountain views from the city.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 60, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. Not terrible, but if your lungs are easily annoyed, you might notice it.
*   Don't expect every path to be pristine; budget cuts mean some state trails are getting less love, and local construction is, well, local construction.
*   Chilly temperatures and breezy conditions mean layering up is smart, even if the skies are mostly clear.

## Seattle's Outdoor Reality Check: February 26, 2026

Alright, Seattle, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the trails today. We've got clear skies and a temperature hovering around 7.2°C (that's about 45°F for you Fahrenheit folks). Sounds crisp, right? For the most part, it is. But as always, there are a few snags to navigate if you're planning on breaking a sweat outside.

First up, the air. Our Air Quality Index is at a moderate 60, primarily due to inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). What does that mean for you? If you're generally healthy, you're probably fine. But if you're one of those sensitive types – you know, with asthma, COPD, or just a generally whiny respiratory system – you might want to consider dialing back the intensity or sticking to indoor workouts. It's not "stay inside and filter your air" bad, but it's not "breathe deep and feel invigorated" good either. On the plus side, pollen levels are low, so your nose should be pretty happy.

### Know Your Trails: Closures & Construction Ahead
Several areas in and around Seattle are dealing with closures or ongoing construction that could impact your route. Don't assume your usual path is clear.
</AlertBox>

For instance, if you're near Capitol Hill, you might already know **Seven Hills Park** is still fenced off and closed to the public through today, February 26th, due to ongoing safety concerns. So, no hill repeats there, champ.

Down in SoDo, the multi-year rebuild of **E Marginal Way S** continues. While biking and walking access *will* be maintained throughout the project, expect detours and changes to the route. Specifically, railroad work means temporary closures for streets like S Hinds, S Horton, and S Hanford at E Marginal Way S through mid-March. And if you typically bike on the east side of E Marginal Way S between S Spokane St and S Horton St, that bike lane is closed, so you'll be rerouted to the shared-use path on the west side. It's a puzzle, so pay attention to signage.

Then there’s the broader issue of our state's recreational sites. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) recently announced that state budget cuts are threatening closures and reduced maintenance for many lands, including some of those beautiful **Snoqualmie area trails** we all love. While this is a statewide issue, it’s worth noting if you’re heading out for a longer, more adventurous run or hike outside the immediate city limits. Check the DNR site before you go, or be prepared for less-than-ideal trail conditions.

Up in Snohomish County, the walkway around the ballfields at Tambark Creek Park is closed today for tree removal and drainage work, although the rest of the park facilities remain open. Not directly Seattle, but close enough to mess with your plans if you commute north.

In short, it’s a perfectly acceptable day to get outside, but it requires a bit more situational awareness than usual. Stick to well-maintained paths like the Burke-Gilman if you want a guaranteed smooth ride, or if you're heading elsewhere, do a quick check on current conditions.

### Stay Hydrated and Visible
Even on clear, cool days, staying hydrated is crucial. And with shorter daylight hours, consider reflective gear and lights if your workout extends into the evening.
