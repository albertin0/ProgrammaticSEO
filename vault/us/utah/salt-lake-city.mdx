If you're looking to hit the trails today in Salt Lake City, you're going to need to be selective, or you'll be wading through mud and dodging construction cones.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air is okay, but not great, and definitely not something to push hard through if you're sensitive.
*   Many popular trails are either officially closed or a sloppy, muddy mess.
*   Mountain terrain is straight-up dangerous with considerable avalanche risk.
</BulletList>

The weather today is a mild 9.5°C and clear, which sounds inviting enough for a run. But don't let that fool you into thinking all's clear. We're in prime "mud season" territory up in the foothills, and the Salt Lake City Public Lands Department is practically begging people to stay off muddy trails to prevent further erosion and damage. If you hit the Victory Switchbacks or the BST Valleyview trail around now, you're likely to find yourself sinking, not soaring.

### Air Quality Report

| Pollutant          | Level  | Details                                                                                                          |
| :----------------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overall AQI        | 83     | Moderate/Fair. Acceptable for most, but sensitive groups may experience minor to moderate symptoms.    |
| Dominant Pollutant | NO₂    | Nitrogen dioxide. Breathing high levels increases the risk of respiratory problems.                   |
| Pollen             | Low    | No significant impact today.                                                                                     |

<AlertBox type="warning">
The Air Quality Index is currently sitting at 83, primarily due to Nitrogen dioxide. While classified as "Fair" for most, if you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, take it easy. Tomorrow and Saturday are forecast to be "Poor," so get your outdoor miles in today if you absolutely must.

### Trail Talk & Closures

Seriously, folks, the trails are a mess. A major section of the Jordan River Parkway Trail is closed between Cottonwood Park and 700 North for environmental restoration and safety improvements. Another part, from Riverside Park to Backman Elementary, is also shut down until late May due to bridge reconstruction. These aren't minor detours; they're significant chunks of popular routes.

Up in the Salt Lake City Foothills Trail System, the 18th Avenue Trailhead is a no-go zone until June 2026 because of the Public Utilities North Bench Pump Station construction. If you were planning on accessing trails from there, you'll need to use the 18th Avenue East Access instead, and be aware the Meadow Trail itself has a detour.

<AlertBox type="danger">
DO NOT go into the Salt Lake Area Mountains for backcountry activities today. The Utah Avalanche Center has the danger rated as "CONSIDERABLE" on all aspects and elevations. Human-triggered avalanches are *likely*, and yesterday saw very large natural slides. Warm temps, rain at lower elevations, and wind higher up are making conditions extremely unstable. Stay off slopes steeper than 30°. It's not worth it.
</AlertBox>

If you absolutely need to get outside, stick to known paved routes that aren't impacted by closures, or hit one of the city's amazing parks for some laps. Just use your head and assume anything beyond a well-maintained paved path is probably a bad idea right now.
