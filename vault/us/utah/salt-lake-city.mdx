Alright, Salt Lake City, let's talk about getting outside today.

Honestly, it's a bit of a mixed bag out there, so tread carefully depending on your plans.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   Our valley air is taking a turn for the worse, leaning into "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" territory.
*   Those Wasatch Mountain trails are screaming "danger," with high avalanche risk from recent storms.
*   Paved routes are looking good in terms of temperature, but mud season is still clinging on in the foothills, and construction never truly sleeps.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe

Let's get straight to it: the air quality is on the decline. While the current AQI is sitting at 84, AccuWeather is forecasting "Poor" air quality for today and Friday, particularly for sensitive groups. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, which is basically the gritty stuff that gets stuck in your lungs, especially when an inversion decides to settle in. We're known for these inversions, and they love to trap all the crap we breathe.

| Pollutant Category        | AQI Value | Level of Health Concern      |
| :------------------------ | :-------- | :--------------------------- |
| PM10 (Inhalable Particulate Matter) | 84        | Moderate / Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (forecast) |
| Ozone                     | Low       | Good                         |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  If you've got asthma, lung issues, or are just generally sensitive, you should seriously consider limiting your outdoor activities today and tomorrow. Your lungs will thank you. Maybe hit the treadmill, if you must.

## Mountain Mayhem

Thinking of escaping the valley for some high-altitude adventure? Think again. The Utah Avalanche Center has issued a *High Avalanche Danger* warning for the northern Utah mountains, including the beloved Wasatch Range, effective through 6 AM Thursday, February 26th. We've had a bunch of heavy rain and snow recently, coupled with strong winds, which has made for extremely unstable conditions. People have already died this week in avalanches, don't be next.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  Stay the hell off and out from under any slopes steeper than 30 degrees in the Wasatch Mountains. Large, natural, and human-triggered avalanches are very likely. This isn't the day to prove how "gnarly" you are.
</AlertBox>

## On the Ground

For those sticking to lower elevations, the temperature is actually quite pleasant at 7.1°C (about 45°F) and clear skies. But don't let that fool you into thinking every trail is prime.

<AlertBox type="info">
  "Mud Season" is still a very real thing in our foothills. If you're heading out to places like the lower sections of the Foothills Trail System, stick to paved paths or turn around if you encounter mud. Hiking or biking on muddy trails destroys them for everyone.
</AlertBox>

Also, ongoing construction projects are still impacting our local routes. A significant section of the Jordan River Parkway Trail around the 700 North bridge in Fairpark and Rose Park is closed until the end of May due to reconstruction. And the 18th Avenue Trailhead will be closed through June 2026 for pump station construction, with detours for the Foothills Trail System and I Street Bike Park. Plan your routes and expect detours.
