If you're heading out the door in Salt Lake City today, you're looking at a mixed bag. The air's not great, and half your usual routes are probably torn up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Moderate Air Quality is a Drag:** That AQI sitting at 81 with inhalable particulate matter means your lungs are going to work a little harder than they should, especially if you're prone to breathing issues.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Seriously, everywhere you turn there's a detour. From the Jordan River Parkway Trail to downtown streets, prepare to reroute or hit a dead end.
*   **Mild Temps, But Watch the Forecast:** It's a surprisingly mild 5.5°C and clear out *now*, which is nice for the joints, but don't get too comfortable. Light rain is on the forecast for tonight.
</BulletList>

## The Air: Breathe it, But Not Too Deeply

That AQI of 81 means we're firmly in "moderate" territory. For most of us, it's just an annoying haze, but if you've got asthma or are sensitive to PM10, today's a day to consider that indoor workout or at least shorten your outdoor stint. We're not in full-on inversion mode, but it's definitely not mountain-crisp.

## On the Ground: A Minefield of Orange Cones

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Jordan River Parkway Trail Closure
A significant chunk of the **Jordan River Parkway Trail** is still closed for bridge reconstruction. If you typically run, bike, or walk from Riverside Park to Backman Elementary, you're out of luck until at least the end of May. Detours are available, but they often throw you onto less-than-ideal roads. Plan your route accordingly, or just accept you're getting extra steps looking for a way around.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Foothills Trail System & 18th Avenue Trailhead
Don't even think about parking at the **18th Avenue Trailhead** right now; it's closed through June 2026 for pump station construction. You can still access parts of the Foothills Trail System and I Street Bike Park via the 18th Avenue East Access, but expect detours on Meadow Trail and potential parking headaches.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Downtown Dodging
If your run takes you downtown, be aware that eastbound South Temple from Main to State Street is shut down until late March for gas pipeline work. And let's not forget the ongoing 600/700 North reconstruction, which is a long-term headache for anyone trying to navigate that area. Consider Liberty Park or Memory Grove for an uninterrupted (mostly) urban run today.
</AlertBox>

Look, it's February, so we're lucky to have mild temps and clear skies (for now). Just keep those lungs in mind with the moderate AQI, and for heaven's sake, pay attention to the construction signs. There are enough orange cones out there to build a small city.
