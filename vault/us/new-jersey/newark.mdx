Forget hitting those PRs today, Newark. You're still dealing with the fallout from the Blizzard of '26, and the air isn't exactly doing your lungs any favors, even if it's "clear" outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Joint-jolting Snow & Ice:** We just got slammed. While the main roads might be cleared, you better believe the side streets, park paths, and less-traveled sidewalks are still a minefield of ice patches and stubborn snowbanks. One wrong step and your ankles will hate you.
*   **Particulate Problem:** That AQI might read "moderate" at 76, but with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) as the dominant pollutant, your lungs are still doing extra work. If you're sensitive, you'll feel it.
*   **Greenway Grind:** Good luck finding clear, uninterrupted paths near the Branch Brook Park section of the Essex-Hudson Greenway. Construction is ongoing, and while we're all looking forward to the finished product, it means detours and closures right now.

## The Lingering Blizzard Blues

So, it's 5.5 degrees Celsius and "clear." Sounds lovely, right? Wrong. The Blizzard of 2026, which dumped over two feet of snow just a few days ago, is still wreaking havoc on our running routes. That "clear" sky doesn't mean clear pavement. You're looking at icy patches lurking in the shadows, slushy crossings, and snow piled high that forces you off the curb and into traffic. Your Achilles will be screaming, and your knees will ache from the uneven surfaces. This isn't just about a chilly run; it's about actively dodging potential sprains and falls. If you're planning a long run, reconsider. Stick to shorter, well-plowed loops or hit the treadmill.

## What's In the Air?

That AQI of 76 isn't going to kill you, but it's not exactly sparkling clean, either. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), which means tiny particles are floating around. If you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity, you might notice some irritation. It's not the wildfire smoke we occasionally get, but it's enough to make a strenuous workout feel heavier than usual.

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant                  | Temperature (°C) | Condition |
| :----------- | :-- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 76  | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) | 5.5              | Clear     |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** Expect significant snow and ice accumulation on sidewalks and park trails, especially in shaded areas. Areas around Branch Brook Park, particularly near the ongoing Essex-Hudson Greenway construction, might be especially messy or impassable.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up Smart:** While it's clear, 5.5°C is still cold. Dress in layers, including a wind-resistant outer shell. Your core will thank you when you're slogging through residual snow.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Lungs First:** If you're prone to asthma or have other respiratory issues, seriously dial back the intensity today. Even "moderate" AQI with particulate matter can trigger symptoms when you're breathing hard.
