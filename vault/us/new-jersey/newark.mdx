Don't even think about pushing a hard workout outside today. Your lungs will hate you, and your joints might just rebel.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is officially "Poor" for sensitive groups, and honestly, no one needs to willingly breathe in that kind of particulate matter.</li>
  <li>While the sun's out, the ground temperature is hovering around freezing, which means every shaded patch of pavement or trail is a potential ice rink leftover from Winter Storm Hernando.</li>
  <li>Pollen's low, so at least your allergies aren't adding to the misery.</li>
</BulletList>

  ### Air Quality Alert: Don't Be a Hero
  Look, the AQI is 66, which some might call "moderate," but AccuWeather is straight-up saying it's "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups." And let's be real, fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) isn't exactly a performance enhancer. If you've got any kind of respiratory issues, or even if you just like having lungs that work, seriously consider moving that run indoors. Don't push it. Reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.

  ### Ice, Ice, Baby: Watch Your Step
  We just got hammered by Winter Storm Hernando a few days ago, remember? Even though the skies are clear now, the ground is still playing games. With temperatures hovering around freezing (0.8°C is not exactly balmy), expect black ice and slippery patches, especially in those shady spots and on less-trafficked routes. Navigating the trails in Branch Brook Park could be a risky endeavor if you're not paying attention. A slip and fall could mean a sprained ankle, a broken wrist, or worse, and trust me, PT bills are less fun than a treadmill. Public Works crews are still dealing with snow-related issues, so clear paths aren't guaranteed everywhere.

  ### Cold Weather Doesn't Mean You're Invincible
  If you absolutely *must* get outside, layer up properly. You'll warm up fast, but starting too cold is a mistake. Think wicking layers, a wind-resistant outer shell, and don't forget gloves, a hat, and good traction on your shoes. Hypothermia is no joke, even if it "feels" okay out there. And for the love of all that is holy, tell someone where you're going if you're heading out for a long one.
