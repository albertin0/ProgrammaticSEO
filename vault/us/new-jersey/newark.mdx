Alright, Newark, listen up. Today looks bright and shiny, but don't let that fool you. The city's still shaking off the brutal blizzard we just had, and while the skies are clear, the ground sure isn't.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Persistent Ice Patches:** That "Blizzard of 2026" dumped a ton of snow just a few days ago (February 22-24, remember?). Even with clear skies today, a chill in the air at -1.6°C means any melted slush from yesterday is now black ice, waiting for you in shaded spots, underpasses, and those less-traveled paths through Branch Brook Park. Your ankles will thank you for wearing spikes, or at least being extra careful.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is clocking in at 65, with Nitrogen Dioxide as our dominant pollutant. It's not a lung-buster, but it's not exactly crisp mountain air either. If you're sensitive, or you're planning an intense session, keep it in mind. You're still running in the city, folks.
*   **Ongoing Construction Chaos:** Newark is a city under perpetual construction, and that hasn't changed. The I-280 bridge deck replacement project, which was supposedly wrapping up "by the end of 2025 with final paving in spring 2026," is still a thing. Expect detours and potential hazards if your route takes you anywhere near that stretch over the NJ Transit tracks, Orange Street, and 1st Street. And don't forget the stairway closures at Military Park Station, ongoing since December.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Black Ice is a Real MF Today
Seriously, that -1.6°C isn't just a number. It means anything wet from yesterday's thaw has turned into invisible ankle-breakers. Assume every dark patch is ice. Walk like a penguin, shuffle your feet, and for the love of all that is holy, wear shoes with some grip. A twisted ankle or a busted wrist on a slick sidewalk is not the scenic workout you signed up for.

### Mind the Urban Grime
AQI of 65 isn't ideal, and Nitrogen Dioxide is nobody's friend. If you're pushing hard, you're sucking that stuff in. Consider a shorter, less intense workout, or choose routes that take you away from heavy traffic where those pollutants are most concentrated.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Layers, Layers, Layers (and a Hat)
It's cold. "Clear" doesn't mean "warm." Dress in layers you can shed, and absolutely wear a hat. You lose a surprising amount of heat from your head, and nobody needs a post-run head cold. Frostbite on exposed skin, even briefly, is a possibility, especially with any residual wind chill.
