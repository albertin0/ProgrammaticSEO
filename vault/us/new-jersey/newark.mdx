It's a mixed bag out there today, Newark. You've got clear skies, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's all smooth sailing.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lung Buster:** The Air Quality Index is creeping into "Moderate" territory, mostly thanks to inhalable particulate matter. Your lungs might feel this one if you're hitting it hard.
*   **Joint Buster:** Black ice is a very real, very sneaky threat this morning, especially on untreated surfaces. One wrong step, and your run is over, possibly with a trip to University Hospital.
*   **Temperate Chill:** The good news is the clear conditions and cool 5.4°C (41.7°F) mean you won't be sweating through multiple layers, but it's still cold enough for caution.

## Today's Rundown

Looks like the winter weather from earlier in the week is still making its presence felt, even if the sun's trying to peek through. The biggest concern for any runner, walker, or cyclist pounding the pavement, especially around spots like **Branch Brook Park**, is the reported black ice. The National Weather Service issued a Special Weather Statement this morning, warning about freezing temperatures combined with snow melt creating treacherous black ice conditions, particularly on untreated areas. I've seen enough wipeouts on lesser days to know you need to be seriously careful out there.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Watch Your Step, Seriously: Black Ice Alert!
A Special Weather Statement is active, warning of black ice. This isn't just a minor slip; it's a potential fractured wrist, ankle, or worse. Assume every wet-looking patch could be ice, especially in shaded areas or on less-trafficked paths. NJ Transit even has a bus detour on Route #1 due to icy conditions near Esther St and Euclid Ave. Seriously, walk like a penguin or stick to the treadmill.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the air. While "Clear" skies are a welcome sight, the AQI is sitting at 78, which is moderate. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), which basically means tiny crud floating around that your lungs don't appreciate. If you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity, or if you're pushing a tempo run, you're going to feel this. It's not a "stay inside and hermetically seal your house" level, but it's not pristine mountain air either.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate AQI: Lungs, Be Aware
With an AQI of 78 and inhalable particulate matter as the main culprit, those of you with asthma, bronchitis, or just a general aversion to coughing up crud after a workout should take it easy. Maybe opt for a slightly lower intensity or shorter duration today.
</AlertBox>

Finally, while not a direct "last 24 hours" hazard, there was a water main break on Springfield Avenue between Jacob Street and South 7th Street reported on February 20th. Crews are still working on repairs, which means you might encounter unexpected wet patches, detours, or general construction nuisances if your route takes you through that area. Wet roads, especially with these cold temps, are just another black ice risk factor.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Localized Wet Spots: Water Main Repairs
Keep an eye out for unexpected wet spots or detours, particularly if your usual stomping grounds include Springfield Avenue. These can turn into black ice quickly, so proceed with caution.

**Pollen Breakdown**

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Overall, the pollen count is low, so at least your sinuses won't be adding to the misery. Dress in layers, stay visible, and for the love of all that is holy, watch your footing. If you're going to Branch Brook, assume the shaded areas around the lake are slick.

*Data grounded with National Weather Service and NJ Transit from February 26, 2026.*
