Don't even think about setting any speed records outside today, Lakewood. It's a bone-chiller with hidden hazards.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Black Ice is a Menace:** Seriously, the National Weather Service and local alerts have been screaming about patchy black ice on untreated surfaces. With overnight lows dipping, that melted snow and standing water became a skating rink for your ankles.
*   **Cold Air, Moderate AQI:** At 2°C (35.6°F), your lungs are going to feel that cold air, even if the "Clear" conditions look inviting. Factor in that moderate AQI with fine particulate matter, and it's not a recipe for easy breathing.
*   **Watch for Snow Piles:** Remember that blizzard? Those snow piles aren't just scenic; they're unstable death traps, especially if plows have been at them. A kid got trapped in one just two days ago right here in Lakewood.
</BulletList>

Look, I love hitting the perimeter trail at **Ocean County Park** as much as the next runner, but today is not the day to be zoning out and hitting your stride without caution. You need to be *constantly* scanning the ground. The trails might look clear, but those shaded spots or previously damp areas are prime real estate for invisible ice.

## Today's Vitals

### Environmental Breakdown

| Metric             | Value                        |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Temperature        | 2°C (35.6°F)                 |
| Condition          | Clear                        |
| AQI                | 64 (Moderate)                |
| Dominant Pollutant | Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) |
| Pollen Level       | Low                          |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Black Ice Alert!** With temperatures dropping overnight and residual moisture from recent precipitation, untreated roads, sidewalks, and shaded sections of trails are likely to have treacherous black ice. This is an invisible killer for your joints. Assume every wet-looking patch is ice. Walk like a penguin, shuffle your feet, and seriously consider an indoor workout if you're not confident in your balance.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Cold Air & Moderate Particulates:** While the AQI of 64 isn't catastrophic, the "Fine particulate matter" combined with cold, dry air can still irritate your respiratory system, especially during strenuous activity. If you're prone to asthma or have sensitive lungs, take it easy. Wear a mask or a buff over your mouth and nose to warm the air you're breathing.
</AlertBox>

### Other Local Hazards

No major trail closures or large-scale events blocking popular running routes like the one at Ocean County Park were reported in the last 24 hours. Road construction might cause minor detours on your way to a trailhead, specifically "Overhead Utility Work" on Prospect Street and "Gas Main Installation" on Route 9 and James Street, which could mean shoulder or nighttime road closures. However, the primary concern remains the icy surfaces. There are no current flood warnings for the North Branch Metedeconk River, and wildfire risk is "Very Low".

<AlertBox type="info">
**Beware of Snow Piles:** That beautiful white stuff from the recent nor'easter? It's deceptively dangerous. Police have issued warnings about tunneling in large snow piles, as they can be unstable and collapse without warning. Stick to cleared paths and avoid tempting fate around these snow mountains.
</AlertBox>

So, if you *must* get outside, bundle up, stay visible, pick your route carefully, and for the love of your kneecaps, watch for ice. My advice? Hit the treadmill today. Your body will thank you.
