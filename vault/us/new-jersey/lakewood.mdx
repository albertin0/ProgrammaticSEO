Alright, Lakewood, you want to get out there today? Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That temperature hitting 5.8°C feels almost balmy for late February, which is great for the old knees and hips that hate the deep chill.
*   Pollen count is finally behaving, sitting at "Low," so your seasonal allergies shouldn't be making an appearance to ruin your long run.
*   However, don't breathe *too* deeply. Our Air Quality Index is creeping into "Moderate" territory at 71, with Ozone being the main culprit, so those lungs might feel it on a hard effort.
</BulletList>

Look, I know you're chomping at the bit, but let's talk real. While the air might *feel* decent and the ground *looks* clear, this time of year in Lakewood is always a mixed bag.

### Trail Closures & Urban Obstacles

If your usual route takes you through Lake Shenandoah County Park, you might need a new plan. The bridge/spillway at Lake Shenandoah is still CLOSED until further notice. That means no vehicle, bike, or foot access across it. So, for those of you planning to hit that 2-mile loop trail or just enjoy the scenery from all angles, you're out of luck. Don't try to "find a way around"; it's closed for a reason, likely a safety one, and you don't want to explain your twisted ankle to the park ranger. Find an alternate route, maybe head over to Ocean County Park and stick to their 3.1-mile perimeter trail if you're craving some off-road action.

Speaking of obstacles, if your workout involves pounding the pavement, be ready for some detours. We've got lane closures on James Street (between Williams St and Freedom Dr) for some nighttime work, and shoulder closures on Prospect Street (from Route 9 to Massachusetts Avenue) for utility work. Plus, Route 9 and James Street is seeing nighttime road closures for gas main installation. This means if you're out there early or late, expect reroutes, uneven surfaces, and confused drivers. Stay vigilant.

### Lingering Winter Grip

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch for Black Ice, Even With Warmer Temps:** Just a few days ago, we had warnings about patchy black ice forming from melting snow as temperatures dropped. While it's above freezing now, shaded areas, overpasses, and untreated sidewalks can hold onto ice patches for longer than you'd think. A 5.8°C air temperature doesn't mean the ground is magically 5.8°C everywhere. Trust me, your joints will regret an unexpected slip.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration and Ozone:** With the AQI in the moderate range due to ozone, make sure you're well-hydrated before and during your workout. Ozone can irritate your respiratory system, and being properly hydrated helps your body cope a little better. It won't magically clear the air, but every little bit helps keep you from feeling like you just ran through a smoker's lounge.
</AlertBox>

So, yeah, it's not a terrible day, but it's not a walk in the park either, especially if you *actually* planned on walking in Lake Shenandoah Park. Be smart, watch your step, and maybe keep the truly high-intensity stuff indoors if your lungs are sensitive to moderate AQI.
