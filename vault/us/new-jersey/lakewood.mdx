Listen up, Lakewood. You want to run outside today? Fine, but don't come crying to me about a sprained ankle or a wheezy cough.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  - You'll be breathing in some "moderate" air today, thanks to Nitrogen Dioxide doing its thing. If you've got sensitive lungs, you'll feel it.
  - While it'll clear up and warm to the low 50s later, those early morning temps are hovering around freezing. Your joints will protest if you don't warm them up right.
  - Patchy fog this morning, especially around places like Lake Shenandoah County Park, means visibility isn't great. And where there's early morning fog and freezing temps, there's always the ghost of black ice.

## What's Out There (Besides You)

It's February in New Jersey, people. Even with clear skies forecast for later, a "clear" day after weeks of winter still means looking out for what Mother Nature left behind.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ### Watch Your Step: Ice and Snow Lurk
  Despite today's clear forecast and rising temps, last week's snow still exists in shaded areas and along trails. You've got patchy fog this morning, and with temperatures playing around the freezing mark, black ice isn't just a possibility; it's a probability in those shaded, damp spots. Remember that poor kid who got buried in a collapsed snow igloo just four days ago here in Lakewood? Snow piles are unstable, heavy, and can hide anything from debris to ice. Stick to well-trafficked, cleared paths, and assume anything wet is actually frozen solid. Don't be a hero; take it easy on those turns. Your knees will thank you.

  ### Moderate Air Quality & Cold Start
  The AQI is clocking in at 70, with Nitrogen Dioxide as our dominant pollutant. For most of us, that's just a mild inconvenience, but if you're prone to respiratory issues, keep your easy pace truly easy. And while it's heading to the low 50s, those early hours are cold. We're talking 31 degrees Fahrenheit. Dress in layers you can shed as the day warms up, especially if you're hitting the pavement around sunrise.

<AlertBox type="info">
  ### Stay Visible and Hydrated
  Even though the fog is expected to burn off, throw on some bright colors, especially if you're out before 10 AM. Light winds means you won't get blown over, but it also means less air movement to disperse pollutants, so don't skimp on the water. And hey, if you're planning on pushing pace, consider an indoor track today. Your lungs might appreciate the break from that Nitrogen Dioxide.
