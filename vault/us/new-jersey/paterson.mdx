Today? If you *have* to get out there, bundle up and watch your step, because while the sun's out, the fallout from "Winter Storm Hernando" is still very real.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The "Blizzard of 2026" just dumped over a foot of snow on Passaic County, and while it's clearing, that means black ice and slush are your new best friends on anything but major roads.</li>
  <li>AQI is a respectable 70, but ozone is the dominant pollutant, so if you're sensitive, keep your hard efforts indoors.</li>
  <li>Construction is a constant in Paterson, and with road resurfacing contracts just authorized, expect detours and uneven surfaces.</li>
</BulletList>

### Environmental Breakdown

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant | Temperature (C) | Condition |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- | :-------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 70  | Ozone              | 5.8             | Clear     |

Look, I get it. The sun's out, the temperature is finally above freezing, hitting a balmy 5.8°C (that's about 42°F for those still in Fahrenheit land), and it feels like a good day to ditch the treadmill. But don't let the clear skies fool you into thinking it's prime running weather. Just a few days ago, "Winter Storm Hernando" absolutely walloped us, dumping over 15 inches of snow right here in Paterson, with some areas seeing a couple of feet.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Black Ice and Slick Conditions Are Everywhere.** Even with temperatures nudging above freezing, plenty of that snow and meltwater from the recent blizzard is going to refreeze overnight or in shaded areas. Main roads might be plowed, but side streets, sidewalks, and especially trails will be treacherous. Think Great Falls National Historical Park trails – picturesque, but right now, likely a death trap for your ankles. Watch for ice, especially around the paths and bridge approaches near the Falls.

The good news on the air quality front is that pollen is low. You won't be snotting your way through your run. However, our AQI is 70, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. For most folks, that's not a huge deal, but if you've got any kind of lung sensitivity, or if you're planning a high-intensity session, that ozone can still irritate your airways. It's not a "stay inside" level, but it's not exactly crisp mountain air either.

Now, let's talk about the eternal Paterson hazard: construction. The city is still trying to dig out and fix things after the storm, and beyond that, there's always something going on. We just had City Council meetings today authorizing contracts for "City Wide Road Resurfacing" on streets like Chamberlain Avenue, Burlington Avenue, and 20th Avenue. Plus, River Street's reconstruction is ongoing. This means potential unexpected detours, closed sidewalks, and uneven surfaces that are just begging to twist an ankle, especially when combined with hidden ice patches. Keep your head up, literally, and be aware of your surroundings.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Ongoing Construction and Road Work.** Roads and sidewalks, particularly around the areas mentioned for resurfacing (Chamberlain, Burlington, 20th Avenues) and River Street, will likely have uneven surfaces, debris, or unexpected closures. Don't assume your usual route is clear or safe. Be prepared to reroute or stick to very well-maintained areas.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today isn't the worst, but it's far from ideal. If you're heading out, wear trail shoes with good grip, layer up for the lingering chill, and be hyper-aware of your footing. Maybe stick to known, cleared routes, or better yet, hit the gym. Your knees will thank you.
