Look, it’s February in Paterson, so if you thought it was going to be an easy outdoor workout day, you probably haven't lived here long enough. While we might have a brief moment of "clear" skies, don't let that fool you into thinking it's balmy out. This morning is a frosty one, and yesterday’s mess left its mark.

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   **Black Ice is a Real Threat:** After yesterday's mix of snow and rain and overnight temperatures well below freezing, untreated surfaces are a minefield of black ice. Seriously, watch your step unless you enjoy a good fall.
*   **Chilly Air & Moderate AQI:** At just above freezing, the air is cold enough to make your lungs protest, especially with a moderate AQI where fine particulate matter is the dominant pollutant. It’s not a full-on health advisory, but it’s not ideal either.
*   **Persistent Trail & Road Hazards:** Don't expect smooth sailing on all your usual routes. We've got lingering snow and ice causing closures in parks, and construction always seems to be a feature of our fair city.

## Local Hazards You Need to Know About

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Ice, Seriously
While the immediate morning might be clear, yesterday saw snow and rain, and overnight temps dipped enough to create treacherous black ice, especially on shaded paths and bridges. The forecast for today also includes a 20% chance of more snow. Tread carefully, especially around areas like the paths leading to the Great Falls National Historical Park.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail and Bridge Closures
If your routine takes you to the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park, be aware that the walking bridge is currently closed due to ongoing construction. Furthermore, some areas of Overlook Park are still shut down because of snow and icy conditions. Up at Garret Mountain Reservation, the trail between Lambert Castle and Lambert Tower remains indefinitely closed. Plan alternate routes or be ready to turn back. Ignoring these could lead to a nasty spill or getting stuck.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Dress for the Freeze, Not the Fleeting Sunshine
Even with a momentary break in the clouds, 0.7°C is cold. Layers are your friend. Think wicking base layers, an insulating mid-layer, and a windproof/water-resistant outer shell. Don't forget gloves, a hat, and good traction on your shoes. Exposed skin will get cold fast.
</AlertBox>

Also, keep an eye on traffic if your route takes you near River Street. They’re still working on reconstruction, which means temporary lane closures and potential traffic delays. It's an ongoing project, so expect disruptions there until summer.
