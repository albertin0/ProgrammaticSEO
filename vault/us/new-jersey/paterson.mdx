Alright, Paterson, it's February 28th, and if you're thinking of hitting the pavement or trails, today is a day that demands caution, not recklessness.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Bone-Chilling Cold:** At -2°C (28°F) and clear, exposed skin is asking for trouble. Layer up like you're an onion, or stay inside.
*   **Sneaky Ice Patches:** We've had some significant snow and ice recently. Even with clear skies now, any melted snow could have refrozen overnight, especially on shaded stretches of the Passaic River Greenway or around the Great Falls National Historical Park. Black ice is a real ankle-breaker.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** With an AQI of 60 and fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, your lungs are working a little harder than usual. It's not a red-alert day, but it's not pristine mountain air either.

## Today's Vitals

The good news for the allergy-prone is that pollen is pretty much a non-issue.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Ragweed     | Low   |

## On the Ground in Paterson

While the air is relatively free of seasonal allergens, the low temperature is the real boss today. This isn't just "brisk," folks. This is "your-nose-hairs-will-freeze" cold. If you're planning a run or walk, especially near the Passaic, remember that colder air can feel harsher on your lungs, and those fine particulates aren't helping.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch Your Step: Residual Ice Hazard!
Despite the "clear" conditions, temperatures are still well below freezing. Keep an eye out for black ice, particularly in shaded areas, underpasses, or where snowmelt might have pooled and refrozen. This is especially true on trails around Garret Mountain Reservation or any unpaved paths where drainage isn't perfect. We've seen heavy snow and icy roads in the past week, and that stuff lingers.

Good news for history buffs and those looking for a landmark stroll: Lambert Castle is re-opening today after extensive restoration. Expect increased foot traffic and possibly some lingering project activity around that area. You've also got a "Paterson Underground Railroad & Historic Marker Trail" program happening at the Lambert Castle Carriage House this afternoon, which means more people will be out and about.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Local Events & Foot Traffic
If your route takes you near Lambert Castle or the Great Falls area today, be aware of increased pedestrian activity due to events like the re-opening of Lambert Castle and a planned historic walking tour. This means being more vigilant for sudden stops or detours.

Finally, keep an eye out for roadwork. The city council was just discussing road resurfacing projects for Chamberlain Avenue, Burlington Avenue, and 20th Avenue a couple of days ago. While not directly a "workout hazard" in terms of air quality, construction can mean unexpected detours, uneven surfaces, and increased vehicle traffic in those areas.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Road Construction Ahead
Ongoing road resurfacing and general construction activities were on the city's agenda recently. Be prepared for potential sidewalk closures, uneven surfaces, and increased construction vehicle traffic on city streets. Stay alert and consider alternative routes if you encounter active work zones.
