Alright, Chandler, let's talk about hitting the pavement or trails today. It's a bit of a mixed bag, so don't just blindly follow the pretty skies.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Air's a bit thicker than ideal:** While it's not a full-blown dust storm, the AQI is nudging into "moderate," primarily due to inhalable particulate matter. AccuWeather even calls it "poor" for sensitive groups, so your lungs might feel it more than usual.
*   **Construction Chaos is Real:** If your route involves Chandler Boulevard or any freeway access, prepare for detours. There's significant emergency sewer repair on Chandler Blvd closing Delaware Street, and a two-week ramp closure on Loop 101 to eastbound Loop 202.
*   **Perfect Running Weather:** Seriously, 71 degrees and clear? That's what we live for here. Plus, the pollen count is mercifully low, so no sneezing fits interrupting your cadence.
</BulletList>

### Keep an Eye on That Air

Look, the temperature is fantastic for getting outside, but let's not pretend our air is always pristine. With an AQI of 64 and PM10 as the main culprit, anyone with respiratory issues, young kids, or the elderly should seriously consider keeping their outdoor time lighter or opting for an indoor session. This stuff clogs lungs, and while it's not an "alert" day, it's certainly not "fresh mountain air" either. The City of Chandler itself advises against activities that kick up dust on pollution advisory days. Think about it.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality Alert:** Our current AQI is 64, with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) being the dominant pollutant. This means sensitive groups (anyone with asthma, kids, seniors) should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. It's not terrible, but it's not great. Your lungs deserve better.

### Construction Zone Navigation

If you're a runner or cyclist who uses the major arteries or tries to get on the freeway, you're going to hit some snags. There's an emergency sewer repair shutting down Delaware Street at Chandler Boulevard, and traffic is restricted on Chandler Boulevard between Arizona Avenue and Hamilton Street. They've opened one lane in each direction, but it's still a mess.

Even bigger, the southbound Loop 101 (Price Freeway) ramp to eastbound Loop 202 (Santan Freeway) is in the middle of a two-week closure for pavement work. If your route involves getting onto that freeway from the 101, plan for significant detours. ADOT recommends using Price Road or Chandler Boulevard to Dobson Road as alternatives.

And for those who like the multi-use paths, watch out around the **Paseo Trail** and Frye Road area. There's ongoing construction for protected bike lanes on Frye Road from the Paseo Trail to San Marcos Elementary, with anticipated completion in Fall 2026. That means unexpected closures or detours could pop up. Don't be that person surprised by a "Road Closed" sign in the middle of your long run.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Major Road/Ramp Closure Impacting Traffic & Routes:** The southbound Loop 101 ramp to eastbound Loop 202 is closed for approximately two weeks. Plan alternative routes if you typically use this area for cycling or driving to your workout spot. Additionally, an emergency sewer repair has Delaware Street closed at Chandler Boulevard.

**Hydrate, Even in Cooler Weather:** Just because it's a pleasant 71°F doesn't mean you can skimp on water. This is still Arizona, folks. Keep that hydration up, especially if you're pushing distance or intensity.
