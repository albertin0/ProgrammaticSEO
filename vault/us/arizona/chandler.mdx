Alright, Chandler, time to talk turkey. Today's a mixed bag for hitting the pavement or trails, mostly because someone forgot to tell the sun it’s still February.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Your lungs are going to love you today with crystal clear skies and no nasty pollen trying to kill you.
*   However, your joints (and everything else) are going to feel like it’s May, so hydrate early and often.
*   Construction and a big local event mean you might need to adjust your usual routes.
</BulletList>

Look, the air quality is fantastic, sitting pretty at an AQI of 49. That "inhalable particulate matter" is barely a blip. Plus, pollen is officially "Low", so all you seasonal allergy sufferers can breathe easy – literally. That's a rare gift in Arizona, so enjoy it while it lasts before spring kicks into full sneeze.

But don't let the clear skies fool you into thinking it's pleasant out there. We're looking at a scorching 26.8°C (that's about 80.2°F). In February! Unless you're chasing that "primal heat training" vibe, you need to be smart. This isn't just "warm," it's "might-as-well-be-summer-at-noon" hot. Go early, go late, or get on the treadmill where the AC actually works. Your PT is telling you this: pushing 80 degrees means a higher heart rate at lower effort, more sweat, and a faster trip to bonk-town. Don't be that person wheeled off the Paseo Trail looking like a sun-dried tomato.

## Local Hazards & Roadblocks

Speaking of actual roadblocks, don't plan on a smooth sail everywhere.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Chandler Boulevard & Delaware Street Shutdown

Heads up if your route takes you anywhere near Downtown Chandler. There's an ongoing *emergency sewer repair* restricting traffic on **Chandler Boulevard** between Arizona Avenue and Hamilton Street. And get this: Delaware Street is completely shut down on both sides of Chandler Boulevard. This started earlier in the week and an update is due *tomorrow*, so assume it's still a mess today. If you're running that way, plan a significant detour or be prepared to navigate some annoyed drivers.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Loop 101/202 Ramp Closure

If you typically run near the freeway interchanges, know that the southbound Loop 101 (Price Freeway) ramp to eastbound Loop 202 (Santan Freeway) is in its second week of a two-week closure. While this mainly impacts vehicles, it means more traffic on surface streets and potentially less awareness from drivers looking for detours. Keep your head on a swivel if you're anywhere near those major arteries like Chandler Boulevard or Dobson Road, as these are listed as alternative routes for drivers.

### Chandler Fun Run Today!

Today, February 26th, is also the annual **Chandler Fun Run**. This is a fantastic, non-competitive one-mile event for students with developmental disabilities, often creating a carnival-like atmosphere. While the specific location isn't always widely publicized for traffic, these events typically occur in major parks. If you're planning a run around **Tumbleweed Park**, be aware there will likely be increased pedestrian traffic and possibly some localized detours or crowds, especially during the middle of the day. Embrace the good vibes, but keep an eye out for excited kids and their families.
</AlertBox>

So, great day for your lungs, not so much for your body if you ignore that thermometer. Hydrate, pick your routes wisely to avoid construction and crowds, and for the love of all that is holy, don't try to PR your long run when it's 80 degrees in February. Your knees will thank me, and your ego can take a backseat for a day.
