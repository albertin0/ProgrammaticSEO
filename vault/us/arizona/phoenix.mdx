Alright, Phoenix, let's talk about hitting the trails today.

Today is not the day to expect a comfortable, breezy desert run; it's a "treadmill inside with the AC blasting" kind of day if you're smart.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
*   **Unseasonable Heat Spike:** We're staring down afternoon highs pushing into the upper 80s, possibly even touching the low 90s, which is wild for late February. This isn't your grandma's winter run; it's practically summer's appetizer. Expect "Minor HeatRisk" across the lower deserts.
*   **Particulate Matter Punch:** While the overall AQI might look "moderate" at 59, the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (PM10), and some local monitors are showing PM10 levels hitting an "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" AQI of 100. Your lungs are going to feel that gritty desert air, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   **Construction Chaos Kicking Off:** Major roadway construction is starting *today*, February 25, 2026, on **Northern Parkway** between Agua Fria River and 103rd Avenue. This isn't just a minor lane closure; it's a year-long project that will involve lane shifts and restrictions for both drivers and pedestrians. You thought your morning run was peaceful? Think again.

### Weather & Air Quality Breakdown

| Metric                    | Level/Value                     | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Temperature**           | 29.7°C (85.5°F), Clear          | Well above normal for February. Forecasted to climb into the mid-80s to mid-90s Fahrenheit.                                                                                                                       |
| **Pollen**                | Low                             | One less thing to worry about.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **AQI (Overall)**         | 59 (Moderate)                   | Acceptable for most, but not for everyone.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Dominant Pollutant**    | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) | Specific PM10 readings are hitting "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" levels (AQI 100) in some areas, so don't let the overall AQI fool you.                                                               |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Hydration is NOT a Suggestion, It's Survival:** With temps creeping towards the 90s, especially with that clear sky, you're going to dehydrate faster than a politician's promise. Drink *before*, *during*, and *after* your workout. Don't be that person needing a mountain rescue because you thought a single water bottle was enough for a South Mountain ascent.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Northern Parkway is a No-Go Zone (for pleasant runs):** If your route involves Northern Avenue between the Agua Fria River and 103rd Avenue, change it. Construction starts *today* and will be a mess for the next year. Expect heavy equipment, uneven surfaces, and pissed-off drivers. Not exactly ideal for hitting your stride.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Camelback's Echo Canyon Trail is STILL CLOSED:** For those hoping to tackle Echo Canyon at Camelback Mountain, don't bother. That trail remains closed indefinitely due to unstable boulders from prior storms. Stick to Cholla Trail if you're determined to bag Camelback, but remember the heat rules apply to all trails. The city *will* close trails if we hit an "Excessive Heat Warning," so keep an eye on forecasts if you plan outdoor exertion in the coming days.
</AlertBox>

Look, Phoenix in late February usually offers some prime running weather. Not today. Today is about managing the unseasonable heat and being mindful of what you're breathing. Keep your morning workouts short, stay low on the elevation, and for the love of all that is holy, hydrate.
