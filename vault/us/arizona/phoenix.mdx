Alright, Phoenix, it’s not a *bad* day to get out there, but let's not pretend it's perfect. That mercury is on the rise, and your lungs might feel it if you push too hard.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   Temperatures are already hitting a comfortable 23°C (73°F) this morning, but forecasts show us pushing into the mid-to-high 80s and even low 90s by afternoon, which is "well above normal" for late February. The National Weather Service is calling it "Minor HeatRisk" for the lower deserts.
*   Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 68, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. While not terrible for everyone, sensitive groups might feel some throat irritation or difficulty breathing with prolonged exposure.
*   The ever-popular Echo Canyon Trail at Camelback Mountain? Still shut down. Don't even think about it.
</BulletList>

Look, I love running the Valley as much as anyone, but sometimes you gotta be smart about it. Today's one of those days where you can definitely get your miles in, but you need to pay attention to your body. That "Minor HeatRisk" means it's not summer death-trap hot *yet*, but it's a good reminder that things are warming up fast here. We're already seeing highs flirting with what we'd expect later in the spring.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Hydration is not a suggestion, it's a rule.
With temperatures climbing and that dry desert air, you'll dehydrate faster than you think. Carry more water than you believe you'll need, especially if you're hitting any inclines around South Mountain Park or Papago. Remember, by the time you feel thirsty, you're already behind.
</AlertBox>

And that AQI? Sixty-eight isn't disastrous, but it's enough particulate matter to tickle your airways if you're prone to it. If you've got asthma or are just generally more sensitive, maybe keep your intense efforts to a minimum or stick to indoor workouts today. You don't want to be coughing up a lung after a tempo run along the Grand Canalscape.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Seriously, Echo Canyon is CLOSED.
I know, I know. You want to bag that peak. But the Echo Canyon Trail at Camelback Mountain has unstable boulders from recent storms and is closed until further notice for good reason. Don't be that person requiring a rescue. Head to Cholla Trail if you must summit Camelback, or explore Piestewa Peak, which is currently open and has plenty of challenging routes.
</AlertBox>

If you're going out, consider sticking to the early morning hours or waiting until after sunset. The heat is going to peak in the afternoon, and while 80-90 degrees isn't "extreme heat warning" territory *yet*, it's warm enough to cause problems if you're not acclimatized or pushing it hard.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Plan your escape route.
Even on a "mild" Phoenix day, things can go sideways. Tell someone where you're going and when you expect to be back. Carry your phone. Don't be a hero out there; be a smart runner.
