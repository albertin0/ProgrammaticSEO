If you're heading out for a run today, prepare for a seriously warm one, despite what your morning thermometer might be whispering.

*   **Heat Advisory:** Don't let the pleasant morning fool you. Today's forecast is for "well above normal temperatures," with some lower desert areas hitting the "middle 80s to upper 90s," triggering a "Minor HeatRisk" for the weekend. Phoenix Fire is explicitly warning hikers about "record-setting heat expected."
*   **Clear Skies & Clean Air:** Good news for your lungs! Air quality is in the "Good" range with an AQI of 40, and pollen levels are low. [source: environmental data] No wildfire smoke is significantly impacting the immediate Phoenix area.
*   **Urban Obstacles:** The Melrose Street Fair is shutting down a significant stretch of 7th Avenue from Indian School Road to Camelback Road today, so your usual urban loop might be a no-go or seriously detoured.

## Today's Outlook: Sweat It Out, But Smart

Alright, Phoenix, let's talk about Friday, February 28, 2026. The environmental data says it's clear and a comfortable 21.4°C (about 70.5°F) right now. That sounds peachy, right? Wrong. The weather folks are calling for "First Alert Weather Days" all weekend due to "record-setting temperatures," with highs expected to soar into the "middle 80s to upper 90s" across the lower deserts. That’s not just warm; that’s "Minor HeatRisk" territory, and if you've been around here for more than five minutes, you know what that means for outdoor activity.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**DANGER: Extreme Heat Risk on the Trails!** Despite the morning chill, temperatures are set to climb dramatically. Phoenix Fire is warning hikers about the "record-setting heat." Popular trails like those on Camelback Mountain are subject to closure under the city's Heat Safety Program if temperatures hit certain thresholds. Even if not officially closed *yet*, consider moving your mountain adventures to first thing in the morning or opting for indoor workouts.

On the flip side, your lungs are getting a break. Air Quality Index (AQI) is a low 40, meaning the air is pretty darn good, and pollen counts are low across the board. [source: environmental data] So, no wheezing from allergies or dodging a dust storm today, which is a rare win.

### Hitting the Pavement? Watch Your Route.

If you're planning an urban run, be aware that the annual Melrose Street Fair is taking over 7th Avenue between Indian School Road and Camelback Road today. This isn't some tiny block party; it's a half-mile stretch packed with vendors and people. Trying to weave through that mess for your tempo run is a bad idea for everyone involved. Plan an alternate route or hit one of the many great green belts like the Arizona Canal Path further out.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Caution: Urban Road Closures!** The Melrose Street Fair on 7th Avenue will significantly impact traffic and pedestrian routes in that area. Also, expect minor disruptions from ongoing utility work, like a partial closure on 10th Avenue between Jefferson Street and Adams Street today.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today's a mixed bag. Stellar air quality and low pollen are fantastic, but that forecasted heat is a real buzzkill for any serious outdoor grind. If you insist on hitting the trails, do it before the sun really gets cooking, bring more water than you think you need, and for the love of all that is holy, tell someone where you're going. Don't be another statistic for our already overworked Phoenix Fire Department.
