Today in Phoenix, you can absolutely get outside, but you'd be a fool not to treat it like a late May day.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Unseasonably Hot:** Forget February, we're looking at summer-like temps today. Expect highs in the mid-to-upper 80s, possibly pushing near 90°F. The record for February (92°F in 1986) is definitely in play.
*   **Air Quality is Holding, Barely:** While the current AQI sits at a respectable 45, forecasts show PM10 and Ozone nudging into the moderate range throughout the day. This is due to a mix of industrial operations and that rising heat, which helps mix local pollutants.
*   **Pollen is Your Friend:** Good news for the sniffle squad, pollen levels are low today.

Look, I get it. We just had a perfect stretch, and now the thermostat decided to pull a fast one. It's only February 26th, and we're staring down the barrel of possible record-breaking heat. If you're planning a run or hike, especially up Camelback or through Papago Park, do yourself a favor and get out there early. Seriously, *early*. They tell us to be off the trails by 10 AM in the summer, and frankly, today feels a lot like summer. The most dangerous heat window is between 2 PM and 5 PM. Hydration isn't a suggestion, it's a survival strategy.

### Extreme Heat Warning: It's February, But Dress Like July
With temperatures soaring into the high 80s and even low 90s, dehydration and heat exhaustion are real threats. The UV index is a five, so slather on that sunscreen unless you want to look like a tourist who fell asleep at the pool. Carry more water than you think you need, especially if you're hitting the trails.

On the air quality front, we're generally in the clear, but keep an eye out if you're sensitive. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, which isn't ideal, but it's not "don't breathe" bad. Warmer temps often help disperse some of the gunk, but industrial activity in the south and southwest parts of the Valley means there's always *something* floating around.

### Construction Zone Ahead: Northern Parkway is a Mess
If your route takes you anywhere near Northern Parkway between the Agua Fria River and 103rd Avenue, expect detours and slowdowns. Construction started yesterday and will be ongoing for roughly a year, weekdays from 7 AM to 4 PM. They're building new sidewalks and making improvements, which is great for the future, but a pain for your present run. Plan alternate routes or stick to residential streets to avoid the dust and heavy equipment.

### Pro Tip: Ditch the Noon Run
Seriously. Your lungs and joints will thank you. With the heat cranking up, an evening workout after the sun dips a bit is a much safer bet than trying to conquer the midday sun. And remember, don't be that person who needs a mountain rescue because you underestimated February in Phoenix.
