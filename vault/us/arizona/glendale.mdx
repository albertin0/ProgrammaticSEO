Alright, Glendale, look, today's not the worst day to get out there, but it's not exactly prime running weather either.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **AQI's flirting with "unhealthy for sensitive groups" territory.** You're pushing into "moderate" with those inhalable particulates, so don't be a hero if your lungs are feeling it.
*   **It's gonna feel hotter than it is.** The actual temperature is sitting around a pleasant 80°F (27°C), but the heat index is hovering closer to 88°F. That's a sneaky way to dehydrate yourself if you're not careful.
*   **Road work on Loop 101 is still a cluster.** Expect detours and closures that'll mess with your usual routes, especially if you're running or cycling near the Agua Fria.

### Air Quality Report

Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a **Moderate 54** today. While that sounds okay, the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (that's PM10, or PM2.5 depending on who you ask), which means those tiny bits floating around can irritate your respiratory system, especially if you're in a sensitive group. Unusually sensitive people should seriously consider dialing back that prolonged outdoor exertion.

#### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Trees       | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Weeds       | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are mercifully low today. No snot rockets ruining your stride, at least not from nature.

### Weather Watch

It's clear out there, but don't let the blue skies fool you. With the temperature at 26.9°C (around 80°F) and the heat index nearing 88°F, your body's going to be working harder than the thermometer suggests. Phoenix is even expecting its first 90-degree day today, and we're right next door, so hydrate like your life depends on it – because, honestly, it kinda does.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Stay Hydrated, People!** The heat index is up there, even if the thermometer isn't screaming "danger." Carry water, drink regularly, and don't push it too hard during peak sun hours.

### Local Hazards & Updates

If your route takes you anywhere near the **Loop 101 Agua Fria Freeway** in the West Valley, prepare for some navigational gymnastics. ADOT's got ongoing widening projects, and that means closures. Tonight, Thursday, February 26th, through tomorrow morning, the westbound Loop 101 on-ramp at 35th Avenue will be closed. And heads up for Friday and Saturday: North- and southbound 75th Avenue will be shut down between Aspera Boulevard and just south of Loop 101. That's a big chunk of road if you're trying to get around or through that area. Also, the eastbound and westbound left lanes on Union Hills between 70th and 67th Avenues are closed *today* for landscaping work, so watch for that if you're doing your laps there.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Reroute Ahead:** Planning a long run or ride near the 101? Check the ADOT and City of Glendale's transportation updates *before* you head out. Your usual path might be a concrete jungle right now.

No major trail-blocking events or wildfires reported directly impacting Glendale's trails like Thunderbird Conservation Park today. The Folk & Heritage Festival at Sahuaro Ranch Historic Park starts Saturday, so you've got a couple of days before that might affect local park access.
