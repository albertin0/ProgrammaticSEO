Alright, Tempe. If you're planning on getting after it today, you better like detours and a good sweat.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The Extra Innings Festival has swallowed up your usual waterfront routes, so adjust your expectations for Tempe Town Lake.</li>
  <li>Don't even think about a smooth ride or stroll along parts of the Tempe Canal; construction is still a thing.</li>
  <li>While the pollen count is low, the air's got some particulate matter, and the mercury is climbing higher than you'd expect for late February.</li>

## Today's Tempe Trail Traps & Sweat Sesh Strategy

Look, I'm all for consistency, but sometimes the city conspires against your routine. Today's one of those days, especially if your go-to involves the scenic routes around Tempe Town Lake. The "Extra Innings Festival" is in full swing, meaning Tempe Beach Park, Tempe Arts Park, and Neil G. Giuliano Park are all off-limits until March 5th. More importantly for us movers, the multi-use path on the *southern side* of Tempe Town Lake is shut down from February 16th to March 2nd. If you were planning a long run or ride along there, consider yourself rerouted. You can still use Rio Salado Parkway, but it's not quite the same vibe, is it?

  **Major Trail & Park Closures:** The Extra Innings Festival has shut down the multi-use path on the southern side of Tempe Town Lake, along with Tempe Beach Park, Tempe Arts Park, and Neil G. Giuliano Park. Expect significant detours around this area.

And it's not just the festival throwing a wrench in your plans. That never-ending Broadway Bridges replacement project over the Tempe Canal means the bike and pedestrian paths between Apache Road and Southern Avenue are still a no-go until April 2026. So, if your ride typically takes you along that stretch, you'll need another plan. This isn't breaking news, but a good reminder that your usual routes might still be impacted by long-term construction.

On the weather front, the given 20°C (68°F) sounds manageable, but don't be fooled. Forecasters are calling for "well above normal temperatures" for the region, with afternoon highs possibly hitting the "middle 80s to upper 90s" across the lower deserts, resulting in a "Minor HeatRisk." Yeah, in February. Tempe's going to be toasty. Hydrate like your life depends on it, because, well, it kind of does out here. The AQI is sitting at a moderate 52, primarily due to inhalable particulate matter. So, while you won't be choking on dust storms, if your lungs are sensitive, you might feel it. At least pollen is low today, so no need for the antihistamines, I guess.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Unexpected Heat:** Despite being February, expect "well above normal temperatures" today, with highs possibly reaching the 80s and even 90s Fahrenheit in the lower deserts, carrying a "Minor HeatRisk." Hydrate relentlessly and plan your workout for early morning or late evening.

For those looking for an alternative, Hayden Butte Preserve (aka "A" Mountain) is always an option for a good stair workout or a quick hike, with hours from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Just remember, no bikes on those trails, folks. It's a preserve, not a bike park.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Pro-Tip for Warm Weather Workouts:** When it's unexpectedly hot, stick to shaded routes if possible. Consider short, intense bursts rather than long, sustained efforts, and always carry more water than you think you'll need. Listen to your body – it's not trying to win a prize today, just survive.

So, you can still get out there, but be prepared for some reroutes and to sweat more than you'd like.
