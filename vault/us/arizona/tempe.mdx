Alright, Tempe, let's talk about hitting the trails today. Honestly, it's a mixed bag, mostly thanks to that festival taking over half the city's prime running real estate.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are creeping up, heading into the low 80s, which is warm for February and means you'll be baking if you're not out early.
*   Air quality is moderate with those pesky particulates floating around, so your lungs might feel it, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   Significant multi-use path closures around Tempe Town Lake are going to seriously reroute your usual long run.
</BulletList>

### Environmental Breakdown

| Factor           | Status    | Details                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pollen**       | Low       | Good news for allergy sufferers, at least.                                    |
| **Air Quality**  | Moderate  | AQI 59, dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). |
| **Temperature**  | 27.9°C / 82°F | Clear skies, but "well above normal temperatures" expected.         |

### The Innings Festival Has Taken Over

If your usual route involves the scenic paths around Tempe Town Lake, get ready for a detour. The *Innings Festival* has completely swallowed the multi-use path on the southern side of Tempe Town Lake, shutting it down from February 16 through March 2. That means no cruising past the water, no enjoying the park amenities. You're stuck on Rio Salado Parkway if you want to stay in the general area, sharing space with traffic that's not always thrilled to see you. Tempe Beach Park, Tempe Arts Park, and Neil G. Giuliano Park are also totally off-limits until March 5. Seriously, plan ahead or you'll be doing a lot of frustrated backtracking.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**MAJOR TRAIL CLOSURES:** The entire multi-use path on the *southern side of Tempe Town Lake* is closed until March 2, forcing detours onto Rio Salado Parkway. Tempe Beach Park, Tempe Arts Park, and Neil G. Giuliano Park are also closed until March 5. Plan your routes accordingly to avoid getting stuck or having to run on less safe roads.
</AlertBox>

### Heat's On (Again)

It's February, and we're already talking about heat. The National Weather Service is calling for "well above normal temperatures" today, with a "Minor HeatRisk" across the lower deserts. While 82°F isn't our summer hell, it's hot enough to make your midday run feel like a death march if you're not hydrating properly. Tempe has even been proactive in adopting new heat safety standards for outdoor workers after a brutal 2024, so you should probably take a hint and protect yourself too.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**HIGH TEMPS & HEAT RISK:** Afternoon highs will be in the low 80s, feeling warmer than it looks. This brings a "Minor HeatRisk." Hydrate, wear light clothing, and consider moving your workout to earlier in the morning or later in the evening. Don't push it in the mid-afternoon sun.
</AlertBox>

### Moderate Air, Moderate Caution

The AQI at 59 means our air is just "moderate" today, with inhalable particulate matter being the main culprit. For most of you, this probably won't be a huge deal, but if you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, you might notice it during a tough workout. It's not a "stay inside" day, but maybe don't go trying to set any PRs on "A" Mountain.

<AlertBox type="info">
**PARTICULATE MATTER:** With a moderate AQI due to inhalable particulates, sensitive groups should be mindful. If you feel any irritation, cut your workout short.
</AlertBox>

### Construction Zone

Beyond the festival, general construction continues its slow, grinding march across Tempe. While the Mill Avenue Refresh Project is "near completion" in some sections, don't be surprised by ongoing work, noise, and rerouted pedestrian paths, especially around the Downtown area. Always keep an eye out for unexpected barriers or uneven surfaces.

In short, today requires a bit more planning and a healthy dose of self-preservation. Don't say I didn't warn you.
