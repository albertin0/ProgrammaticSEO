If you're looking to hit the streets or trails in Tempe today, you're mostly in the clear, but don't let that pleasant weather make you complacent.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are gorgeous, and pollen is doing its usual disappearing act for now. Enjoy it while it lasts, because we all know what's coming.
*   Air quality is officially "moderate" with some particulate matter floating around, which means if your lungs are finicky, you might feel it. Don't push it.
*   Construction around downtown and a major festival will make some areas a total headache. Plan your route or prepare for detours.

| **Pollen**         | Low           | Allergies shouldn't be much of an issue for your outdoor excursions today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Air Quality**    | AQI 73        | This is officially "Moderate," with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant [cite: user data]. For most folks, it's fine. But if you're in a sensitive group – asthmatic, elderly, or you just generally don't enjoy inhaling tiny crud – you might experience some irritation. AccuWeather even calls today's AQI "Poor" for Tempe, so be aware. |
| **Weather**        | 22°C (72°F)   | It's a clear, beautiful day. Temperatures are expected to climb to a balmy 32°C (89°F) later on. Perfect running weather if you ask me, but remember to hydrate. It's still Arizona.                                                                                                    |

### Local Hazards to Watch For

Alright, Tempe runners, listen up. While the sky's blue and the pollen count is low, we still have some very *local* annoyances and outright dangers to contend with.

First off, downtown Tempe is still a construction zone playground. The "Downtown Tempe Refresh Project" continues to revamp Mill Avenue, and while some major road closures are reportedly on pause until mid-May, you're still going to find plenty of ongoing work around the area. Plus, you've got the massive Astria Tempe residential tower going up, which means heavy equipment and adjusted pedestrian paths are part of the landscape. If you're hitting the path near Tempe Town Lake, keep an eye out; new complexes like "250 RIO" are in the pipeline, which means more disruptions are always brewing.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Chaos:** Expect ongoing construction activity and potential detours, especially around Mill Avenue and the areas surrounding Tempe Town Lake, including the Kiwanis Park Playground renovation and 8th Street Multi-Use Path projects. Always stay aware of your surroundings and any temporary signage.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the **Extra Innings Festival**. Yes, today, February 26th, is the start of it, running through Saturday. This means significant street restrictions and closures are absolutely happening. Don't assume your usual route near the park or downtown will be open. Your best bet is to check the City of Tempe's event pages or az511.gov before you head out, or just avoid the area entirely if you don't want to get caught in event traffic and detours.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Event Alert: Extra Innings Festival:** The festival is happening today through Saturday, February 28th. Expect road closures and increased congestion, particularly around Tempe Beach Park and downtown. Check local traffic resources before planning your run.
</AlertBox>

Finally, let's talk about basic safety. The valley can be a dangerous place for runners and cyclists. Just earlier this month, a former ASU triathlete, Hannah Henry, was tragically killed in a hit-and-run in south Phoenix, with a ghost bike later placed near Tempe Town Lake's North Shore Beach in her memory. This is a stark reminder to always be vigilant, assume drivers don't see you, and prioritize routes with dedicated paths, if possible.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Traffic Safety Reminder:** With recent tragic incidents involving runners and cyclists, always prioritize your safety. Wear bright colors, obey traffic laws, and assume drivers don't see you. Stick to well-lit paths and avoid distracted running or cycling.
</AlertBox>

So, yeah, it's a good day to get out there, but be smart about where you're going and what's going on around you. This isn't some pristine wilderness; it's Tempe.
