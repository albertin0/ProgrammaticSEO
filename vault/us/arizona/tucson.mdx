Look, if you're planning an outdoor workout in Tucson today, Feb 26, 2026, you've got a narrow window of opportunity before things get sweaty and complicated.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **The Good:** Low pollen count means your sinuses might actually thank you for getting outside today.
*   **The Bad:** Don't let the current mild air fool you. The National Weather Service is yelling about *record warmth* coming in, with temperatures hitting the mid-to-upper 80s and even low 90s starting today and through early next week. You are NOT acclimated to this kind of winter heat, so prepare for it to hit differently.
*   **The Ugly:** Good luck navigating the city. It's Rodeo Parade day, meaning downtown and surrounding streets will be a congested mess. And if you're thinking The Loop is your escape, think again.
</BulletList>

## Current Conditions Breakdown

| Pollutant Type       | Level    |
| :------------------- | :------- |
| Tree Pollen          | Low      |
| Grass Pollen         | Low      |
| Weed Pollen          | Low      |

Today's air quality is sitting at a **Moderate AQI of 54**, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. This means for most of us, it's probably fine, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel it. Keep an eye on the bigger picture too, because Pima County has been flagged for violating federal ozone standards, especially around Saguaro National Park-East. Not directly impacting today's AQI, but it's always lurking.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Impending Heat Wave!
The NWS is forecasting near-record to record high temperatures, climbing into the mid-80s to low 90s starting today and continuing into next week. While 25.5°C (77.9°F) might feel nice *right now*, your body isn't used to this in February. Hydrate aggressively, plan for early morning or late evening runs, and seriously consider moving indoors during the hottest parts of the day. This isn't summer heat; it's deceptive winter heat that can catch you off guard.

## Trail & Road Hazards: The Loop is a Minefield

If your usual route involves the Chuck Huckelberry Loop, brace yourself for a frustrating day of detours and potential bottlenecks. Pima County is working diligently, or so they say, which means *you* are doing the work of finding alternate paths.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### The Loop is Closing In!
Multiple sections of The Chuck Huckelberry Loop are under various states of closure or caution:
*   **Rillito River Section:** Single-lane closures on The Loop between Sunset Road and the Rillito River are happening *today* until 5 PM. Expect flaggers and delays.
*   **Santa Cruz Loop:** The north path between El Camino del Cerro and Commerce Drive is closed until April 30 for levee repair. Also, a temporary path closure at Gladden Fields Community Park in Marana for maintenance, with no reopening date yet.
*   **Julian Wash:** Get ready for overnight construction on the Julian Wash path under I-10 starting tomorrow, Feb 27, from 8 PM to 8 AM. Plus, there's a temporary closure near Irvington and Country Club until April 27, and the entire Julian Wash segment from Kino to Irvington is closed indefinitely due to the Mosaic Quarter sports complex construction.
*   **Santa Cruz River East Bank:** Erosion has compromised the east bank of the Santa Cruz Loop between Orange Grove and the Rillito River. Proceed with extreme caution.
</AlertBox>

Beyond The Loop, if you're heading for the trails:
*   Arthur Pack Regional Park/Maeveen Behan Desert Sanctuary Trails Park has intermittent closures until March 2026 for irrigation work.
*   Higher elevation sections of Control Road/Old Mount Lemmon Road are off-limits until March 1.
*   The Bear Canyon Trail and a good chunk of the wilderness boundary in the Santa Catalina Ranger District are under a long-term closure order until 2028. So, no Seven Falls access from that side.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Plan Ahead or Stay Flexible
With the Rodeo Parade and widespread Loop disruptions, consider running in your neighborhood or on a treadmill today. If you insist on hitting the trails, check Pima County's notices *before* you leave, and have a backup plan (or two, or three). This isn't the day to try a new route unprepared.
