Alright, Tucson, if you're hitting the pavement today, get it done early, because this afternoon is going to be a classic "only in February" kind of hot, and the city's a chaotic mess in spots.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Enjoy the morning, it's the best you're gonna get before temperatures climb into the mid-80s.
*   Ozone is your dominant pollutant today, sitting in the moderate range, which isn't ideal for smashing PRs.
*   Construction is everywhere, and downtown is a nightmare thanks to the Rodeo Parade.

## The Rundown: Don't Sweat the Small Stuff (Unless it's 86 Degrees)

Look, it's a beautiful clear morning, hovering around a pleasant 20°C (68°F), but don't let that fool you. The forecast says we're hitting a high of 30°C (86°F) today, which is about 15 degrees above normal for late February, and records might even fall this weekend. Seriously, who ordered summer in February? If you're planning an afternoon long run, think again.

Air quality is sitting at a moderate 70 AQI, with ozone being the main culprit. That's not terrible, but it's not great for those with sensitive lungs or if you're going for a really intense workout. The combination of rising temperatures and ozone means your lungs are going to work harder than they should for this time of year.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Afternoon Heat & Ozone Spike
Expect temperatures to soar this afternoon. If you must exercise outside later in the day, dial back your intensity, hydrate constantly, and consider moving your workout indoors to avoid the peak heat and ozone levels. Our friends at Pima County Health Department always preach caution during these unseasonably warm days.

Pollen counts are mercifully low today, so at least your sneezes won't be competing with your labored breathing from the ozone.

## Local Headaches: Where Not to Run, Bike, or Drive

### The Chuck Huckelberry Loop: A Construction Minefield
Ah, The Loop. Our pride and joy, currently under siege by construction crews. This week, specifically today (February 26th), expect single-lane closures between Sunset Road and the Rillito River from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. with flaggers directing traffic. If you were planning a serene ride or run along the Rillito River Park, be prepared for slowdowns and detours. Remember that the east bank of the Santa Cruz Loop between Orange Grove and the Rillito River is still compromised due to erosion, so keep an eye out if you're in that area.

Beyond The Loop, the City of Tucson continues its quest to rebuild every road simultaneously. Valencia Road is still a mess with underground work and prep for March paving, and Grant Road's widening project is ongoing through 2026. Up on the northside, Sunrise Drive is also undergoing trench replacement until late summer, with two-lane detours and flaggers. And don't even think about mountain biking at the future 100-Acre Wood Park; it's still closed for construction.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Rodeo Parade Chaos Downtown
Today is the annual Tucson Rodeo Parade, kicking off at 9 a.m. This massive non-motorized event brings significant road closures and absolute parking pandemonium, especially in the downtown area. If your workout plans involve going anywhere near downtown, reroute or prepare for major frustration. "Parking can be pretty terrible," and that's an understatement.

### Plan Your Escape
With so much going on, plan your routes carefully. Check Pima County's official Loop notices before you head out, and seriously, avoid downtown this morning unless you're there for the parade. Consider hitting some of the less-impacted trails in the foothills or sticking to neighborhood streets away from the major arteries.
