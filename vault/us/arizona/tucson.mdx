Today's a classic Tucson bait-and-switch: starts lovely, but by lunchtime, you'll be cooking faster than a desert roadrunner, and the air isn't doing your lungs any favors, either.

<BulletList>
*   **Scorching Forecast:** While it feels mild now, expect temperatures to rocket into the mid-80s to low-90s Fahrenheit (29-32°C) today through early next week. Your body isn't acclimated to this kind of heat in February, so what feels manageable quickly becomes dangerous.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** With an AQI of 69 and inhalable particulate matter (PM10) as the dominant pollutant, today's air quality is teetering on "unhealthy for sensitive groups." Don't be surprised if your usual route leaves you feeling more winded than normal.
*   **Loop Logistics:** Ongoing construction and erosion mean parts of The Chuck Huckelberry Loop are a mess or outright closed. Planning a long ride or run without checking for detours is just asking for frustration.
</BulletList>

The morning might feel like a gift, with clear skies and a comfortable 18.3°C (65°F), perfect for that early run or bike ride. But don't let that fool you. The National Weather Service is calling for near-record high temperatures by afternoon, pushing into the low 90s, which is May weather in February. If you're heading out for anything more than a quick jaunt, you need to adjust your plans, or you'll be feeling the effects long after you've cooled down. Our bodies simply aren't ready for this sudden spike, making heat illness a real risk even for seasoned desert dwellers.

Adding to the fun, our Air Quality Index is currently sitting at 69, landing squarely in the "Moderate" category. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (PM10), which can be an irritant even for healthy individuals during prolonged exposure, and it's definitely "unhealthy for sensitive groups." If you have any respiratory issues, or even if you don't, you might notice your breathing feeling a bit heavier than usual. It's not a "stay indoors" day, but it's certainly not a "breathe deep and easy" day either.

And, because Pima County loves keeping us on our toes, there are still some headaches on The Chuck Huckelberry Loop. That temporary closure on the Julian Wash path near Irvington and Country Club is still in effect until April 27th, forcing detours. Plus, keep an eye out on the Santa Cruz Loop between Orange Grove and the Rillito River – erosion has compromised parts of the east bank, so proceed with caution there. Don't assume your favorite stretch is clear; construction is the eternal companion of any public amenity around here.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| General     | Low     |

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### Heads Up: Early Season Heatwave!
The forecast highs in the low 90s (F) are no joke, especially when your body isn't used to it. Limit outdoor activity during the hottest part of the day, which means hitting the trails BEFORE 9 AM, or waiting until after sunset. Hydrate constantly, wear light clothing, and don't push it. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are serious.

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Mind the Air and Your Route
An AQI of 69 means moderate air quality with PM10. If you're sensitive, consider scaling back intensity or duration. Also, with ongoing work, especially along Julian Wash and parts of the Santa Cruz Loop, expect detours and keep an eye out for flaggers or unexpected hazards. Check Pima County's notices before you head out.

#### Pro Tip: Layer Up (and Down)
Given the wild temperature swings, dress in layers you can easily shed as the day heats up. Start chilly, end sweaty, but stay safe. And always, *always* carry more water than you think you need.
