Today’s your last chance to hit the trails without navigating a rodeo-induced gridlock, so make it count.

<BulletList>
  <li>**Air Quality is Moderate:** AQI is clocking in at 64 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not great, not terrible, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you'll feel it, especially as temps climb.</li>
  <li>**Pollen is Playing Nice:** Good news for the sniffle-squad; pollen levels are thankfully low today.</li>
  <li>**Trail Closures & Detours Are Your Reality:** Construction and maintenance are impacting major arteries of the multi-use path system. Plan for detours on The Loop.</li>

### The Rundown: Don't Be That Guy Stuck in Traffic

Alright, Tucson, let's talk brass tacks. It's Wednesday, February 25th, and you've got a window, albeit a shrinking one, to get your outdoor miles in before the city turns into a cowboy carnival. Today's weather is clear and warm at 27.9°C (about 82°F), which sounds lovely until you remember it’s February, and you're about to sweat through that "winter running" gear you optimistically pulled out. Hydration is non-negotiable. Seriously, bring more water than you think you need.

The air quality sits at a moderate 64 AQI, with ozone being the main culprit. This isn't wildfire smoke (thankfully, no local fires to report, though Kansas and Oklahoma are dealing with some containment efforts). But ozone can still make your chest feel a bit tight, especially combined with this unseasonable heat. If you're asthmatic or have other respiratory issues, keep it mellow, or stick to indoor workouts if you can't tolerate the air.

Now, for the fun part: dodging cones and "path closed" signs. You'd think with a city built for outdoor activity, we'd have our act together, but no, it's a constant game of whack-a-mole with closures.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Loop Lovers, Beware:** Multiple sections of The Chuck Huckelberry Loop are experiencing disruptions. The north path of the Santa Cruz Loop between El Camino del Cerro and Commerce Dr is closed through April 30th for levee repair. Additionally, there are single-lane closures on The Loop between Sunset Road and the Rillito River today until 5 p.m.. Flaggers will be out, so pay attention and don't plow through them like you own the place. You don't.
</AlertBox>

If you typically run or ride near Julian Wash, note the temporary closure near Irvington and Country Club until April 27th for ADOT work. There are detours, but they're rarely as seamless as they sound. And tomorrow night, if you're a night owl, the Julian Wash path under I-10 gets hit with overnight construction, again with flaggers present. Also, that I-10 bridge rehabilitation around the Amole interchange is still snarling traffic through Spring 2026, so factor that into your drive if you're heading to a trailhead on that side of town.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Arthur Pack Regional Park Advisory:** The Maeveen Behan Desert Sanctuary Trails Park within Arthur Pack has intermittent closures until March 2026 for irrigation line replacement. Check Pima County's website before you head out there, or you might find yourself doing an impromptu U-turn.
</AlertBox>

Finally, a heads-up: tomorrow kicks off the Tucson Rodeo Parade, which is no small affair. We're talking major road closures and a serious influx of people. Today is your last relatively clear day to run before the city gets swallowed by cowboy boots and mariachi bands. So get out there, but keep your head on a swivel, because it's not just the coyotes you need to watch out for.
