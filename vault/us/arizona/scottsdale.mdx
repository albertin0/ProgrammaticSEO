Today's a mixed bag, folks. Get out early if you're hitting the pavement, but don't plan on leisurely strolls through Old Town later.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Temperature Climbing:** Don't let the pleasant morning fool you. Temperatures are expected to soar into the low 90s later today, bringing a "Minor HeatRisk" to the lower deserts. That's not just a sweat, that's a *hazard*.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is sitting at 52, which is "Moderate." The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). While not terrible, it can be irritating for sensitive lungs.
*   **Old Town Gridlock:** The annual Parada del Sol Historic Parade and Trail's End Festival is running today, February 28th, right through Old Town Scottsdale. Expect major road closures and crowds of 30,000-35,000 people along Scottsdale Road. Forget your long run here; you'll be dodging tourists and horses.
*   **Ongoing Construction Annoyances:** That perpetual headache, the Scottsdale Road rebuilding project from Jojoba Road to Dixiletta Drive, is still chugging along. They're doing stuff with shared use paths and bike lanes, which means detours and frustrations for anyone not in a car. Also, keep an eye on Thompson Peak Parkway, where design work is underway for a second bridge, meant to improve a current safety concern where bike and car lanes merge over the existing structure. Construction is expected later this year, but it's a reminder of potential congestion and merging issues.
*   **Pollen is Low:** Good news for the sniffle-prone among us. Pollen levels are low today.

## The Daily Rundown:

### Weather

The morning is starting out clear and a respectable 19.8°C (67.6°F). However, don't let that fool you into thinking it's an all-day affair. The forecast indicates highs could hit a blistering 91°F (33°C) later in the day. The National Weather Service even issued a "Minor HeatRisk" advisory for our area. If you're planning a workout, make it an early one.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**DANGER: Significant Heat Risk This Afternoon!** Temperatures are projected to reach the low 90s. Hydrate relentlessly and reconsider any strenuous outdoor activity after 10 AM. Know the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Phoenix-area trails like Camelback Mountain and Piestewa Peak already have heat-related closures in effect when warnings are issued. Scottsdale might not close trails, but your body doesn't care about municipal boundaries.
</AlertBox>

### Air Quality

Our Air Quality Index is sitting at 52, which technically falls into the "Moderate" category. The main culprit? Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). While not alarming for most, it's enough to cause some irritation for those with sensitive respiratory systems. AccuWeather is even calling today's AQI "Poor" for sensitive groups.

<AlertBox type="info">
**AQI Tip:** If you're prone to asthma or have other lung issues, keep your workout intensity moderate today. Pay attention to how your lungs feel, especially with the PM10 floating around.

Finally, something straightforward. The desert isn't trying to murder your sinuses today.

### Local Hazards & Events

Look, Old Town Scottsdale is going to be a zoo. The Parada del Sol parade is a big deal, and it'll shut down Scottsdale Road and bring in massive crowds. If you thought you were going to get in some easy miles along the canal paths or through Old Town, think again. Your "trail" will be a sea of people.

Meanwhile, that perpetual construction on Scottsdale Road from Jojoba to Dixiletta is still underway, working on new shared use paths and bike lanes. It's progress, sure, but in the meantime, it means potential disruptions and detours for runners and cyclists. You might also encounter some activity near Thompson Peak Parkway as design work for a new bridge continues to address existing safety concerns for multi-modal users.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**WARNING: Old Town is a No-Go for Runs Today!** Unless you enjoy running a gauntlet of parade-goers and street festival revelers, steer clear of Old Town Scottsdale and Scottsdale Road, especially between Indian School Road and Camelback, for the Parada del Sol. Plan your routes further north or into the McDowell Sonoran Preserve if you want some clear space.
