Alright, Mesa, it's a mostly clear day out there, but don't go thinking you can just run wild without a care.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering in the "moderate" zone with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) as the dominant pollutant. This isn't "red alert," but it's certainly not doing your lungs any favors, especially if you're pushing serious mileage or have any respiratory issues.
*   Pollen levels are blessedly low today. Your sinuses can take a much-needed break from the usual desert assault.
*   Weather-wise, you can't beat it: clear skies and a comfortable 24°C (about 75°F). Perfect running temperatures, if only the air would cooperate more.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality: Moderate, Don't Push It

Yeah, the air is "moderate," which is the meteorological equivalent of "meh." An AQI of 55 with PM10 as the primary concern means you're breathing in tiny bits of... stuff. For most of us, it's probably fine for a moderate workout, but if you're hitting intervals or doing a long run, that particulate matter can irritate your respiratory system. People with asthma or other lung conditions? You know the drill. AccuWeather is even calling for "Poor" air quality for sensitive groups today and the next few days, so be smart.

### Construction Chaos Continues

If it feels like Mesa is constantly under construction, you're not wrong. Our city is a perpetual work-in-progress, and that means hazards for your outdoor workouts.
The **Red Mountain Shared Use Path** project, running along the east side of Power Road north of SR 202, is still deep in construction. They're doing demolition, utility installation, and paving, which means dust and detours are a constant companion. Those new paths will be great *eventually*, but right now, they're likely contributing to the very particulates we're seeing in the air.
And let's not forget the **Broadway Road Improvements** (from LeSueur to Spur, between Mesa Drive and Stapley Drive), which are kicking off this month and will be a two-year saga. Expect torn-up roads, sidewalk closures, and a general mess for anyone trying to run, walk, or bike through that stretch. They're putting in new sidewalks, bike lanes, and even upgrading traffic signals, but it's going to be a grind for a while.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads up on the Trails & Roads!** Construction on the Red Mountain Shared Use Path and Broadway Road means increased dust, unexpected detours, and potential uneven surfaces. Stay alert, watch for heavy equipment, and consider alternate routes.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Keep it Hydrated, Inside and Out:** Even with pleasant temperatures, the desert air can be drying. Drink plenty of water. And if your throat feels scratchy after your run, it might be the PM10, so consider rinsing out your sinuses.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

### Events & Other Annoyances
While there aren't any massive marathon-blocking events today, there *is* an "Out to Lunch Concert Series" at the Mesa Arts Center. It's unlikely to block your favorite canal path, but if you're running downtown, expect a bit more foot traffic around lunchtime.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**AQI Advisory for Sensitive Groups:** With a moderate AQI driven by particulate matter, if you have asthma, COPD, or other respiratory sensitivities, consider taking your workout indoors today or significantly reducing your outdoor exertion.
</AlertBox>

In short, it's a prime example of a beautiful Mesa day with just enough environmental caveats to keep you on your toes. Go run, but don't be a hero.
