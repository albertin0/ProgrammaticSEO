Alright, Mesa, stop complaining about winter, because today's a clear shot for getting those miles in, provided you manage the unseasonable heat.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Unseasonably high temperatures mean you'll be sweating harder than usual. It's pushing well into the upper 70s, possibly even the low 80s, which is a solid 10-15 degrees above average for late February. That means your body is working overtime to stay cool.
*   Trail access at Usery Mountain Regional Park is still a no-go for some popular routes, thanks to lingering closures from the Mesa Marathon. The Merkle and Vista Trails remain off-limits until March 5th. Plan your long runs accordingly, or face a detour.
*   Your lungs are getting a break today: air quality is fantastic, and pollen levels are low. Just watch out for localized construction dust, because Mesa is always building something.

## What to Watch Out For

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Heat, Even in February
Seriously, 79 degrees in February? This isn't the "dry heat" you brag about in July; this is a precursor. The National Weather Service is calling for well above normal temperatures and afternoon highs that could hit the mid-80s to even upper 90s in lower desert areas, triggering a "Minor HeatRisk." If you're planning a long effort, especially out at somewhere exposed like the trails around Papago Park or the Las Sendas area, start early, carry more water than you think you need, and don't be a hero. Listen to your body. Dehydration sneaks up faster than you think when it's this warm.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Usery Mountain Regional Park Trail Closures
Heads up, trail runners! The fallout from the Mesa Marathon (which was on February 14th) means parts of Usery Mountain Regional Park are still impacted. Specifically, the Merkle and Vista Trails are under temporary closure until March 5th. Don't get out there expecting to hit your favorite loops only to be turned around. Check the Maricopa County Parks & Recreation alerts before you head east on Usery Pass Road, unless you enjoy running into "trail closed" signs.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Construction Chaos
Mesa's booming, and that means construction is pretty much everywhere. We're seeing new communities popping up, like the one The NRP Group just broke ground on near the Medina Station Master Plan, and another 222-unit development, The Homestead at Lehi, on E. McDowell Road. Ashton Woods is also planning over 400 new homes, including a "trail and path network" near Mesa Gateway Airport. While new paths are great eventually, these projects mean potential for construction traffic, dust, and detours on surrounding streets and existing paths. Even the Red Mountain Shared-Use Path is in its "final phases," which implies there could still be some minor landscaping work ongoing. Keep your head on a swivel when you're on two wheels or two feet near any active sites.

Overall, it's a fantastic day to get outside if you plan smart for the heat and know your trail options. Enjoy it before the *real* summer heat decides to show up.
