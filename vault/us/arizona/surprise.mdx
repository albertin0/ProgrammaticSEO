If you're looking to hit the trails or the pavement in Surprise today, you might want to consider an earlier start or stick to indoor workouts, because while the weather's sweet, the air isn't quite as fresh as you'd hope.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** An AQI of 72 with inhalable particulate matter and "poor" nitrogen dioxide levels means your lungs will be doing extra work today. Not ideal for a PR attempt or if you're sensitive to that stuff.
*   **Clear Skies & Cool Temps (Mostly):** While the air quality isn't perfect, at least the sky is clear and the morning temps are in the low 70s (21.8°C). It will warm up fast, hitting a high near 89°F later today, so plan accordingly.
*   **Low Pollen:** Good news for allergy sufferers, the pollen count is low, so at least your sinuses should get a break.

### Watch Your Lungs: Particulate Matter & NO2

That AQI of 72 might seem okay, but the dominant pollutant being inhalable particulate matter (PM10) means tiny crud is floating around. This stuff gets deep into your lungs and can cause issues, especially for anyone with existing respiratory conditions. Add in the "poor" Nitrogen Dioxide levels, and it's a double whammy for your airways. Take it easy, consider shortening your run, and definitely listen to your body.

While there aren't any major trail closures reported in Surprise for today, you might encounter some traffic headaches if your route takes you near US 60 (Grand Avenue). The Arizona Department of Transportation has scheduled overnight intermittent rolling closures on US 60 from Deer Valley Road to Loop 303, including turn lanes, from 8 p.m. tonight until 5 a.m. tomorrow morning. These are "intermittent," meaning traffic might be stopped for up to 15 minutes at a time. So, if you're out early morning or late evening, be prepared for some unexpected stops or detours.

### Hydration is Still Key, Even if It's Not Scorching

Don't let the pleasant morning fool you. With highs pushing close to 90 degrees this afternoon, you'll still be sweating. Carry plenty of water, and consider a route with shade, especially if you're hitting the Surprise Community Park trails later in the day. This isn't the kind of heat that'll immediately lay you out, but it's enough to cause problems if you're not smart about hydration.
