Alright, Gilbert, let's talk turkey. Today's a classic case of "looks good, but check the fine print" for getting your workout in outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **The mercury is climbing, fast.** While your early morning miles might feel crisp at around 19.8°C (that's about 68°F for you Celsius-averse folks), the forecast says we're hitting near-record highs, possibly up to 33°C (92°F) later today. That's not just "warm," that's "actively trying to bake you" hot, especially for February. If you're not out before the sun gets serious, you're playing with fire (metaphorically, thank goodness, no active wildfires nearby for Gilbert today).
*   **The air's got grit.** Our AQI is sitting at 59, which is "Moderate," and the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter. This isn't usually a killer, but it's enough to annoy your lungs, especially if you're pushing hard. While there's no official smoke forecast, guess what kicks up a ton of particulate matter? All the construction around town.
*   **Construction chaos continues its reign.** Forget smooth sailing if your route touches a freeway. Eastbound Loop 202 is shut down between Lindsay Road and Val Vista Drive until Sunday afternoon, taking several on-ramps with it, including Gilbert and Cooper. Even if you're not driving, this means more local traffic trying to find detours, making sidewalks and bike lanes sketchier than usual.

</BulletList>

### Mind the Road Blocks, Runners & Riders

If your usual long run involves the **Loop 202 corridor**, adjust your plans. The eastbound closure means you'll hit detours and heavier-than-normal traffic on surface streets. Think ahead, map an alternate, or stick to trails well away from the freeway mess. The last thing you need is a surprise sprint across six lanes of angry drivers.

### Early Bird Gets the... Less Sticky Workout

Seriously, if you're planning any significant outdoor activity today, do it now, or wait until after sundown. Those high temperatures are no joke, and a "low" pollen count doesn't mean your allergies won't randomly decide today's the day for a full-blown assault anyway. Get hydrated, stay hydrated, and don't try to PR in the midday sun.

### Gilbert Road: Still a Work in Progress

Parts of **Gilbert Road** near the Heritage Park development are seeing intermittent lane reductions for ongoing infrastructure work through March. While today's a Saturday, meaning some crews might be off, the road infrastructure improvements are a constant, dusty presence. Cyclists and pedestrians, keep your heads up. Also, the Heritage District Farmers Market is on today, so expect extra foot traffic if you're running through downtown.
