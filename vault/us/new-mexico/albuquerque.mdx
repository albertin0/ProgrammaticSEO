Alright, get out there while you can, because the winds are playing nice today before they decide to kick up a fuss again tomorrow.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Moderate:** Your lungs aren't going to love the inhalable particulate matter floating around (AQI 74), but it's not terrible. Sensitive folks might feel it.
*   **Pollen is Hanging Around:** Moderate pollen levels mean your nose might be a bit itchy, but it's not enough to keep most of you indoors.
*   **The Wind is Giving You a Break (Today):** After a few blustery days, today is a brief reprieve from the strong winds. Enjoy it, because Friday's forecast is looking gusty again.
</BulletList>

Look, I've run the Paseo del Bosque Trail enough times to know a good day when I see one, and today is one of those fleeting moments before the true spring chaos kicks in. The air is clear (visually, anyway), the temperature is sitting pretty at 14.7°C (that's pushing 59°F for the Fahrenheit crowd), and for once, your hat might actually stay on your head.

However, let's not pretend it's all sunshine and roses. We've got our usual Albuquerque moderate air quality, with inhalable particulate matter being the main culprit. It's not "stay indoors and seal the windows" bad, but if you've got asthma or are just generally prone to wheezing, take it easy on those longer, harder efforts. Think comfortable pace, not "I'm chasing a PR" pace.

**Tip for the Lungs:** Keep your water intake up. Hydration helps your respiratory system handle those moderate pollutants and dry air.

Pollen is also moderate, which for some of you means a runny nose and itchy eyes. It's not going to cripple your workout, but be prepared with whatever antihistamine cocktail works for you. Don't be that person sniffling through your entire run, blaming it on allergies when you could have popped a pill an hour ago.

Now, for the actual hazards you might encounter beyond your own body trying to betray you. Construction is always a thing in this city. If you're planning on cycling or running near the Central & Unser Transit Center, know that construction is impacting access and bus routes there. Same goes for Central Avenue between Broadway Blvd. and 1st St., and southbound Carlisle between Carlisle Pl. and Vail Ave. These aren't usually blocking major recreational trails, but if your route takes you on city streets, keep your head on a swivel. Don't assume drivers see you just because you're in fluorescent yellow.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Road Construction Alert:** Persistent roadwork around Central & Unser Transit Center, Central Avenue (Broadway to 1st St.), and southbound Carlisle (Carlisle Pl. to Vail Ave.) means extra vigilance for runners and cyclists on city streets. Expect detours and be aware of heavy equipment.
</AlertBox>

Finally, that calm wind? It's a gift. The forecast says Friday, February 27th, will see the return of those strong winds. So if you've been putting off that long run or a tough bike ride, today's your day to seize it before Albuquerque turns into a giant hair dryer again.
