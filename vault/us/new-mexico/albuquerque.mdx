Today's a classic Albuquerque day where you'll either love the warmth or curse the wind, so pick your poison.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
- **Warm & Sunny:** You've got clear skies and temps pushing into the low 70s (22.7°C), which usually means prime running weather for February. Enjoy it while it lasts.
- **Windy City:** We're looking at blustery conditions with northwest gusts up to 25-40 mph across central parts of the metro. That'll make your westward push on the Paseo del Bosque a grind and kick up dust.
- **Pollen & Particulates:** AQI is Moderate at 70, with fine and coarse particulate matter hanging around. Plus, juniper pollen is high, so if you're sensitive, your sinuses are already plotting against you.

## The Down and Dirty Details

Look, it’s February 25th, and we're seeing temperatures well above normal, flirting with 80 degrees in some parts of New Mexico this week. This is great for shaking off the winter blues, but it comes with a few desert-specific caveats you'd be foolish to ignore.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Wildfire Warning: High Risk Today

That warm, dry air combined with strong northwest winds means **heightened wildfire danger** is a serious concern. Critical fire weather conditions are expected in parts of New Mexico, and any spark could spread fast. Avoid any activities that could cause a fire, especially if you're out near the dry arroyos or the fringes of the Bosque. Seriously, don't be *that* person.
</AlertBox>

### What Your Lungs Are Up Against

The AQI sitting at 70 (Moderate) means those tiny inhalable particulate matters are present. For most folks, it's probably fine, but if you've got lung issues, you might feel it. Couple that with "High" juniper pollen counts (and moderate oak and cottonwood), and you're looking at a potential snot-fest and itchy eyes on your run.

Here's a quick pollen breakdown from yesterday's data, which isn't going to change drastically overnight:

| Pollen Type | Level (Feb 24, 2026) |
| :---------- | :------------------- |
| Juniper     | High (239)           |
| Oak         | Medium (77)          |
| Cottonwood  | Medium (54)          |
| Alder       | Low (7)              |
| Elm         | Low (3)              |


### Trail Alerts & Construction Zones

Good news on the flooding front: The Rio Grande at Albuquerque is at a healthy 3.30 ft, well below flood stage, and there's been no significant rainfall in the last 24 hours. So, your favorite sections of the Bosque Trail should be clear.

However, the **Albuquerque Rail Trail** construction is still chugging along. If you’re planning a route around Downtown, Old Town, or the Sawmill Market area, expect detours. The section between Tiguex Park and Sawmill Market is still under construction, with a new ramp near Central Avenue and Alvarado station also in progress. Plan for some reroutes or stick to areas further afield if construction noise or blockages annoy you. The City of Albuquerque is also adding final lights to the Tom Bolack Trail in early 2026, which shouldn't impact access much, but good to know for those early morning or evening runs.

### Stay Hydrated, Smarty Pants

Even though it’s February, these unseasonably warm temperatures mean you still need to be smart about hydration. Carry water, especially if you're hitting the long routes along the Paseo del Bosque. Don't let the calendar trick you into thinking it's not still the desert.
