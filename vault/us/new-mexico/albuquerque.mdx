It's a surprisingly warm late-February day, so while the sun is out, you'll need to pay attention to your lungs and your hydration.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is moderate:** With an AQI of 73 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, your lungs might feel it, especially if you're pushing the pace.
*   **Unexpected heat:** We're looking at near-record high temperatures this weekend, with today's forecast hitting up to 23°C (74°F). That's not typical for February, and can quickly lead to dehydration if you're not careful.
*   **Moderate pollen count:** The trees are already getting a jump on things, so expect some sniffles and sneezes if you're sensitive.
</BulletList>

## Today's Rundown

Looks like winter decided to pack its bags early this year. We've got clear skies and temps climbing well into the 70s by afternoon, which is less "late February" and more "late April." If you're planning a long run along the Bosque trail or up by the base of the Sandias, that warmth is going to feel great initially, but it'll wear you down faster than you'd expect for this time of year. Don't be a hero; carry water and hydrate more than usual.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch the Ozone!
That AQI of 73, with ozone being the main culprit, means your respiratory system is going to be working harder than usual. If you've got asthma or other lung issues, consider scaling back your intensity or hitting the treadmill. For everyone else, just be mindful; don't push yourself to the point of gasping for air on those climbs near Elena Gallegos.

Pollen is still hanging around at a moderate level. For the true allergy sufferers, you know the drill: pre-medicate, wear sunglasses, and probably plan your cooldown near a shower.

### Construction & City Snags

If your route takes you through downtown, specifically around the **Downtown Albuquerque Station**, be aware that pedestrian access from the north side of Central Ave. and First St. is still messed up due to ongoing city construction. It's been like that since January, so if that's part of your regular loop, plan an alternate path to avoid unexpected detours or navigating through active work zones.

### Wind Wisdom (because it's New Mexico)
While there aren't any extreme wind warnings for today, it's Albuquerque. There's always a chance for some gusty conditions, especially as the day warms up. Remember that a strong headwind on your way out means a glorious tailwind on your way back, but it also means more effort and potential for stuff getting in your eyes.

## Pollen Breakdown

| :---------- | :------- |
| Trees       | Moderate |

Seriously, stay safe out there. Don't let this fake spring fool you into forgetting the basics.
