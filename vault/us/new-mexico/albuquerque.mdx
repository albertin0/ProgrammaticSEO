If you're planning an outdoor workout in Albuquerque today, just know you'll be fighting the wind like it stole your last burrito, and your allergies might join the protest.

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   **Gusty Winds Galore:** Forget a leisurely jog, you'll be battling Northwest winds anywhere from 20-25 mph, with gusts reaching up to 35 mph today. That’s enough to knock you sideways on the Paseo del Bosque Trail, so prepare for a full-body workout, whether you want one or not.
*   **Pollen and Particulates Present:** Our usual suspects are back. We're sitting at a moderate pollen level, with juniper doing its worst, and the air quality index is moderate at 51 due to inhalable particulate matter. Your lungs might feel a bit put-upon, even if you’re not gasping for breath.
*   **"Perfect" Temps, But Don't Get Fooled:** While the mercury is hitting a pleasant 18.2°C (around 65°F), that wind will negate a lot of that warmth, especially if you're out there for a while. Good for staying cool, bad for feeling cozy.
</BulletList>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Wind, Seriously.
Those gusts up to 35 mph aren't just an annoyance; they're a legitimate hazard. If you're running on exposed sections of trail, especially near the Rio Grande, or cycling, a sudden gust can throw you off balance and cause a nasty fall. Stay clear of areas with loose debris or tree limbs.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Air Quality & Allergy Check
While the overall AQI is moderate, AccuWeather is flagging today and the next few days as "Poor" for air quality, especially for sensitive groups, due to pollutants like nitrogen dioxide. Combine that with the moderate juniper pollen, and anyone with respiratory issues or allergies should seriously consider an indoor alternative, or at least shorten their outdoor time.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Trail Condition Alert: Paseo del Bosque
Word from early January hinted at a Bosque Bike Trail closure near the ABQ Riverside Drain, with no specified end date. While not confirmed in the last 24 hours as an *active* closure, it's worth checking local sources or considering alternative routes if your run takes you through that area. Nothing worse than hitting a "TRAIL CLOSED" sign mid-stride.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Wildfire Danger on the Horizon
With near-record February heat hitting New Mexico, there's a heightened wildfire danger. While we don't have active fires impacting Albuquerque right now, this means dry conditions. Be extra vigilant with anything that could spark a fire, and if you see smoke, report it immediately.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're tough enough to face the wind and your lungs can handle a little juniper-laced PM10, go for it. Just don't say I didn't warn you when you find yourself running backward into a tumbleweed.
