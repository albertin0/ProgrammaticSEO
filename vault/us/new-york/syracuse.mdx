If you're heading out for a run today, bundle up, because while the air is clear, it's seriously cold and icy patches are a real threat.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
  <li>**Brutal Temps & Wind Chill:** The mercury's hovering around -2°C (28°F), but with a consistent 5-10 mph wind and occasional gusts, it'll feel much colder. We're talking wind chills that make your bones ache, especially if you're not properly layered.</li>
  <li>**Icy Underfoot:** While the snow isn't heavy, there are likely icy patches lurking on untreated sidewalks and secondary roads, particularly after overnight lows in the teens. One wrong step on the Onondaga Creekwalk, and you're looking at a twisted ankle or worse. Stay vigilant.</li>
  <li>**Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is sitting at 72 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not a lung-buster, but it's not pristine either. Coupled with the cold, it means your lungs will be working a bit harder.</li>
</BulletList>

## The Cold, Hard Truth

Look, I get it. We're Syracuse runners. We've seen worse. But "worse" doesn't mean "smart." Today is one of those days where you really need to question if that outdoor session is worth it. The main hazard isn't some crazy blizzard — it's the insidious combination of frigid temperatures, biting wind, and the black ice waiting to take you down.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ### Watch Your Step!
  Overnight temperatures below freezing mean any lingering moisture has turned to ice. Surfaces that look merely wet could be treacherous. Stick to main roads and paths you know are well-cleared and salted. If you're hitting spots like the Onondaga Creekwalk, proceed with extreme caution, as it's known to occasionally flood and develop icy spots.

### Your Lungs & What They're Up Against

| Pollutant | Level     | AQI  |
| :-------- | :-------- | :--- |
| Pollen    | Low       | N/A  |
| Ozone     | Moderate  | 72   |

The air quality isn't going to kill you, but a moderate AQI combined with freezing air means your respiratory system is under more stress. If you're prone to asthma or have sensitive lungs, consider taking it inside today or keeping your workout short and easy.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### Dress Like a Michelin Man (Seriously)
  Multiple layers are your best friend. Windproof outer shell is non-negotiable. Don't forget insulated gloves, a hat that covers your ears, and a neck gaiter to protect your face and warm the air you breathe. Exposed skin in these conditions is asking for frostnip.

## Trail Talk: Onondaga Creekwalk

The Onondaga Creekwalk is usually a gem, connecting the city's Southside to Onondaga Lake. However, sections of it, especially from the Wallace Street Trailhead through Franklin Square, are prone to flooding and subsequent ice formation during these colder months. If you're determined to get out there, consider the sections closer to Onondaga Lake Park that might be more exposed and thus less likely to hold standing water and ice, but still, be aware. No news reports indicate specific closures today, but that doesn't mean conditions are ideal.

  ### Construction Corner: No Major Disruptions Today
  Good news for your route planning: no major workout-impacting construction or events have been reported for today, February 26th, within Syracuse city limits. While the I-81 viaduct project continues and SU has various renovations in the pipeline, nothing specific is blocking public workout paths today.
