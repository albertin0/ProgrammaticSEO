Alright, Syracuse, if you're itching to get out there today, you can, but don't be surprised if it feels a bit... *blah*.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is hitting a moderate 67 with ozone as the main culprit. For most of us, it's not a showstopper, but if your lungs usually throw a fit with anything above "good," consider keeping it indoors, especially if you're pushing serious mileage or speed.
*   Temperatures are hovering around 3.8°C (39°F) and it's currently clear, but don't let that fool you. Some forecasts hinted at light rain or snow earlier, and the ground might still be damp from overnight moisture, meaning potentially slick patches, particularly in shaded areas or on less-trafficked routes. Watch your footing.
*   Good news for the sniffle squad: pollen levels are mercifully low today. So at least your nose won't be staging a rebellion.

## Trail Talk: Onondaga Creekwalk

The Onondaga Creekwalk is always a solid option for urban miles, but remember it occasionally floods and closes, particularly the stretch from Wallace Street through Franklin Square. While there aren't any *current* closures for today, always check conditions if we've had any significant precipitation recently. The city also completed a security camera initiative on the Creekwalk recently, which is nice, but cameras don't stop you from slipping on ice.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch Your Step, Especially on the Way Back
Although it's clear now, keep in mind that temperatures are expected to drop near or below freezing tonight. Any lingering moisture on pavement, bridges, or shaded trails, especially on the Creekwalk's exposed sections, could turn into black ice later in the day. If you're planning an evening run, assume things will be slick.

### Dress for the Elements (and the Ozone)
Layers are your friend for this kind of weather – start a bit chilly, and shed as you warm up. As for the moderate AQI, if you're sensitive to ozone, try to run earlier in the morning or later in the evening when ozone levels tend to be lower, or just dial back the intensity.
</AlertBox>

It's not a perfect day, but it's not a write-off either. Just bring your brain with you, dress smart, and keep an eye on your footing.
