This Thursday, the city might *look* clear, but don't let those blue skies fool you; you're still navigating the icy hangover from Winter Storm Hernando.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   Expect sneaky patches of black ice and general slickness, especially on less-trafficked paths and shaded areas, thanks to the recent freeze and any residual snowmelt.
*   Air quality is hanging out in the "Moderate" zone, mostly from fine particulate matter, so your lungs aren't getting a free pass today.
*   Ongoing construction projects mean you'll need to keep your head on a swivel for detours and unexpected obstacles on some popular routes.

## Today's Vitals

## The Rundown: Don't Break Your Neck (Or Your PR)

Alright, New York, let's talk real. We just collectively dug ourselves out of a "historic snowstorm", and while the sun's out, that doesn't magically vaporize all the ice. Yesterday, we had advisories for light snow and freezing temps, which means prime conditions for black ice formation, particularly early in the morning or in spots that haven't seen much sun.

I saw a few runners complain about slick pedestrian paths in **Central Park** just a couple of days ago, even as the main loop was reportedly clear. Don't assume anything is perfectly safe just because it *looks* dry. That invisible enemy, black ice, is still lurking, ready to send you to my office with a sprained ankle or worse.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Ice, Ice, Baby (No, Not the Good Kind)
The biggest hazard today is undoubtedly black ice. After a significant snowfall and recent freezing temperatures, any wet patches can re-freeze, making sidewalks, bridges, and less-salted park paths treacherous. Assume all wet-looking surfaces are potentially icy. Seriously, wear shoes with some grip, and maybe don't try for a new PR on the *downhills* today.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the delightful background hum of constant city construction. The **Hudson River Park segment of the Empire State Trail**, for instance, is gearing up for a detour starting in March due to the Manhattan Tunnel Project. While the major narrowing isn't official *yet*, you can bet your bottom dollar there's always something popping up unexpectedly. Keep an eye out for barriers, changed pedestrian/bike lane configurations, and general truck traffic.

Our AQI is sitting at 59, which is "Moderate." The dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter, probably just the usual urban cocktail. If you've got asthma or are otherwise sensitive, this is your cue to perhaps keep your intense sprints a little shorter or stick to routes with more green space. Don't go sucking down lungfuls of exhaust if you don't have to.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Construction Chaos Continues
Always be aware of your surroundings. While no massive trail closures were announced specifically for *today*, permits for new buildings and alterations are a constant in this city. Expect localized construction zones near major roadways and keep an eye out for unexpected detours on your usual routes. Better to add a minute to your run than end up in a construction pit.

Finally, it's 1.9°C out there. That's above freezing, but just barely. Dress in layers, my friends. Wind chill can make that feel a lot colder, and you want to be able to shed a layer once you warm up, not freeze your butt off waiting for the subway home.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Gear Up for the Chill & Particles
Even with clear skies, 1.9°C is cold. Wear layers that can be adjusted. Consider a light hat and gloves. If you're sensitive to air quality, and even though the AQI is moderate, sometimes a light buff or mask can help filter out some of those fine particulates. Just listen to your body.
