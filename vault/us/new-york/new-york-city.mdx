If you thought today was a pristine, post-blizzard winter wonderland run day, bless your heart. While the sun's out, don't let the blue sky fool you; this city is still recovering from a full-blown smackdown.

<BulletList>
*   The city is still buried. We're talking "mountains of snow" and "drifts up to 8 feet" in some spots, even on thoroughfares. That fresh 1.8 inches Long Island got this morning isn't making cleanup easier, either.
*   Cold air, meet your lungs. While it's 4.9°C, that's still brisk enough to make your respiratory system work overtime, especially when combined with the air quality.
*   Your lungs might feel a bit like you ran through a dusty attic. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "moderate" 73, with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant.

Look, I get it. We're runners. We don't stop for a little chilly weather. But today requires a dose of reality before you lace up those expensive shoes and hit the pavement or, more likely, a slushy, icy mess. The "Blizzard of 2026" dropped a record amount of snow just a few days ago, with Central Park seeing nearly 20 inches and some parts of Staten Island getting over two feet. While the major storm has passed, that much snow doesn't just evaporate. We're still in cleanup mode, and that means treacherous conditions.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Ice, Ice, Baby! And Not the Good Kind.**
Despite the clear skies, expect significant ice patches, especially in shaded areas or where snow has melted and refrozen. Sidewalks, lesser-used trails, and even some bike lanes (looking at you, Kent Avenue, which was a mess a few weeks ago after the *last* storm and likely worse now) are probably unplowed and ripe for a nasty fall. A sprained ankle or a fractured wrist from a slip on the Hudson River Park path is not the kind of PR you want to set.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Breathe Deeply, or Don't.**
The AQI at 73 isn't terrible, but "moderate" with fine particulate matter means sensitive individuals might notice some irritation. Combined with the cold air, it's not ideal for pushing hard efforts. If you have asthma or other respiratory issues, seriously consider an indoor alternative today, or keep your outdoor efforts short and easy.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for the Refrigerator, Not Just the Freezer.**
It's 4.9°C (around 41°F), which isn't "extreme cold" like we saw earlier this month when wind chills hit "well below zero". But you're going to be moving. Layer up properly with moisture-wicking gear, a wind-resistant outer layer, gloves, and a hat. Traction is your friend; consider shoes with good grip or even microspikes if you plan to hit anything less-trafficked than a perfectly plowed street (good luck finding one of those).

Construction is always a wildcard in this city, and while there aren't any *new* major running-specific closures today, ongoing projects like those in Bronx Park and Owl's Head Park mean you should always keep an eye out for detours or equipment. But honestly, the snow and ice are your biggest immediate headaches.
