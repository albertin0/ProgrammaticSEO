Today, the clear skies are a total bait-and-switch. Don't let that sunshine fool you into thinking it's all smooth sailing out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Falling Ice & Snow Hazards:** The temps are *just* above freezing, then dropping. That means any snow and ice still clinging to buildings, awnings, and bridges is ready to shed itself onto unsuspecting heads. Seriously, watch out.
*   **Lingering Black Ice:** While major thoroughfares might be mostly clear, anything shaded, off the beaten path, or less-traveled (I'm looking at you, lesser-known loops in Prospect Park) is probably a sheet of invisible danger.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** AQI is clocking in at 67, with Nitrogen Dioxide as our special guest pollutant. Not apocalyptic, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you'll feel it on those faster efforts.

## The City's Still Thawing Out

Alright, New Yorkers. February 28th and we're *still* dealing with the fallout from that "historic and crippling blizzard" that dumped almost 20 inches on Central Park just days ago. Yeah, I know, the sun's out, it feels almost spring-like in comparison to last week, but your body isn't an ice-skate.

First, let's talk about the temperature swing. It's currently hovering around freezing (-1.2°C), but it's supposed to warm up to 8°C later today. That's prime time for frozen chunks of snow and ice to come crashing down from buildings. Mayor Mamdani explicitly warned about this on February 25th, saying "as temperatures rise later this week, we will see snow and ice falling from buildings. This can be extremely dangerous. I encourage all New Yorkers to stay alert while walking outside." He's not wrong. A concussion from a falling ice chunk is not the kind of PR your run needs.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Danger: Watch Your Head!
Seriously, look up. Falling ice and snow from rooftops, scaffolding, and trees is a significant hazard today, especially as temperatures fluctuate. A helmet won't cut it against a projectile ice block. Stick to open areas or under protective canopies when possible.
</AlertBox>

Even if you're hitting popular spots like Prospect Park, where the NYRR Al Gordon 5K is happening today, don't assume every inch is perfectly clear. Event organizers do their best, but shaded paths, bridges, and less-maintained areas are still likely to be slick with black ice. A Redditor back in late January was already complaining about uncleared bike paths in parts of Brooklyn, like Kent Ave and near the Navy Yard, after an earlier storm, so imagine what's still lurking from the *big* one.

Your lungs? They're facing a "Moderate" AQI of 67, thanks to Nitrogen Dioxide. It's not the worst we've seen, but for those pushing their pace, it's definitely something to be aware of. Breathe deeply, but maybe don't plan your personal best today if you're prone to respiratory grumbles.

### Pollen Report
| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Good news on the sniffles front: pollen is low. So at least your eyes won't be watering from allergies while you're dodging ice bombs.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Slippery Situations
Even if you see clear pavement, assume there's black ice. Treat any damp or shiny patch like it's a banana peel. Seriously, slow down, shorten your stride, and wear shoes with good tread. A sprained ankle or a fractured wrist from a fall is a guaranteed way to derail your training for weeks.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Dress for the Deception
It might look sunny, but it's still cold. Dress in layers. Wind chill will make that -1°C feel colder than it is. And those fluctuating temps mean sweat can turn to ice surprisingly fast if you're not careful.
</AlertBox>

Today's one of those days where a treadmill run or some indoor strength training doesn't sound half bad. But if you're stubborn (like me), take it easy, be vigilant, and don't assume the city has perfectly scrubbed itself clean. It's New York, not a pristine nature preserve.
