Today? If you *must* hit the pavement, be smarter than usual, because NYC is still defrosting from a beating.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
  <li>**Slick City:** The aftermath of a "historic snowfall" means black ice is your uninvited workout partner, especially on sidewalks and less-traveled paths.</li>
  <li>**Chilly Air:** Temperatures are hovering just above freezing, but wind chill can make it feel much colder, biting into exposed skin.</li>
  <li>**Moderate Air Quality:** Fine particulate matter is still the dominant pollutant, keeping the AQI in the "moderate" zone.</li>
</BulletList>

Alright, New Yorkers, shake off that post-blizzard cabin fever, but for the love of your ankles, pay attention. We just got hammered with over two feet of snow in some spots, and while Sanitation has been busting their chops, the city isn't exactly a dry track. We saw "historic snowfall" recently, and even with today's "clear" skies and light snow having mostly tapered off this morning, you're not out of the woods.

The temperature right now is a balmy 2°C (36°F), but it *feels* like -1°C (31°F). More importantly, overnight lows were around freezing, meaning any melted snow refroze into treacherous, invisible patches of black ice. Bridges, overpasses, and those shaded spots where the sun never quite reaches are prime locations for a nasty spill. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) even issued a Winter Operations Advisory, expecting another 1 to 3 inches of new snow on top of the recent monster storm. This isn't just a nuisance; it's a legitimate hazard for runners and cyclists. So, if your usual run takes you along the Hudson River Greenway, especially anywhere near the docks or tree-lined sections, assume it's slicker than a politician's promise.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Black Ice Warning:** Seriously, folks. Even if the pavement *looks* dry, assume there's black ice lurking. Bridges, overpasses, and shady areas are particularly dangerous. Keep your eyes peeled for those shiny, dark patches that are actually pure ice. A bad fall on ice can lead to sprains, fractures, or worse.
</AlertBox>

On the air quality front, we're sitting at an AQI of 61 with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as the main culprit. That's "moderate," which sounds okay, but it means that if you're unusually sensitive to air pollution, you might still feel it. Given the recent cold and potential for stagnant air trapping emissions, it’s not ideal for deep-breathing, high-intensity efforts, even though it's nowhere near the "unhealthy for sensitive groups" level we saw last week.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Dress for the Deep Freeze:** It's 2°C, but the wind chill makes it feel colder. Layer up, protect your extremities, and consider wind-resistant outer layers. Hypothermia isn't just for Everest climbers; prolonged exposure in these temps can be dangerous.

Don't forget the city is a constant construction zone, and some projects are massive. The Hudson Tunnel Project is back on, with work resuming in New York and New Jersey, involving significant excavation and marine platform construction in Manhattan. More directly impacting your outdoor plans, starting in March, the Empire State Trail's Hudson River Park segment between W. 29th and W. 30th Street will see a "small detour" due to "Manhattan Tunnel Project work." This means narrower paths for bikes and pedestrians and construction trucks crossing the trail. While that's technically next month, it's a reminder to always be aware of your surroundings, especially if you're weaving through the west side.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Mind the Construction:** While no major trail *closures* are in effect today, the city is always under construction. Keep an eye out for unexpected detours, construction vehicles, and uneven surfaces, especially around the West Side Highway and Midtown areas.
