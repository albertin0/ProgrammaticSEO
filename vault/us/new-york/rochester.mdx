Alright, Rochester, listen up. Today's a day where you'll be glad you layered up, because while the skies are clear, the air sure isn't warm.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Bone-Chilling Cold:** Temperatures are well below freezing, and while there's no major snow expected, lingering ice from yesterday's dusting is a real possibility, especially in shaded spots.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is pushing into the moderate zone due to ozone. If your lungs are sensitive, you'll feel this one.
*   **Construction Shuffle:** Parts of our city are a perpetual construction zone, and you might find your usual routes blocked or detoured.

## The Chilly Truth About Today's Run

Don't let that clear sky fool you, it's a cold one out there, clocking in at -3°C (27°F). We're looking at cloudy skies during the day, clearing up tonight, with only a slim chance of a few flakes. This isn't exactly prime running weather unless you've got your winter gear dialed in.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| General     | Low   |

Good news for your sinuses, folks. Pollen is staying out of the picture today.

### Air Quality Check

The Air Quality Index is at 72, with Ozone being the dominant pollutant. This puts us in the moderate category. For most of you, it's probably fine, but if you're asthmatic or have other respiratory issues, you might notice some irritation. Maybe dial back the intensity or stick to an indoor track if you're particularly sensitive.

### Watch Your Step: Ice and Construction Ahead
Even with clear skies, those frigid temperatures mean any melted snow from earlier in the week can re-freeze, turning sidewalks and trails into a skater's paradise. Pavement in Rochester is notoriously rough thanks to our lovely freeze-thaw cycles, creating tripping hazards even on a good day. Keep an eye out for black ice, especially on shaded paths and bridges.

Speaking of rough, construction is still chugging along. The City of Rochester announced planned bridge closures for 2026, though many aren't immediate. However, today specifically, Rochester Neck Road is reduced to one lane until 2:00 PM for sewer repair, which will definitely impact any road running or cycling in that area.

If you're hitting the **Genesee River Trail**, be aware that sections between Violetta Street and South Plymouth Avenue might still experience temporary closures or increased construction traffic due to the Vacuum Oil Brownfield Cleanup Projects. While one section near 5 Flint Street reopened in December, it's still a good idea to factor in potential detours or extra vigilance. Don't assume your usual route is clear; stay alert for unexpected barriers or flaggers. The Empire State Trail also has ongoing repairs and potential impacts, so if you're out that way, be ready for temporary shifts or un-signed detours.

### Gear Up, Smart Runner
This isn't the day for shorts and a t-shirt, even if the sun's out. Layer up with moisture-wicking fabrics, cover exposed skin, and wear good traction shoes. A hat, gloves, and a neck gaiter aren't optional; they're essential. Your lungs will thank you for covering your mouth and nose from that cold, dry air.

Stay safe out there, Rochester. Don't be a hero; be smart.
