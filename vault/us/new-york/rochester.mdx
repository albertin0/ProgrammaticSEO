Alright, Rochester, February 28th. Today's a day for selective enthusiasm if you're hitting the pavement or trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   Mild temperatures are a trap; watch out for sneaky ice patches, especially in shaded spots or where that trace of snow lingered.
*   Your lungs won't hate you, but they won't love you either with that moderate ozone.
*   Construction is the unofficial state bird of Rochester, and it's active along many of our favorite routes.

## The Rundown

The weather data says 4.7°C and clear skies, which sounds like a win after a long winter, but don't let it fool you. While the sun might be out, Rochester saw a dusting of snow yesterday, February 27th. That means any untreated path or shady corner could be a black ice ambush waiting to send your joints straight to my PT office. Consider that a hard truth from someone who's seen it all.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Ice, Folks!
Even with above-freezing temps, recent trace snow and refrozen melt can create hazardous black ice, especially on untreated sidewalks, bridges, and shaded sections of trails. Assume it's there until proven otherwise.
</AlertBox>

On the air quality front, we're sitting at an AQI of 68 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's "Moderate," which, translated from bureaucraticspeak, means it's not actively trying to kill you, but it's not doing you any favors either. If you're sensitive, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to shorter bursts outside.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Low pollen is about the only thing giving your lungs a break today. Enjoy it while it lasts; spring will betray us all soon enough with seasonal allergies.

## The Real Hazard: Construction Chaos

Now for the main event: Rochester's ongoing transformation. The city is a perpetual construction zone, and today is no different. The Monroe County Highway & Bridge Program was updated just yesterday, listing ongoing and future projects. Specifically, if you're planning a run on the **Genesee Riverway Trail**, be advised that the "ROC the Riverway" initiative has multiple projects affecting the corridor. While the Vacuum Oil Brownfield Cleanup area (between Violetta Street and South Plymouth Avenue) reportedly reopened in December 2025, increased construction traffic in the vicinity is a given.

Further complicating matters, the Genesee Crossroads Park revitalization and ROC City Skatepark expansion are underway, with "enhanced connections" to the Riverway Trail. What "enhanced connections" often means for runners is "detours, rough patches, and confusing signage." Trust me, plan your route with flexibility.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Genesee Riverway Trail Interruptions
Ongoing ROC the Riverway construction projects, particularly around Genesee Crossroads Park, mean sections of the Genesee Riverway Trail may have unannounced closures, detours, or uneven surfaces. Stay alert for heavy equipment and heed all posted signs.

Finally, if you're hitting any main routes downtown or near local parks, remember it's February 28th. The "Cereal Bowl 5K - Polar Cats Bowl Series #4" is happening today in Rochester. Expect more foot traffic and potential minor road impacts around the race route. Be courteous, be aware, and don't be "that guy" yelling at a race volunteer because your usual path is temporarily occupied.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Race Day Etiquette
The Cereal Bowl 5K is happening today. If your planned route intersects with a race course, expect larger crowds and some temporary reroutes. Be respectful of participants and race staff.
</AlertBox>

So, go run. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the ice, the ozone, and the orange cones.
