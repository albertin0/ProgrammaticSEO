Rochester, you want to run today? Fine. Just don't come crying to me about your lungs or your knees.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
  - That AQI is sitting at 74, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. "Moderate" for healthy folks, but if you're sensitive, you might feel it. Don't push it.
  - It's a brisk -2.7°C (that's about 27°F for the Fahrenheit crowd) and it *feels* colder. Your joints are going to hate you if you don't warm up properly. And seriously, watch for ice.
  - Low pollen count, so at least your sinuses might get a break today.
</BulletList>

Look, the sky's clear, which is a nice change from the gray we usually get, but don't let that fool you. It's still winter, and Rochester has a way of reminding you. The real issue is that pesky AQI. While "moderate" sounds okay on paper, a dominant pollutant like Ozone means if you're prone to respiratory issues, that run along the Genesee Riverway Trail might leave you wheezing more than usual. The experts at AccuWeather are even calling today's air quality "poor" and unhealthy for sensitive groups, advising reduced time outside. That's not just some corporate blogger trying to scare you; that's actual advice from people who know what they're talking about.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Trees       | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Weeds       | Low   |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Watch Your Step:** Monroe County DOT has an interactive map of ongoing construction, and while some major closures for the Erie Canalway Trail/Empire State Trail between Mount Hope Avenue and Scottsville Road might have wrapped up in January, "minor items such as lighting" often linger. Also, parts of the Genesee Riverway Trail near Flint Street and South Plymouth Avenue were subject to temporary closures for cleanup projects, and while the trail itself might be open now, parking restrictions could still be in effect. Don't assume smooth sailing everywhere, especially if you're taking a less-traveled route.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Wind Chill is No Joke:** Even though the temperature is hovering around freezing, the wind chill today makes it feel more like 13-19°F. Exposed skin can get frostbite faster than you think. Layers are your friend. And don't forget good gloves and a hat – nobody needs frozen ears or fingers. If you're near any open water, remember there's a Small Craft Advisory out, which tells you a bit about how blustery it is. That wind isn't just for the boats; it'll cut right through you on land.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Hydrate, Even in the Cold:** Just because you're not sweating buckets doesn't mean you don't need water. Cold weather can mask dehydration. Keep sipping before, during, and after your workout. And maybe consider a warm drink for after; you've earned it (or at least, survived it).
</AlertBox>

So, if you're heading out, bundle up, watch the air, and keep an eye out for construction zones or icy patches that Mother Nature, or our city's never-ending infrastructure projects, might throw your way.
