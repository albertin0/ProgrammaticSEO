It's a deceptively crisp morning in Yonkers today; don't let those clear skies trick you into thinking it's a walk in the park for your workout.

<BulletList>
*   It's a frosty -2°C out there, and while the sun's shining, that recent blizzard likely left plenty of black ice lurking on shaded paths and side streets. Don't be a hero and end up with a sprained ankle.
*   Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 59, with Nitrogen Dioxide as the main culprit. AccuWeather even calls it "Poor" for sensitive groups, with NO2 levels being a concern. For those of us with respiratory sensitivities, that's enough to feel it if you're sucking wind on a hard interval session.
*   On the bright side, pollen is in the basement. No snot rockets from seasonal allergies today, at least.

## The Cold, Hard Truth About Yonkers Trails

Look, I love hitting the Yonkers Greenway as much as the next runner, but today requires some serious caution. We just got hammered by a major blizzard mere days ago, causing travel bans and requiring DPW crews to work around the clock clearing roads. While the main roads might be mostly clear, smaller paths, sidewalks, and especially those charming, shaded sections of the Greenway are probably still holding onto a good amount of ice and compacted snow. A clear day doesn't magically melt away hazards from a foot of snow overnight.

That -2°C temperature means any melted patches from yesterday will refreeze into slick, invisible death traps. Your joints will thank you for taking it easy, or better yet, opting for a treadmill if you're planning any serious speedwork. A slip on the ice is a quick trip to my office (as a PT, not your running buddy).

### Air Quality: Breathe Easy (Sort Of)

The "Moderate" AQI isn't terrible, but it's not "Good" either, and Nitrogen Dioxide is the dominant pollutant. This is typical for an urban area, but for anyone with asthma or other respiratory issues, or if you're just pushing your lungs to their max, it's worth considering. You're trying to improve your health, not accidentally irritate your airways. Some sources suggest this level is "unhealthy for sensitive groups." Keep that in mind, especially if you're contemplating a long run.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Beware of Black Ice:** Despite clear skies, residual moisture from the recent blizzard combined with freezing temperatures (currently -2°C) means black ice is a significant hazard, particularly on shaded sections of trails like the Yonkers Greenway, sidewalks, and less-trafficked routes. Slow down and watch your footing.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Moderate AQI for Sensitive Lungs:** With an AQI of 59 and Nitrogen Dioxide as the dominant pollutant, individuals with respiratory sensitivities should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. It's not a full lockdown, but be mindful of how your lungs feel.
