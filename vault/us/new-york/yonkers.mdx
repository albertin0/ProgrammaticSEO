If you're looking for a pristine winter wonderland run, today ain't it, chief.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air's a bit thicker than ideal.** We've got an AQI of 75, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While not catastrophic, it’s not exactly fresh mountain air for your lungs.
*   **Icy remnants are lurking.** Just because the sun's out doesn't mean those stubborn patches of ice from the blizzard earlier this week have magically vanished. Especially in the shade, those sidewalks and trails are still traps.
*   **Construction chaos continues.** Good luck navigating certain areas if you prefer a smooth, uninterrupted path.
</BulletList>

Alright, Yonkers, let's talk turkey. Today, February 26th, is one of those "choose your poison" kind of days for outdoor workouts. The skies are clear and the temperature's a relatively balmy 5°C (41°F) after the mess we had earlier this week. You might be tempted to ditch the treadmill and hit the pavement, but hold your horses. This isn't a straightforward "go" day.

For your lungs, we're sitting at a "Moderate" Air Quality Index of 75, with ozone making its presence known. If you're sensitive to that kind of thing, or you're planning a high-intensity session, you might feel it. It's not the apocalypse, but it's certainly not peak performance breathing. Keep an eye on how you feel; if you're hacking up a lung after a mile, maybe scale it back.

### Mind the Air
With an AQI of 75 and ozone as the main culprit, those with respiratory issues or sensitive airways might find today's air quality a bit irritating. Listen to your body and consider adjusting your intensity or duration.

Now, for your joints – this is where things get tricky. We just got hammered by a blizzard that saw the Mayor declaring a state of emergency just days ago. While the main roads have been cleared (mostly), and alternate side parking resumed yesterday to help the DPW crews finish the job, don't be fooled. Those charming little side streets, unplowed paths, and anything under a tree or building is still a potential ice rink. Road crews were still working on slippery conditions yesterday. One wrong step on a hidden sheet of black ice, and you'll be spending more time with me in physical therapy than on the trails. Save your ankles. Stick to known clear paths, if you can find any.

Speaking of finding paths, if you were planning to jog around the Cross County Center, be aware that Marx Realty has just kicked off construction on a massive retail expansion and a new 4-acre park. This isn't just a little touch-up; they're building two new structures, underground parking, and upgrading infrastructure. So, if your usual route takes you through that area, expect detours, heavy machinery, and general construction zone shenanigans. It's not exactly zen for your run.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Ice Is Still a Four-Letter Word
Despite the clear weather, expect treacherous icy patches, especially in shaded areas, on sidewalks, and unpaved trails throughout Yonkers. A travel ban was in effect just days ago due to a major blizzard, and while plows have been out, hidden ice is a real hazard for falls and joint injuries.

Overall, today's an okay day if you're smart about it. Dress in layers for the cool but clear weather, pick your routes carefully to avoid ice, and maybe skip that PR attempt if your lungs feel iffy. Your body will thank you.
