You might see a clear sky over Yonkers today, but don't let that fool you; the hangover from the "Blizzard of '26" is still very real for anyone planning to hit the pavement.

<BulletList>
*   **Icy, Icy Baby:** Even with the sun making a cameo, temperatures are just barely above freezing (0.5°C). What melted yesterday will have refrozen into black ice nightmares on sidewalks and shaded paths overnight. Your ankles will thank you for choosing traction over speed.
*   **Chilly Air:** While the travel bans have been lifted since Monday, and alternate side parking is only just resuming today after being suspended, it means crews have been focused on main arteries. Don't expect your favorite side streets or the quieter stretches of the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail to be perfectly clear. Dress in layers, folks.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is clocking in at 58, which is "moderate" for fine particulate matter. It's not a lungbuster, but it's not pristine, especially if you're pushing hard.

### Today's Environmental Rundown

| Pollutant          | Level     | AQI  | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------------- | :-------- | :--- | :----------------- |
| Pollen             | Low       | N/A  | N/A                |
| Air Quality Index  | Moderate  | 58   | Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Black Ice Alert!** Seriously, watch your step. Areas that got wet yesterday will be treacherous this morning. Think shady spots, underpasses, and less-trafficked pathways along the Saw Mill River Parkway. One wrong step and you'll be having an unscheduled chat with a physical therapist (like me), and trust me, you don't want that.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Road Conditions Still Sketchy.** While the major snow emergency regulations were largely lifted yesterday, residual snow piles and icy patches will persist, particularly off the main roads. If you're running on the streets, assume the worst and stay vigilant for slick spots.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Buttercup.** It's clear, but it's still cold. Wind chill will make that 0.5°C feel even colder. A good base layer, a mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell are your friends. Don't forget gloves and a hat – you lose a lot of heat from your head and extremities.
</AlertBox>

Look, the "Blizzard of '26" was a decent one, and while the city's digging out, not everything's going to be pristine. If you're heading out, prioritize safety over setting any PRs. Stick to known clear routes, or consider an indoor alternative if you're not confident in your footing. Your body will thank you for not ending up in the ER.
