Today, the weather in Cincinnati is playing a cruel trick, luring you outside with clear skies only to ambush your lungs and potentially your joints.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is a Kick to the Lungs:** While it looks pretty, the air quality today is rated "Poor" and "Unhealthy for sensitive groups" due to elevated ozone levels. Don't let that crisp air fool you; it's got some extra ingredients your respiratory system doesn't need.
*   **Icy Surprises Lurking:** We got a dusting of snow this morning, which might have mostly melted, but as temperatures dip tonight, expect patchy ice to form, especially on bridges and in shaded areas. That's a recipe for a bad fall.
*   **Trail Closures Abound:** Between ongoing construction and lingering wet conditions, several of our favorite spots are a no-go, or at least a 'proceed with extreme caution.'
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The sun's out, and that's a rare treat in late February. You want to lace up and hit the pavement or the trails. But let's be real about what you're stepping into. That clear sky is hiding an Air Quality Index that AccuWeather is calling "Poor," warning sensitive groups to reduce their time outside. If you've got asthma or any other respiratory issues, seriously, reconsider that long run. Even if you don't, prolonged exertion out there today could leave you feeling rougher than usual. Your lungs are working hard enough without breathing in elevated levels of ozone.

### Hazards on the Homefront

The brief snowfall this morning on February 26th might have given way to milder afternoon temperatures around 6.9°C (44°F), melting some of the white stuff. But don't get complacent. Tonight, when that mercury drops again, all that melted snow is going to freeze right back up. We're talking patchy ice, folks. Bridges, shaded spots, any pavement that didn't fully dry out – those are prime locations for a nasty slip. Don't be that runner explaining a sprained ankle to your boss because you underestimated a seemingly dry sidewalk.

### Watch Your Step: Icy Patches Expected Overnight!
After today's melt, refreezing will create slick spots on roads, bridges, and trails as evening temperatures drop. Exercise extreme caution.

Then there's the ongoing saga of local construction and trail conditions. If you were planning a bike ride along the Little Miami Scenic Corridor, forget about it at Bass Island. Improvements are underway through summer 2026, and the parking lot and river access are shut down. Same goes for the mountain bike trails at Mitchell Memorial Forest; they're closed due to wet conditions, and frankly, if they say wet, they mean "mud pit."

Even our beloved Cincinnati Parks have issues. A lower portion of the Bard Owl Trail in Burnet Woods is currently closed due to significant sinkholes. Yeah, sinkholes. That's a "nope" from me. And don't even get me started on the Brent Spence Bridge Corridor Project. It's a behemoth that's going to mess with downtown travel for years, with major construction really kicking off this spring. Pete Rose Way is going to see "more extensive lane closures" in early March for external demolition, so good luck finding a clear path if you run that way.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail Closures: Heed the Signs or Risk Injury!
Specific trails like the lower Bard Owl Trail in Burnet Woods (due to sinkholes) and the mountain bike trails at Mitchell Memorial Forest (wet conditions) are closed. Avoid these areas.

So, what's a dedicated runner to do? Treadmill. Indoor track. Or, if you absolutely *must* be outside, keep it short, stick to well-lit, familiar, and highly trafficked areas that are less likely to have hidden ice, and seriously consider wearing a mask if the air quality feels iffy to you, despite the "clear" skies. Your lungs and joints will thank you.
