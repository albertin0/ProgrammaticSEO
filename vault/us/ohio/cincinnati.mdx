Alright, Cincinnati, if you managed to get out for a run this morning, you're either dedicated or didn't check the forecast because it was a bit of a mess.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Yesterday's spring-like weather played a cruel joke, dumping unexpected snow and turning things slick this morning as temps plummeted.
*   Air quality is sitting at a "Moderate" 79 AQI with ozone as the main player, so if you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel it.
*   Construction around the city and certain trail closures mean your usual routes might be interrupted or require extra caution.

### The Morning's Nasty Surprise & Tonight's Sneaky Threat

If you were out at dawn, you know. Light snow and near-freezing temperatures made surfaces, especially elevated ones and bridges, pretty slick. Temps dropped to about 30 degrees at daybreak, so running outside required some serious caution against slipping on that "minor accumulation" we saw on the grass and elevated bits. Even AccuWeather had a Special Weather Statement out until 8:30 AM.

The good news is, by afternoon, things warmed up to nearly 50 degrees, melting most of that brief winter wonderland. But don't get complacent. Tonight, with clear skies and temperatures dipping back to around 31 degrees, any lingering moisture is primed for refreezing. That means patchy ice, particularly on bridges and in shaded areas. Seriously, watch your step, especially near dawn tomorrow on bridges like those crossing the Little Miami River if you're out on the trails.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Black Ice Alert for Tonight and Early Morning!** With temperatures dropping below freezing again after today's melt, watch out for sneaky black ice on untreated surfaces, especially bridges and shaded spots. A fall on ice is no joke and can lead to anything from a nasty bruise to a trip to the orthopedic surgeon.

### Your Lungs Aren't Getting a Gold Star Today

That AQI of 79 isn't "terrible," but it's not "great" either. "Moderate" air quality means some folks, especially those with unusual sensitivities to ozone, might experience respiratory symptoms. If you're planning a long, hard effort, maybe dial it back or stick to an indoor track if your lungs usually complain. It's not a lung-buster, but it's certainly not doing you any favors.

### Trail Updates & Perpetual Construction Chaos

Our beloved local trails are still feeling the squeeze from Mother Nature and perpetual construction.

The **Mitchell Mountain Bike Trail** at Mitchell Memorial Forest has been closed for a while now due to wet conditions. If you were planning on hitting those singletracks, you're out of luck. Same goes for the Shawnee Lookout Boat Ramp due to high water – though that's more for the paddlers than the pavement pounders.

Around **Sharon Woods**, construction for the Sharon Woods Drive Bridge Stream and Sanitary Sewer Modification Project is ongoing through spring. The bridge itself is open, but a section of the nearby trail is detoured onto the park road. You'll likely encounter construction vehicles, so stay alert. Also, **Buckeye Falls Drive** could have intermittent closures through February for dredging and trail work.

On a larger scale, the city is a construction zone, as usual. The massive **Brent Spence Bridge Corridor project** is slated for major construction this year, with preliminary work already underway. While it's not directly blocking your favorite trail *today*, it means more traffic headaches and an overall less pleasant urban running experience in the surrounding areas for the foreseeable future. There are also bike lane closures on the Blair Avenue/I-71 Bridge Repair until June.

**Always Check Before You Go:** For trails, especially after any rain or melt/freeze cycles, check the Great Parks of Hamilton County website for real-time closures. For city running, be aware of ongoing construction downtown and near major thoroughfares.
