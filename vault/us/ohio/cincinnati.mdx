Alright, Cincinnati, if you squint past the moderate ozone and know your local closures, today's not half bad for a late February romp outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Low pollen count is a win for anyone who usually struggles with early spring sniffles. Get out there and breathe easy, relatively speaking.
*   Moderate ozone levels mean you might feel it in your lungs if you're pushing hard; probably not the day for an all-out sprint down the Lunken Airport Trail. Take it down a notch.
*   Local trail closures and ongoing construction are still a pain in the neck, so check before you head out, especially if you have a specific route in mind.

### Today's Environmental Breakdown

| Pollen Level | AQI (Dominant Pollutant) | Temperature (°C) | Condition |
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :--------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 74 (Ozone)               | 7.9              | Clear     |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert: Moderate AQI Means Take It Easy.**
With an AQI of 74 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, your lungs might not be thrilled with high-intensity workouts. If you're sensitive, or if you're planning a long run, consider scaling back or opting for an indoor session. You don't want to feel like you're sucking air through a coffee stirrer just because you ignored the forecast.

The good news? It's clear out there, and temperatures are hitting a balmy 7.9°C, warming up even further into the mid-teens later today. That's practically paradise after the frosty February we've had. But don't get too complacent. While Thursday saw some light snow and patchy ice, today's sun should have cleared most of that nonsense. Still, if you're hitting shaded trails or bridges early, keep an eye out for sneaky icy spots. Nobody wants an unplanned face-plant because they underestimated a rogue patch of frozen water.

### Local Trail Headaches and Happenings

Here's where things get a bit more "Cincinnati in late winter." While many of our beloved parks are shaking off the cold, some spots are still a mess.

The **Mitchell Mountain Bike Trail** at Mitchell Memorial Forest? Still shut down as of February 13th due to wet conditions. Seriously, respect the closures. If a trail is closed for wet conditions, riding it just tears it up worse for everyone else later. Go find some pavement or hit a different park.

Meanwhile, **Sharon Woods** is a bit of a maze right now. The **Sharon Woods Drive Bridge Area** has ongoing construction, meaning detours and heavy equipment in the vicinity. Plus, sections of **Buckeye Falls Drive** are seeing intermittent closures through February for dredge and trail construction. Oh, and the **Kreis Dam** remains completely off-limits to pedestrians. If you're planning a loop in Sharon Woods, prepare for some rerouting and potential bottlenecks. It's like they're actively trying to make you frustrated, but hey, eventually, it'll be better.

**Don't Forget About Planned Events!**
If you're looking for some guided outdoor activity, Cincinnati Parks + Rec is hosting a Winter Hiking w/ be.well event at Mt. Airy Forest today. Or, if urban exploration is more your speed, there's a Cincy Hikes Urban Hike in the East End this afternoon. Always good to see what's officially happening if you're tired of solo laps.
