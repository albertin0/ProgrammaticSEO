Today's weather is playing a cruel trick, luring you outside with decent temps while Dayton's construction crews and invisible pollutants try their best to trip you up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That 7.8°C (46°F) "clear" weather feels like a gift in late February, but don't let it fool you entirely.
*   Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a moderate 71, with Ozone as the main culprit. If your lungs are finicky, you might feel this one.
*   Construction is *everywhere* and has been for a while, turning routine routes into obstacle courses.
</BulletList>

Look, the temperature is finally above freezing, the sun's out, and your motivation is probably peaking after another gray Ohio winter. I get it. The good news is, pollen is low. If you're generally robust, a run or ride is doable, but you need to run your route, not just your mouth, today.

The real buzzkill, besides the ever-present Ohio River Valley ozone, is the sheer amount of ongoing construction across the city. ODOT isn't messing around, and neither is the city's Public Works. If your usual circuit involves anything near **I-75 between SR 4 and Needmore Road**, you already know the drill: major reconstruction, traffic shifts, lane restrictions, and ramp closures. Northbound lanes are playing hopscotch with contraflow setups, meaning you're probably breathing more exhaust than usual if you're road-running or cycling nearby. Same goes for **Woodman Drive** and the start of the **Salem Avenue reconstruction**. It's not just car traffic; it means noise, detours, and sometimes, less-than-ideal pedestrian or bike paths.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Zone Chaos:** Major projects on I-75, Woodman Drive, and upcoming work on Salem Avenue mean increased vehicle traffic, uneven surfaces, and potential detours on or near popular routes. Keep your head on a swivel.

Then there's the air. A moderate AQI of 71, with ozone as the dominant pollutant, means sensitive groups might experience some discomfort. While it's not "stay indoors" bad, it's not "take a deep breath and feel refreshed" good either. If you have asthma or other respiratory issues, consider dialing back the intensity or sticking to indoor workouts.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert (Moderate):** AQI is 71 due to Ozone. If you're prone to respiratory issues, keep your outdoor exertion moderate.
</AlertBox>

Finally, let's talk about the ground beneath your feet. While today is clear, we've had some wet weather recently, and local news was reporting on flash flood warnings and a school closure due to flooding earlier this week (Feb 22, 2026) in nearby New Carlisle. Even if the **Great Miami River trails** aren't actively submerged today, those receding floodwaters leave behind sediment that turns into a slick, ankle-twisting mess. Tread carefully.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Trail Conditions Check:** Recent heavy rains and local flooding (even if not active today) mean trails, especially those along riverbanks like the Great Miami, could have slippery mud, debris, or lingering wet spots. Watch your step and wear appropriate footwear.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're heading out, be smart. Plan routes away from the main road construction, listen to your lungs, and assume any trail you hit might still be a muddy, slippery beast.
