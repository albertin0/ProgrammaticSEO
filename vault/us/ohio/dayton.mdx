Alright, Dayton, it's clear out there, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a perfect day to PR; the ground's cold, and the construction never sleeps.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is moderate at an AQI of 74, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not terrible, but definitely not "crisp." Your lungs might notice it more than usual if you're pushing hard.</li>
  <li>It's barely above freezing at 0.8°C. While "clear" sounds nice, those cold temps can make your joints stiff and increase the risk of pulling something if you don't warm up properly. And seriously, watch for black ice on those shady patches, especially around dawn.</li>
  <li>Construction is still the unofficial state bird of Dayton. There are ongoing projects all over, impacting everything from major interstates to pedestrian paths. If your route takes you anywhere near the I-75 reconstruction between Needmore Road and Leo Street, expect lane shifts and ramp closures that could mess with your flow.</li>
</BulletList>

<AlertBox type="warning">
  The air quality is "Moderate" today due to ozone. If you're sensitive or planning a high-intensity workout, consider adjusting your pace or duration. It's not a full-on lung burner, but it's not ideal.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  Temperatures are hovering just above freezing. Be extremely cautious of icy spots, especially on less-trafficked paths or shaded areas. A seemingly clear patch could still hide treacherous black ice, and nobody wants a twisted ankle on the Great Miami River Trail.

### Construction Zone Chaos

Look, I get it. We're a city in perpetual motion, but sometimes it feels like every single road and trail is under siege. Beyond the current chill, the real long-term hazard for runners and cyclists is the sheer volume of ongoing construction. You'd think they'd coordinate these things, but nope.

For instance, the Ohio-To-Erie Trail has had intermittent closures and detours. Always check before you head out, because getting rerouted onto a busy road mid-run is a special kind of awful. Then there's the ongoing pedestrian and bicycle facility construction along U.S. 68 near the Great Council State Park education center. You might encounter flaggers, or even temporary closures, which are not conducive to finding your rhythm.

Even if you're sticking to city streets, the Woodman Drive lane closures between U.S. 35 and Sunberry Drive are reducing traffic to one lane in each direction, and they're reconstructing the roadway until August 2026. That means less space and more distracted drivers. Keep your head on a swivel.

<AlertBox type="info">
  Dress in layers, even if it looks "clear." The initial chill will hit hard, but you'll warm up. A light jacket, long sleeves, gloves, and a hat are your friends. And seriously, reflective gear isn't just for night runs when you're dodging traffic shifts on Woodman.
</AlertBox>

Honestly, today isn't the worst, but it's far from perfect. Be smart, stay visible, and maybe hit the treadmill if you're feeling extra cautious about those cold-weather slips and the air.
