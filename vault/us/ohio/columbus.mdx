Alright Columbus, if you're looking to get those miles in today, February 26th, bundle up, because it's a cold one, but at least the skies are clear.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   It's clear and sunny, which is a nice mental boost, but the air temperature is below freezing.
*   AQI is in the moderate range due to ozone, so if your lungs are finicky, take note.
*   Pollen count is blessedly low, a win for allergy sufferers.
</BulletList>

## Today's Lowdown: Frosty Air, Moderate Air, and Persistent Potholes

Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it: it's 30°F (-1°C) out there, feeling more like 25°F (-4°C). That's not exactly shorts weather, even for the most hardened of us. You're going to need layers, people. Think base layer, mid-layer, and a wind-resistant shell. Don't forget the gloves, hat, and possibly a neck gaiter. Hypothermia is a real buzzkill for your splits.

### Air Quality Check

Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 74 today, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Now, 74 isn't "stay indoors and hermetically seal your windows" bad, but it's not "take a deep breath and feel invigorated" good either. If you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally cranky lungs, consider dialling back the intensity of your workout. MORPC usually issues alerts when the AQI hits 101 or higher, so we're under that, but sensitive groups should still exercise caution. Particle pollution (PM2.5) can also build up overnight when it's cold and air is trapped close to the ground, so keep that in mind if you're an early riser.

### Construction Chaos Continues

It wouldn't be Columbus without some construction, right? Downtown, the "Capital Line" project on East Gay Street is still chugging along. Currently, they're in Stage 2 (February-June 2026), relocating underground utilities. While sidewalks are generally expected to remain accessible, you might hit some partial street closures or detours if you're running near this stretch connecting to places like the Scioto Mile. Keep your head up and stay aware of your surroundings, because construction workers are often not looking out for you, the runner.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step, Downtowners:** The Capital Line construction on East Gay Street means you need to be extra vigilant for uneven surfaces, equipment, and potential detours, especially if you're trying to hit the Scioto Mile trails. Keep those earbuds low.
</AlertBox>

Beyond downtown, several parks are undergoing improvements. Albany Crossing, Easthaven, Griggs Park, Saunders Park, and Williams Creek Park all have ongoing construction impacting playgrounds, boat hoists, or fitness circuits. While the full parks aren't shut down, expect closures in immediate work areas. If you're out on the Big Walnut Trail, be aware that a significant extension is underway, which means heavy machinery and changed conditions in sections between Winchester Pike and East Main Street, potentially lasting through the year.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Buttercup:** With temperatures hovering just below freezing and feeling even colder, proper layering is crucial to avoid frostbite and stay comfortable. Wind chill is no joke.
</AlertBox>

Good news on other fronts: we're not dealing with any major flooding, significant wind warnings, or fresh snow emergencies today. The trails should be mostly clear of fresh snow, though icy patches could definitely still be lurking in shaded areas from previous snowfall.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Black Ice Alert:** Despite clear conditions, residual moisture from earlier in the week and freezing temperatures mean black ice is a very real threat, especially on bridges, shaded paths, and less-traveled routes. Assume every damp patch is ice.
</AlertBox>

So, get out there if you want, but be smart about it. Dress for the cold, keep an eye on your breathing with the moderate AQI, and be alert to construction zones. No heroics needed, just common sense.
