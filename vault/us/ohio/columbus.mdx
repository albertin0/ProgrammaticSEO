Alright, Columbus, today is shaping up to be a pretty solid day to finally get those miles in without fighting a blizzard or sweltering humidity.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   That early morning chill is burning off, leaving clear skies and a welcome sun for your afternoon workout.
*   Pollen levels are practically non-existent, so your allergies won't be staging a hostile takeover mid-run.
*   Just watch out for some localized construction around parks – typical Columbus, always building something.
</BulletList>

The weather today is actually playing nice. We're looking at a high around 4.2°C (that's about 39.5°F for those still stuck in Fahrenheit), with whatever scattered flurries we had this morning now largely out of here. You'll get some actual sunshine building through the day, so grab that thermal layer but don't expect to freeze your digits off. The good news continues into Friday and Saturday, which are forecasted to be even warmer and sunnier, if you're planning ahead. Just be aware, Sunday night into Monday morning, we're looking at another round of potential snow that could make for a messy start to next week.

Here's the lowdown on what's in the air and what's on the ground:

### Environmental Breakdown

| Metric                     | Status          | Notes                                     |
| :------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **Pollen Level**           | Low             | Breathe easy, allergy sufferers.          |
| **Air Quality Index (AQI)** | 65 (Moderate)   | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) |
| **Temperature**            | 4.2°C (39.5°F)  | Chilly but clear                          |

<AlertBox type="warning">
### AQI: Moderate Particulates
While the AQI of 65 isn't "dangerously high," the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter. If you've got asthma, COPD, or just particularly sensitive lungs, you might feel it. Keep your routes away from heavy traffic areas if possible, or consider sticking to indoor cardio today.

### Mind Your Surroundings: Local Construction
The Columbus Recreation and Parks Department has a few ongoing projects. For instance, if you're typically launching your kayak or enjoying the waterside views at **Griggs Reservoir Park**, note that the old boat hoist is being removed for a new adaptive kayak launch until June 30, 2026. The immediate construction area will be closed, but the rest of the park and its amenities should be accessible. The same goes for O'Shaughnessy Reservoir. Additionally, watch for playground construction at Albany Crossing Park and Easthaven Park, where sections are closed. Even Blacklick Trail might have some AEP equipment activity and flaggers as they clear powerline easements, mainly on weekdays, so stay alert if you're in that area. These aren't full trail closures, but don't get so zoned out on your podcast that you miss a detour or a construction barrier.

Overall, it's a respectable day to get outside in Columbus. Just be smart about where you're going, give construction crews their space, and listen to your body, especially if those particulates are bugging your lungs. Don't go pretending it's July; dress for the chilly clear weather.
