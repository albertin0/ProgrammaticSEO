Alright, Columbus, look, it's not the worst day to hit the pavement, but you better be paying attention.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

### Why today is a "proceed with caution" kind of day:

<BulletList>
*   It's a brisk one out there, and while it's clear right now, temperatures are diving tonight, bringing a real chance of icy patches by morning. Your joints will thank you for warming up properly.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 66, thanks to ozone. Not a deal-breaker for most, but if your lungs are finicky, consider dialing back that interval session.
*   Construction season never truly ends in this city, and a lot of our beloved green spaces are impacted. Plan your route carefully to avoid detours and potential hazards.
</BulletList>

Today's the kind of day where you can probably get your miles in without major drama, but don't get complacent. We're staring down 8.3°C (around 47°F-50°F) and clear skies, which sounds idyllic, but that mercury is dropping fast once the sun goes down, possibly hitting -2°C (28°F) with a light dusting of snow expected overnight. That means any moisture on the ground could turn into black ice quicker than you can say "sprained ankle."

### Watch Your Step: Freezing Temps Tonight
With temperatures expected to dip below freezing and a slight chance of light snow, watch for icy spots, especially on shaded paths, bridges, and overpasses, come evening and early morning. Your favorite stretch of the Olentangy Trail could be slick.

Let's talk about our ever-evolving infrastructure. The Columbus Recreation and Parks Department has a laundry list of ongoing projects. For example, if you usually head to **Griggs Reservoir Park**, remember that the old boat hoist is being replaced with a new kayak launch through June 2026, and the immediate construction area is off-limits. Plus, the Trabue-Murphy boat ramp is closed indefinitely due to unstable conditions. Don't be "that guy" trying to sneak through a closed-off zone. It’s closed for a reason.

And speaking of construction, keep an eye on upcoming major projects. The Capital Line project downtown, a pedestrian and bike pathway, has phases kicking off, with the Gay Street portion expected to start construction by late summer 2025. Also, several LinkUS bike and pedestrian projects, including a significant segment of the **Big Walnut Trail** between Winchester Pike and Refugee Road, are scheduled to begin construction in 2026. While not immediate hazards for today, know that your future routes might need adjustments.

Air quality is moderate at an AQI of 66, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. This usually means most people are fine, but if you've got any respiratory issues, it's wise to listen to your body. Maybe don't push for a PR if you're already feeling it in your chest.

### AQI: Moderate (66)
Ozone is the main culprit today. If you're sensitive, consider adjusting your workout intensity or sticking to indoor options.

Now for a public service announcement that isn't directly workout-related, but worth knowing if you've been traveling: the Ohio Department of Health issued a warning about potential measles exposure at John Glenn Columbus International Airport. If you were there between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on February 18th, and you're not vaccinated, be vigilant for symptoms. Just a reminder that sometimes the biggest hazards aren't the ones you can trip over.
