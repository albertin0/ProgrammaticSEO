It's a decent day to get outside in Columbus, just be smart about where you're headed and what you're breathing.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is "Moderate" overall, but watch out for Ozone if you're sensitive.** AccuWeather pegs it as "Poor" for vulnerable groups, so listen to your lungs.
*   **Construction is still a constant companion in our fair city.** Expect closures and detours, especially around parks and major highway arteries.
*   **Temps are mild now, but don't get too comfortable.** A chance of light snow overnight could make your early morning run a slippery affair.
</BulletList>

The sun's out, and honestly, 6.4°C (43.5°F) in late February feels like a gift after the deep freeze. But don't let the clear skies fool you into thinking it's a perfectly pristine day for that long run or ride. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 77, with Ozone being the dominant pollutant. For most of us, that's probably just a minor annoyance, maybe a bit more throat tickle than usual. But if you've got asthma, COPD, or just easily irritated airways, AccuWeather's "Poor" rating for sensitive groups is a legitimate heads-up. Prioritize that easy pace or consider an indoor alternative if you're feeling it. Ground-level ozone, our particular culprit today, loves warm, sunny days with light winds, which sounds a lot like our current forecast.

At least the trees are still mostly asleep.

Now, for the perennial Columbus challenge: construction. The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is keeping us on our toes with ongoing impacts from the I-70/I-71 Downtown Ramp Up project. You'll find several major highway ramps closed for repairs, like I-71 North to I-70 West and I-70 West to I-71 South. While these are primarily for drivers, more cars on surface streets mean you, the runner or cyclist, need to be extra vigilant, especially downtown.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Park and Trail Obstacles Ahead:** The Columbus Recreation and Parks Department has multiple ongoing projects that could impact your outdoor plans. If you frequent spots like Griggs Park or Saunders Park, be prepared for fenced-off areas as they install new adaptive kayak launches and adult fitness circuits. Always respect construction barriers; they're there for your safety, not to annoy you.
</AlertBox>

And speaking of trails, if your route includes the **Columbus Downtown Connector (670 Trail)**, be aware of a side path closure on Leonard Avenue. You technically *can* ride with vehicle traffic on the street to bypass it, but let's be real, that's not anyone's idea of a relaxing workout. Plan your route accordingly, or be ready for an impromptu urban adventure. Next week, beginning Monday, the Heritage Trail through Hilliard will also see AEP crews clearing powerline easements, which might mean flaggers and detours.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Evening & Night Owls, Bundle Up:** While 6.4°C is pretty sweet for late afternoon, the temperature is slated to dip overnight. The forecast calls for a chance of light snow, which could make things slick. If you're heading out after dark or planning an early Sunday run, remember black ice isn't a myth – it's just waiting for you.
</AlertBox>

On the bright side, no current flood warnings for the Scioto River and no blaring severe storm or high wind alerts. So, lace up, Columbus. Just keep an eye on that AQI, navigate those construction zones like a pro, and maybe save the record-breaking speed work for a day when your lungs don't have to work quite so hard.
