Alright, Columbus, today's one of those "take advantage of it while it lasts" kind of days, because we all know what's coming.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lungs:** While pollen is keeping its head down (thank god), the air quality is still hanging out in "moderate" territory, mostly due to those pesky inhalable particulates. You might not feel it, but your lungs are doing extra work.
*   **Joints:** Temperatures are actually pretty decent for a late February run, clearing up nicely after some early morning flurries. Just remember to watch your step; construction is *everywhere*.
*   **Motivation:** Get out there and earn those miles, because Mother Nature is threatening to dump snow on us again by Monday. Don't say I didn't warn you.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe

While your seasonal allergies might be getting a reprieve today, the Air Quality Index for Columbus is sitting at 54, which officially puts us in the "moderate" category. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter. So, while it's not awful, it's also not pristine mountain air.

| Pollen Type | Level |
|---|---|
| Overall | Low |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Particulate Matter Advisory:** AQI is moderate (54) due to inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). If you're sensitive or have respiratory issues, consider keeping your workout moderate today or stick to indoor alternatives. Don't push it.

## Trail Talk & Road Rage

You'd think with the chill we've had, construction crews would take a break, but nope, not in Columbus.

The weather is actually cooperating today, with temperatures around 6.9°C (44°F) and clear skies after some early morning flurries. This makes it a pretty good day to hit the **Scioto Mile**, enjoy the river views, or get some miles in on the multi-use paths. Just be aware of what's happening *around* those paths.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Downtown I-70/I-71 "Ramp Up" Mayhem:** The I-70/I-71 Downtown Ramp Up project continues to chew up our roadways. While the overnight ramp closures on I-71 Northbound to I-70 Westbound and SR 315 are *ending today*, expect ongoing lane restrictions on Front Street over I-70. This whole downtown spaghetti bowl reconstruction means you need to be constantly vigilant for shifting traffic patterns and closed off areas, even for pedestrians and cyclists.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of ongoing headaches, if you're venturing north, **17th Avenue** near the Ohio Expo Center remains entirely closed through April 30, 2026, due to the Expo 2050 construction. Avoid that whole area if you can.

Out west, the **Trabue Road** bridge rehabilitation over the Scioto River means lane reductions (down to two lanes) through Fall 2026. If your run takes you that way, expect congestion and make sure you're visible.

And our beloved Metro Parks aren't immune to the construction bug. Over at **Griggs Reservoir Park**, they're replacing the old boat hoist with a new adaptive kayak launch, so parts of that immediate area are closed until June 30, 2026. The park itself is open, but stay clear of the active work zones. Similarly, on the **Blacklick Trail** between Three Creeks Metro Park and Pickerington Ponds, AEP crews are clearing powerline easements until June 2025. While full closures aren't expected, anticipate equipment near the trail and flaggers on weekdays. Pay attention to those flaggers; they're there for your safety, not just to look pretty.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Looking Ahead - Winter Isn't Over:** While today is relatively mild and clear, don't pack away your winter gear just yet. Forecasts indicate colder temperatures and a chance of snow returning Sunday night into Monday morning, potentially impacting your Monday commute or early week runs. Plan accordingly.
