Don't be a hero today, Toledo. It's a brisk one with some underlying air quality funk that means you should probably dial back the intensity.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Chilly Grind:** We're hovering just above freezing, folks. That 0.3°C temperature means cold muscles, stiff joints, and a real chance of black ice hiding in those shaded corners, especially as evening approaches and the temperature drops to the forecasted "Clear" night. Your wind chill is currently sitting at a lovely 16°F, so dress like you mean it.
*   **Moderate Air, Ozone Focus:** The AQI is clocking in at 79, with Ozone as our dominant pollutant. While it’s technically "Moderate," for anyone with even a hint of respiratory sensitivity – asthma, seasonal allergies, or if you just happen to have lungs – pushing a hard workout out there might leave you wheezing. It's not *terrible*, but it's not ideal for PR attempts either.
*   **Pollen Peace:** At least there's one win. Pollen levels are blessedly low today. So, your sniffles are likely due to the cold, not cedar.

## The Rundown for Toledo Trails

Thinking of hitting the pavement or trails? Here’s what’s up:

### Weather & Conditions

That 0.3°C (33°F) might not sound terrible, but when you're out there, it'll feel colder. Remember those January advisories we had? We're not quite there, but this isn't exactly shorts weather. Think layers, non-cotton, and definitely consider traction on your shoes if you're venturing off main, treated paths. ODOT mentioned last month that they prioritize bridge decks for salting when it's this cold, so be extra cautious on bridges and overpasses on your local routes, even if the general roads seem clear.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Black Ice Alert!** With temperatures just above freezing and clear skies expected tonight, watch for sneaky ice patches, especially on bridges, shaded sections, and any areas where snowmelt might have refrozen. A quick slip can lead to a long recovery.
</AlertBox>

### Air Quality Check

Our AQI of 79, dominated by Ozone, puts us in the "Moderate" category. This means air quality is generally acceptable for most, but if you're part of a sensitive group (kids, older adults, anyone with lung or heart disease), you might experience some minor respiratory irritation, especially with prolonged exertion. Don't push through that cough; listen to your body.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Breathe Smart:** If you're doing an outdoor workout, consider opting for a lower intensity or shorter duration. If you feel any chest tightness, shortness of breath, or persistent coughing, cut it short and head indoors. Your lungs will thank you.

### Local Buzz: Construction & Closures

The City of Toledo is gearing up for its 2026 road construction season, with many projects kicking off in March and running through late fall. While no major Metropark trails are completely shut down *today* due to construction (other than the Mini Maumee Discovery Play area at Glass City Riverwalk, which is closed indefinitely due to mechanical issues), you might encounter some preliminary work or detours in various neighborhoods. If you're planning a run along the Maumee, be aware that sections of White Street Park have active construction and are fenced off for safety. Don't go trying to run through a construction zone just to add a mile to your log.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Construction Zone Confusion:** Be aware that various road construction projects are planned across the city for 2026. While active work might not be in full swing everywhere yet, stay vigilant for new signage, cones, and potential detours on roads like Secor (though its main reconstruction is paused, a barrier for left turns is still planned for early 2026 near Westgate). White Street Park along the Maumee River specifically has fenced-off, active construction areas you need to avoid. Don't assume your usual route is clear.
