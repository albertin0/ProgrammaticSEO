Look, it's February in Toledo, so 8°C and clear skies might feel like a blessing, but don't get too ahead of yourself—it's still Toledo.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   AQI is pushing "moderate" thanks to ozone, so your lungs might feel it more than usual, especially if you're pushing pace.
*   Construction season is already trying to rear its ugly head, with plenty of detours and uneven surfaces to navigate.
*   The temperature is decent for a February run, but the ground might still be unforgiving if you take a tumble.

## The Air: Just Moderate Enough to Annoy You

Today, your lungs are staring down an AQI of 74, with ozone being the main culprit. That puts us squarely in the "moderate" category. For most of you iron-lunged runners, you'll probably just scoff and keep going. But if you're sensitive to air quality, have any underlying respiratory issues, or are planning a particularly long or intense session, you might notice some irritation. Consider toning it down or opting for an indoor session if you feel it's bothering you. Nobody needs to voluntarily huff extra ozone when they're trying to set a new PR.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate AQI: Don't Push It if You're Sensitive
With an AQI of 74 driven by ozone, unusually sensitive individuals should think twice about prolonged outdoor exertion. Listen to your body and adjust your workout accordingly.

## Roadblocks and Rough Patches: Welcome to Construction Season

Just when you thought you could enjoy a clear path, Toledo reminds you it's always under construction. The biggest headache right now is Secor Road between Laskey and Alexis roads, where reconstruction means lane restrictions are sticking around for the next five months. They've shifted traffic to the western side, so expect single lanes and some navigational gymnastics if you're trying to run anywhere near there. Don't be surprised by unexpected detours or sidewalks that abruptly end.

Beyond Secor, the city's got a whole slate of residential and major road projects for 2026 kicking off soon, meaning this isn't an isolated incident. If you're out on the trails around Glass City Metropark, you're probably safe from the immediate road chaos, but always stay vigilant. The Ribbon is still open for skating if you're into that, but for serious mileage, stick to the paths you know aren't currently being torn up.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Construction Chaos on Secor Road
Major reconstruction on Secor Road (between Laskey and Alexis) means lane restrictions and altered traffic patterns. Expect uneven surfaces, narrow passages, and potential sudden detours if your route takes you through or near this area. Prioritize safety over speed.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Pollen levels are currently low, so at least your sinuses aren't fighting you today.

### Mind the Uneven Ground
Even with clear skies, construction sites mean loose gravel, broken pavement, and sudden drops. Keep your eyes peeled and maybe save the trail shoes for your runs through Oak Openings Metropark later in the season.
