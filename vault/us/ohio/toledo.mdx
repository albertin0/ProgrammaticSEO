Today is one of those 'bundle up and deal with it' days for a Toledo workout; certainly runnable, but far from ideal.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are hovering just above freezing at 1.2°C, so you’ll want to layer up properly, especially for any sustained outdoor activity. Don't be a hero in shorts.
*   The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 77, with Ozone being the dominant pollutant. If you've got sensitive lungs, today might not be the day for hitting new PRs or long, deep-breathing runs.
*   There's ongoing construction that kicked off this week on **Secor Road** between Laskey and Alexis roads, restricting traffic to a single lane in each direction. If your route takes you anywhere near there, expect delays and be extra vigilant for construction vehicles and traffic shifts.

Look, it's late February in Toledo. We’re mostly just waiting for spring and trying not to slip on any lingering patches of ice, which thankfully isn't a major concern today with clear skies. But let’s not pretend it’s pleasant. That 1.2°C might feel fine if you're really pushing it, but stand around too long, and you'll quickly remember why we hate winter.

The AQI at 77 isn't terrible, but it's enough to nudge some folks towards the treadmill if their lungs are easily irritated. Ozone can be a real pain, especially if you're doing heavy breathing. My advice? If you feel a tickle, cut it short. It’s not worth hacking up a lung for a Tuesday run.

**Chilly Temps & Moderate AQI: Dress Smart, Breathe Easy**
With temperatures just barely above freezing and a moderate AQI from ozone, proper layering is non-negotiable. Think moisture-wicking base layers, a warmth-providing mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. For your lungs, consider reducing intensity or duration, especially if you're more susceptible to respiratory irritation. If you feel any discomfort, listen to your body and head indoors.

On the bright side, pollen is "Low" today, so at least your eyes and nose aren't trying to escape your face while you're out there. Take the small victories, people.

Upcoming weather reports are pointing to a potential shift this weekend, with snow making a comeback Saturday and Sunday, possibly dumping 2 inches or more along I-75 and the Ohio Turnpike by early Monday. There's even talk of a "blizzard" for Monday, March 2nd. So enjoy these *relatively* calm conditions while you can, because we might be back to full-blown winter running by the start of next week.

Speaking of Metroparks, don’t expect to splash around the **Mini Maumee Discovery Play** area. That’s been closed indefinitely since last summer due to a mechanical issue. No impact on your trail run, but good to know if you were planning a post-workout cool-down... or if you have kids.

Here's the current breakdown for the stuff you can't see but definitely feel:

| Pollutant Category | Level     |
| :----------------- | :-------- |
| Pollen             | Low       |
| AQI                | 77 (Moderate) |
| Dominant Pollutant | Ozone     |

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Zone Awareness**
If you're using routes that involve **Secor Road**, remember that traffic is restricted to a single lane in each direction due to ongoing construction. Be extra cautious of traffic, uneven surfaces, and potential detours. Always assume drivers don't see you.
