If you're looking for a comfortable outdoor workout in Akron today, you're out of luck. It's cold, it's windy, and construction is everywhere.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Brutally Cold Wind Chill:** The temperature is a crisp -3.5°C, but that 25.2 mph wind makes it *feel* like a nasty -8°C. Your lungs will hate you, and your joints won't be far behind.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** With an AQI of 70 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, anyone with respiratory sensitivities might feel it. It’s not a full-blown red alert, but it’s certainly not doing your lungs any favors in this cold.
*   **Construction Chaos:** Akron is basically one giant construction zone right now, and that extends to our trails and roads. Watch your step, watch for equipment, and generally be annoyed.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. We're runners. We like to pretend we're tough. But there's a difference between tough and stupid. Today leans towards the latter if you're not prepared. That bitter cold isn't just uncomfortable; it's a legitimate hazard, especially with the wind whipping through. Don't underestimate the risk of frostbite on exposed skin, and definitely consider how much harder your heart and lungs will be working just to keep you warm, let alone maintain pace.

Speaking of hazards, if you're planning a run through Cascade Valley Metro Park, be aware. Construction is actively happening on the Missing Link and Prather trails in the Valley View Area, and it's expected to continue through tomorrow, February 27th. They say "trail traffic will be maintained," but that means you need to be constantly vigilant for equipment and vehicles. Also, a significant chunk of the Chuckery Area remains closed for Gorge Dam removal and Northside Interceptor Tunnel work, which isn't finishing up until at least 2028. No shortcuts through there.

And don't even get me started on the roads. The city just passed a massive 2026 capital budget that includes millions for road resurfacing and bridge repairs across Akron, so expect detours and uneven surfaces everywhere from Home Avenue to North Main Street. The SR 261/All American Bridge northbound is closed for repairs through early March. Even the Freedom Trail has sections closed due to SR 8 bridge construction, with one part out until April 2026 and another until May 2026. Basically, assume your usual route is messed up.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| General     | Low     |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Danger: Extreme Cold & Wind Chill!**
Dress in layers, cover all exposed skin (face, ears, hands), and reconsider long outdoor activities. Hypothermia and frostbite are real risks with these wind chill values.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Everywhere!**
Exercise extreme caution on trails and roadways. Expect uneven surfaces, detours, and heavy equipment, especially in areas like Cascade Valley Metro Park and sections of the Freedom Trail. Plan alternative routes.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration is Key (Even When It's Cold)!**
You still sweat in cold weather, and the dry air can dehydrate you faster. Drinking fountains are likely turned off for the season in most Metro Parks, so bring your own water.
