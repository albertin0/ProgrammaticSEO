Alright, Akron, look, today's not a *bad* day to get out there, but you gotta be smart about it.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Pollen count is finally behaving itself, so your sinuses might actually thank you.
*   Temps are mild for late February, which is a rare treat. Enjoy it while it lasts, because winter isn't done with us yet.
*   Air quality is only "moderate" thanks to that persistent ozone, so maybe don't go trying to set any lung-busting PRs right by the highway.
</BulletList>

### Mind the Ozone, Marathoner

With an AQI of 70 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, your lungs are getting a moderate workout just by breathing. If you're sensitive, or if you were planning an absolutely brutal interval session, maybe dial it back or stick to an indoor gym. This isn't the day to push the edge on your respiratory system.

## Local Hazards & Headaches

You know the drill, Akron. We're always under construction.

**Trail Closures & Detours:** This city's trail network is a minefield of orange barrels right now. The Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail has a section closed under SR 82, and that's expected to continue through late December. Don't assume your usual route is open. Likewise, if you're a regular on the Freedom Trail, you're looking at multiple closures and detours through May and July 2026 due to ongoing construction, including the section between Brittain Road and Southwest Avenue in Tallmadge, and the new phase from Mill Street south to Buchtel Avenue. Plan ahead, check the Summit Metro Parks alerts, or be prepared to improvise.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Downtown Fireworks Tonight: Road Closures & No Parking!

If you were thinking of a Saturday evening stroll or run downtown, be aware that Bowery Street between Center Street and Quaker Street will be closed starting around 7:30 p.m. today, February 28, for the Lunar New Year Celebration Fireworks. No street parking in that area after 12 p.m.. Don't get towed or stuck trying to navigate downtown tonight. Find another spot for your evening activity.
</AlertBox>

**Chilly Outlook:** While it's relatively mild *right now*, don't get complacent. The forecast for tonight brings a chance of rain turning to snow, and temperatures dropping to 25°F by Saturday night, then a brisk 17°F on Sunday night. "Cold" becomes "Very Cold" pretty fast around here. Dress in layers, and remember those drinking fountains in Summit Metro Parks are still off for the season, so bring your own hydration.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Hydrate, Even When It's Cold

Just because you're not sweating buckets doesn't mean you don't need water. With park drinking fountains still shut down for winter, make sure to carry enough fluids, especially if you're out for a longer effort. Dehydration can sneak up on you in cooler weather.
</AlertBox>

Overall, a decent day if you manage expectations and avoid construction zones. Stay safe out there, Akron.
