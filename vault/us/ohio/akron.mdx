Alright, Akron, step outside if you dare, but keep your eyes peeled for detours and maybe consider that treadmill for once.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky is nice, but it's a brisk 3.1°C (37.6°F) out there. Don't be a hero; layer up or your joints will hate you later.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 73 AQI, with ozone as the main culprit. It's not terrible, but if your lungs are easily irritated, maybe stick to indoor activities today.
*   Major trail closures are still in effect, particularly around the Gorge Dam project and sections of the Towpath Trail. Good luck trying to get a continuous run in without rerouting!

The weather in Akron today, Thursday, February 26, 2026, is a mixed bag. We've got clear skies (mostly cloudy by day, clearing up tonight) and low pollen, which is a win for anyone with seasonal sniffles. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's prime running weather without a jacket; it's still hovering around freezing. You might even catch a few flurries, with a 10% chance of snow today.

Now, let's talk about the air. Our AQI is clocking in at 73, which is "Moderate" and driven by ozone. While generally acceptable for most folks, sensitive groups might experience some mild discomfort. AccuWeather even called today's AQI "Poor" for sensitive groups, so be mindful if you're prone to respiratory issues. Keep your workout intensity in check and listen to your body.

But the real kicker for us runners and cyclists? The never-ending symphony of Akron construction. If you were planning a nice long ride or run on the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail, be warned: sections are still impacted. While a specific alert for a Towpath Trail construction near the overlook structure between Memorial Parkway and Big Bend Trailheads ended yesterday, an older closure for the Towpath between Memorial Parkway Trailhead and the Mustill Store Trailhead due to Akron Waterways Renewed! work is still listed. Always check ahead.

<AlertBox type="danger">
The Chuckery Area of Gorge Metro Park remains closed for the Gorge Dam removal project, and honestly, it's not opening anytime soon – think 2028. If your route usually takes you through there, find an alternative. Glens Trail and the Highbridge Trail Area within Gorge Metro Park are also currently closed.
</AlertBox>

And let's not forget the Freedom Trail. Several sections are still under wraps due to the State Route 8 bridge construction, with closures expected to last through April and May. So, if you're trying to connect from Adams Park to Union Street, you're out of luck for a while.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Expect ongoing traffic disruptions on major roadways due to various resurfacing and bridge repair projects, including the SR 261/All American Bridge northbound closure through early March. While not directly a "workout hazard," it affects getting to your favorite running spots.
</AlertBox>

No major events are blocking our usual routes today, which is a small mercy. So, if you're heading out, dress warm, be aware of the air quality, and for Pete's sake, check for construction detours before you hit the pavement. Otherwise, you'll spend more time re-routing than actually working out.
