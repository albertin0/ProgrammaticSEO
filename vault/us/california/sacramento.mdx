Alright, Sacramento, if you're thinking of hitting the pavement or trails today, February 26th, 2026, you *can*, but don't be a hero.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Lungs are on Moderate Alert:** That AQI is sitting at 76 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not "stay inside and bubble-wrap yourself" bad, but it's certainly not fresh mountain air. If you've got asthma or any respiratory sensitivities, consider toning it down or finding an indoor alternative.
*   **Construction is Your Constant Companion:** Seriously, does this city ever stop digging? Roadway improvements are ongoing on major arteries like Arden Way and Watt Avenue, which means detours, uneven surfaces, and increased traffic noise if your route takes you near these areas. Don't expect a smooth sail everywhere.
*   **Weather's a Winner (Mostly):** At 15.2°C and clear skies, the temperature is pretty much perfect for a run or walk. Low pollen counts are a win for allergy sufferers. The NWS forecast mentioned "mostly cloudy" for today, but right now, we're looking good.
</BulletList>

## Local Lowdown

If you're aiming for a leisurely stroll through **Capitol Park**, be aware that the ongoing Capitol Annex overhaul means portions of the park are still blocked off. It’s a massive project, roughly 50 percent complete, and it’s going to be a fixture for a while. So, adjust your route accordingly or be prepared to zig-zag.

The American River Parkway, our beloved Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail, seems to be clear of *new* major closures for today within the Sacramento County stretch. However, keep your eyes peeled for localized issues or maintenance that pops up unannounced. The upcoming intermittent closures on the Folsom section of the Parkway (between Mountain Oak Court and Rainbow Bridge) don't kick in until March 17th, so you're good there for now.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Ozone on Your Run
An AQI of 76 with ozone as the primary pollutant means sensitive groups should be cautious. If you feel any burning in your chest or throat, cut your workout short. Ozone tends to peak in the afternoon, so an early morning workout might be a slightly better bet.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Watch Your Step (and Your Back) Near Construction
While no major trail *closures* within the immediate city are reported today directly impacting your run on the Parkway, the constant road work on places like Arden Way and Watt Ave can affect your approach to trails or your general neighborhood routes. Expect uneven pavement, sudden diversions, and more traffic than usual. Make sure drivers can see you.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Stay Hydrated and Present
Even with comfortable temperatures, keep that water bottle handy. And frankly, with all the ongoing construction around town, maintain situational awareness. Don't be that runner glued to their phone who trips over a newly laid curb or walks into a construction barrier. Look up, people.
</AlertBox>

It's a decent day to get out, but it's not without its typical Sacramento quirks. Moderate air quality and the usual city construction are the main things to watch.
