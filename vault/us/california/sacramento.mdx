Alright, Sacramento, if you're looking for a perfect excuse to skip that run today, I'm afraid you're mostly out of luck.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The weather is absolutely prime for a run or ride, so no complaints there.
*   Pollen count is low, so your sinuses get a reprieve.
*   Air quality is moderate due to ozone, which might be a concern if you're extra sensitive, but it's not a full-blown "stay inside" day.
</BulletList>

## The Rundown: Hit the Pavement, But Keep Your Eyes Peeled

Look, it's pretty good out there. We've got clear skies and a comfortable 19.5°C (that's pushing 67 degrees Fahrenheit for you metric-phobes). That's practically ideal for racking up some miles on the American River Parkway without feeling like you're baking or freezing. So, if your legs are feeling good, get out there.

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply If You're Delicate

Our AQI is sitting at 81, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. This isn't terrible, but it's not pristine mountain air either. If you have asthma or are particularly sensitive to air quality, you might notice it. Maybe dial back that sprint workout or stick to less intense efforts. For most of us, it's just a mild inconvenience.

## Construction & Road Closures: The Usual Sacramento Shuffle

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Alert: Keep Your Head Up on City Streets**
Ongoing construction is always a thing here. For example, there's a big apartment complex going up on Alhambra Boulevard, requiring demolition of existing buildings. If you're running or cycling through that area, expect potential localized noise, dust, and maybe some temporary pedestrian reroutes between C Street and 30th Street. Also, be mindful of various long-term county road projects like lane closures on Arden Way and Watt Avenue that can impact your planned route. Don't be that person who runs into a "Road Closed" sign with no plan B.

<AlertBox type="info">
**River Levels: Be Cautious Near Waterways**
While Sacramento isn't under a direct severe flood warning, the National Weather Service *did* issue a Flood Warning for sections of the Sacramento River north of us until tomorrow morning. This means river levels might be higher than usual. If you're planning a run along any part of the American River Parkway, just be aware that some low-lying areas could be damp or muddy, even if no official closures are in place for the immediate city parkway. Sorento Road, between Elverta and Rio Linda Roads, is still closed due to flooding. Don't mess with floodwater. Just don't.

### Pollen Breakdown: Enjoy the Clear Nose!

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Overall, it's a pretty decent day to get outside. Just be smart about where you're going, watch out for construction, and don't go trying to swim the American River. Your lungs will thank you for the low pollen, even if the ozone is giving them a slight workout.
