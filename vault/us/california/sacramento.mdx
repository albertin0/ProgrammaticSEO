Today? Yeah, you can probably drag yourself outside without actively trying to kill your lungs or wreck your knees.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is hovering in that "moderate" zone, so while it's not pristine, it's not actively trying to kill you today.</li>
  <li>Pollen is low, which means your sinuses aren't going to declare war on your face mid-run.</li>
  <li>Weather's clear and cool, a rare treat this time of year without a crazy wind advisory to knock you off your feet.</li>

## The Rundown: Breathe Easy-ish

Look, it's Sacramento. We usually have *something* trying to mess with our outdoor plans. Wildfire smoke in August, tule fog so thick you can't see the American River Parkway in December, or some random street closure for a marathon you forgot about. Today, though? Pretty chill.

The AQI is sitting at 88, thanks to some fine particulate matter floating around. That means it’s moderate. For most of us, that’s not a showstopper, especially if you’re just doing your usual loop around McKinley Park. If you've got compromised lungs, you might feel it a bit, so maybe keep your speed work indoors. But for your average jogger or power walker, it's fine. It's not the "air you can chew" days we get.

### Construction Chaos (Still)

Don't get too comfortable, though. While there aren't any *new* major hazards popping up in the last 24 hours, construction is always a thing here. That light rail expansion is still a beast, and you'll find unexpected detours near downtown and along Folsom Boulevard. It’s not a full-blown hazard, more of a persistent annoyance.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  Watch out for unexpected sidewalk closures, especially around the R Street Corridor and near Sac State. Don't assume your usual route is clear, because construction crews don't care about your Strava segments.
</AlertBox>

### Weather's Alright, Folks

Temperature's a cool 13.5°C (about 56°F) and it's clear. No rain to dodge, no gale-force winds to fight on the Guy West Bridge. Perfect for a long run along the Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail without feeling like you're running through a car wash or battling a wind tunnel. Just remember, "clear" doesn't mean "no glare," so sunglasses are still a good idea, especially heading east in the morning or west in the afternoon.

<AlertBox type="info">
  Hydrate, even if it's cool. Just because you're not sweating buckets doesn't mean you're not losing fluids. Don't be that person cramping up three miles from your car because you thought "cool air equals no water."
</AlertBox>

So, go on. Get out there. It's not a perfect 10, but for Sacramento in late February, it’s about as good as it gets without a lottery win. Just be aware of your surroundings, dodge a few cones, and try not to inhale too deeply near any idling buses.
