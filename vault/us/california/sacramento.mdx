It's Friday, and the sky's *clear* for now, which is a nice change of pace after the last few weeks, but don't get too complacent.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
- The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 77 today, with inhalable particulate matter floating around. It's not a lung-buster, but it's not exactly mountain air either.
- Pollen levels are blessedly low. Your sinuses can breathe easy, even if your lungs have to contend with other stuff.
- If your morning routine involves West Sacramento, prepare for some overnight shenanigans. Construction for the Sycamore Trail Pedestrian Overcrossing on US-50 means closures.

## Your Friday Run-Down: Clear Skies, But Keep An Eye Out

Alright, Sacramento, it’s February 28th, and we've got ourselves a "Clear" day with a comfortable 15.5°C. Sounds perfect, right? Well, almost. While the immediate weather is cooperating, we're not entirely out of the woods from what Mother Nature's thrown at us recently.

The biggest thing to watch out for today, especially if you're an early bird or a late-night pavement pounder, is the ongoing bridge construction. Specifically, we're talking about the Sycamore Trail Pedestrian Overcrossing work on US-50 in West Sacramento. They're doing overnight closures for falsework removal, which means Westbound 50 between I-5 and Harbor Blvd. will be shut down from 11 PM tonight until 3 AM Saturday. Eastbound 50 between I-80 and Jefferson Blvd will also see closures from 12 AM to 4 AM Saturday. This isn't just a minor lane shift; they're rerouting traffic onto I-80, I-5, and surface streets. If your run takes you anywhere near there, plan an alternate route or just stay home, seriously. Nobody wants to deal with that kind of traffic detour pre-dawn.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Overnight US-50 Closures in West Sacramento!** Avoid the Sycamore Trail Pedestrian Overcrossing construction area from 11 PM tonight (Feb 28) to 3 AM Saturday (Feb 29) for Westbound US-50, and 12 AM to 4 AM Saturday for Eastbound US-50. Find alternate routes!

Now, let's talk air. Our AQI is at a moderate 77. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). While not in the "unhealthy" zone, it's enough to notice if you're really pushing it. If you've got sensitive lungs, maybe dial back the intensity a notch, or stick to a shorter loop. It's a far cry from the "state of emergency" air alerts that hit parts of California a month ago due to PM2.5, but still, be aware.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality Alert:** AQI is 77 with inhalable particulate matter. Sensitive groups might want to reduce prolonged exertion outdoors. Keep an eye on how you feel.

Pollen, on the other hand, is playing nice today. It's at a "Low" level, so your allergies should give you a break. Go ahead and sniff those early spring blossoms without immediate regret.

Despite today's clear skies and comfortable temperature, remember the region has seen some significant rain and wind earlier this month. While the main storms have passed, some of those unpaved sections of the American River Parkway or other less-trafficked trails might still be a muddy mess or have lingering debris. Don't assume everything's bone dry just because the sun's out now. A clear sky doesn't magically absorb all that standing water from last week.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Trail Condition Tip:** Recent heavy rains mean unpaved trails, especially along the American River Parkway, might still be muddy or have slippery sections. Choose your footwear wisely, or stick to paved routes if you hate squelching.
</AlertBox>

So, get out there, enjoy the relatively clear air and comfortable temps, but stay sharp about that overnight construction and don't blindly trust every dirt path. Your knees, and your commute, will thank you.
