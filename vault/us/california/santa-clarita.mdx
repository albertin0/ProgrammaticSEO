Alright, Santa Clarita, let's talk about hitting those trails today. Honestly, it's a bit of a mixed bag, so don't just blindly lace up your shoes.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>The good news: the sun's out, and it's a pleasant 24.2°C (about 76°F), so you won't be melting or freezing out there.</li>
  <li>The not-so-good news: Your lungs might not love you. We're sitting at an AQI of 78, with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. That's not terrible, but it's certainly not pristine mountain air.</li>
  <li>If you were planning on venturing into the higher elevations, listen up: a temporary closure is *still* in effect for National Forest System trails within the Mount Baldy area of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, and that closure runs through today, February 26, 2026. Don't try to be a hero and ignore it; it's for your safety.</li>
  <li>Also, if your route usually takes you near Bouquet Canyon Road, be aware that a significant closure is in effect from Plum Canyon Road to David Way. This is for some pretty big construction—bridge removal, reconstruction, and expanding the flood control channel—and it's expected to last a good 11 months. So, that morning bike ride or run could be significantly rerouted.</li>
</BulletList>

## Your Daily Dose of Reality:

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Air Quality Advisory:** An AQI of 78 with inhalable particulate matter isn't going to kill you, but if you're sensitive, have asthma, or plan on a high-intensity, long-duration workout, consider scaling back or moving it indoors. You'll feel the difference.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Trail Closure: Angeles National Forest - Mount Baldy Area:** I'm not kidding about Mount Baldy. The trails in that area of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument are closed *today*. Do not attempt to bypass closures. Forest Service orders are there for a reason, usually related to unsafe conditions or recovery. Find an alternate route or risk a fine and potentially putting yourself and rescuers in danger.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Bouquet Canyon Road Detour:** For those who use Bouquet Canyon Road, especially for cycling or longer runs, plan your routes well in advance. This isn't a short-term fix; it's an 11-month project. Check the City of Santa Clarita's website for detour maps if you haven't already. Nobody likes unexpected road construction mid-run.
</AlertBox>

Look, I love getting out there as much as the next person, but sometimes you gotta be smart about it. Check the closures, pay attention to that AQI, and for Pete's sake, if a trail is closed, respect it. There's plenty of other pavement and open space to conquer in Santa Clarita if you look for it.
