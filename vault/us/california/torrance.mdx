Today's a decent day to get outside in Torrance, but don't go thinking it's pristine. It's Southern California, so "perfect" is a rare beast.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Air quality is sitting in that "moderate" zone, mainly due to ozone. Your lungs will probably notice if you push it hard.
*   Weather is pretty sweet – clear skies and mild temperatures make for a pleasant run or walk, a nice break from the recent atmospheric river drama.
*   Watch your step near Lomita Boulevard and Madison Street; traffic signal work means intermittent lane closures and general chaos.

## Environmental Breakdown

While we dodged the worst of the atmospheric river systems that slammed into Southern California earlier this month, February 26th brings us a bit of a mixed bag. The immediate threat of widespread flooding and debris flows seems to have passed for our neck of the woods, thankfully. That said, if you're thinking of venturing east, some higher elevation trails in the Angeles National Forest, particularly around the Mount Baldy area, are still under temporary closure due to hazardous winter conditions like snow, ice, and high winds, with these closures extended through today. Stick to the coast or lower elevations unless you like your trails with a side of frostbite.

### Air Quality Report

The air quality in Torrance today is clocking in at a "moderate" 59 AQI, with ozone being the main culprit. Now, for your average, healthy runner, this might just mean a slightly less peppy stride, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally sensitive lungs, you might want to consider easing up on the intensity. This isn't "stay indoors and seal the windows" bad like those wildfire smoke days we've seen (looking at you, January 2025), but it's also not "breathe deep and feel invigorated." Just be smart about your exertion, especially during the afternoon when ozone levels tend to peak.

## Local Hazards & Tips

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Road Work Ahead!

Heads up, runners and cyclists: If your route takes you anywhere near the intersection of **Lomita Boulevard and Madison Street**, you're going to hit some intermittent lane closures today. The City is doing traffic signal installation work, and it's scheduled from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. This isn't just an inconvenience; it can be a real safety issue with distracted drivers, unexpected detours, and reduced space. Find an alternate route or just plan to take it extra slow and be hyper-aware in that specific area. Seriously, don't assume drivers see you.
</AlertBox>

On the bright side, we're looking at clear skies and a comfortable 14.8°C (around 59°F) this morning, warming up a bit through the day. This is prime weather for hitting the paved path along Torrance Beach or enjoying a walk through one of our many parks without battling the elements. No crazy heat, no freezing temps. Just good, mild South Bay air (with a touch of ozone, of course). The chances of rain are minimal, so you shouldn't have to worry about slick surfaces or sudden downpours today.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Moderate AQI: What it means for you.

An AQI of 59, primarily from ozone, is okay for most people, but prolonged exposure or intense exertion can lead to minor respiratory symptoms. If you're sensitive, consider swapping that high-intensity interval training for a steady-state run, or moving your workout indoors if you start feeling anything. Listen to your body – it usually knows better than the official reports.
</AlertBox>

So, lace up, maybe grab a mask if your lungs are finicky, and enjoy the relatively calm conditions. Just steer clear of that construction on Lomita. Your workout isn't worth a fender bender, or worse.
