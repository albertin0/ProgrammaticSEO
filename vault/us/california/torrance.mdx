Alright, Torrance, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the dirt today. It's a decent day out there, but you gotta be smart about it.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are mild and the sun is out, making for a generally pleasant run or ride.
*   Pollen is practically nonexistent, so your sniffles should stay home.
*   AQI is still in that "moderate" zone, meaning if your lungs are finicky, you need to pay attention.
*   Road construction is a real thing, especially if you're out towards the coast.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe

Let's be real, the air isn't exactly mountain crisp today. Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 65, which lands us squarely in "Moderate" territory. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, specifically PM10 and PM2.5, which are those tiny bits floating around that love to irritate your lungs and throat.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Trees       | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Weeds       | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers: the pollen count is low across the board today. You can generally breathe easy on that front without your nose staging a rebellion.

## Weather Report: Clear Skies, Mild Vibes

The weather's pretty sweet, honestly. We're looking at a clear day with temperatures hovering around 20.2°C (about 68-70°F), which is prime running weather for most of us. Humidity is comfortable, and there's a gentle breeze from the west around 10-11 mph, which is nice for cooling off but won't be knocking you over.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### AQI: Watch Out, Sensitive Lungs!
Even though the AQI is "Moderate," AccuWeather says it's "Poor" for sensitive groups, and Weather Underground explicitly advises those with respiratory issues to "reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion." Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can irritate your respiratory system and aggravate existing heart and lung conditions. If you're sensitive, maybe dial back that high-intensity interval training or consider an indoor option.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Road Work on Palos Verdes Drive South
Heads up if your route takes you anywhere near Palos Verdes Drive South. There's ongoing roadwork through today (February 26th), which means potential traffic delays, lane closures, and uneven surfaces. This isn't just a nuisance for drivers; it's a hazard for runners and cyclists. Keep your head on a swivel, wear bright colors, and be ready for detours. And seriously, don't assume drivers see you.

## Local Trail Talk

If you're planning to hit a spot like the **Entradero Trail** or any other local path, you're generally in good shape weather-wise. No reports of flooding or closures directly on our local trails, but construction *near* major roadways (like Palos Verdes Drive South) could impact how you get there or require some unexpected street running. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially if you're sharing the road with cars.

### Stay Hydrated, Even When It's Mild
Just because it's not scorching doesn't mean you skip the water bottle. Staying hydrated is always key for performance and preventing those mid-run cramps. Your body still sweats and loses fluids, even on a mild day like this.
