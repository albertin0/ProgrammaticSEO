Alright, LA, don't let those clear skies trick you; today is a classic case of "looks can be deceiving" if you're planning a serious outdoor sweat session.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Pollen Apocalypse:** If your nose isn't already running like the 405 at rush hour, it will be. We're in "Very High" territory, folks.
*   **Air Quality: Not Great, Not Terrible:** The AQI is sitting at 53, which is technically "Moderate." Sounds benign, but that dominant fine particulate matter isn't exactly a lung-friendly cocktail for those of us who actually *use* our lungs.
*   **Trail Blockers:** Some of our favorite mountain escapes are still recovering or temporarily shut down, meaning your go-to long run might be a no-go.
*   **Heat is Coming:** While today's 19.3°C (67°F) feels great, consider it the calm before the unseasonably hot storm. Tomorrow is looking like a record-breaker.
</BulletList>

### The Pollen Problem

Let's be blunt: if you suffer from seasonal allergies, you probably already know. The tree pollen count is through the roof.

| Pollen Type | Level      |
| :---------- | :--------- |
| Tree        | Very High  |
| Grass       | Low        |
| Weed        | Low        |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Pollen Bomb Advisory:** "Very High" pollen isn't just a sniffle. For many, it means itchy eyes, sneezing fits, and constricted airways. Don't be a hero and try to PR your run up Griffith Park; you'll just end up wheezing at the top. Consider an indoor workout or limit your time outside, especially during peak pollen hours (mid-morning to early evening).
</AlertBox>

### Air You Breathing?

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 53, with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) as the main culprit. This falls into the "Moderate" category, which for some, is perfectly fine. For the rest of us – especially if you're pushing your cardiovascular system – it's something to think about.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Moderate AQI Means:** While the general population might not notice much, individuals unusually sensitive to air pollution should probably take it easy. If you have asthma, COPD, or other respiratory issues, listen to your body. Today isn't the day to test your limits on the Marvin Braude Bike Trail.
</AlertBox>

### Weather & What's Ahead

Today is clear and a comfortable 19.3°C (67°F). Enjoy it. But don't get too comfortable. Forecasters are calling for a significant warming trend, with possible *record-breaking heat* for Friday. We're talking upper 70s to low 80s in most areas, and some valleys could even hit the 90s. This is about 15-20 degrees above normal for this time of year.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heatwave on Deck:** While today is pleasant, Friday is looking brutal. Hydrate like crazy *today* if you plan to be active, and seriously reconsider any long, exposed workouts for tomorrow. Early morning is your only real window.

### Trail Status & Hazards

You might be itching to hit the higher elevations, but hold your horses. The Angeles National Forest has had temporary closures for trails in the **Mount Baldy** area (Mount San Antonio) which were in effect through *today*, February 26, 2026. This means while they might open up soon, they were still officially closed for public safety reasons due to hazardous winter conditions. Also, keep in mind that the Eaton Canyon Natural Area and its trails remain closed from previous fire activity, possibly through 2026. These closures aren't new, but they're a persistent nuisance for local runners and hikers.

Good news: no major wildfire smoke events are affecting us right now, unlike the 2025 fires that caused significant air quality issues. And while mid-February saw some gnarly flooding across LA, those conditions have cleared up. Also, the LA Marathon isn't until March 8th, so no road closures for that just yet.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**High-Elevation Trail Closures:** Even if the snow and ice have melted, trails like those around Mount Baldy can still be unstable. Respect the closures; they're there to keep you from becoming a search and rescue statistic. Stick to known open paths.

Run smart, LA. Your lungs and joints will thank you.
