Unless you enjoy running a gauntlet of allergens and fine particulate matter in spring-break-level heat, today's outdoor workout is a hard pass.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
*   Your lungs are taking a beating, whether you realize it or not. We're staring down a "Very High" pollen count, which is a nightmare for anyone with seasonal allergies. On top of that, our air quality is sitting at "Moderate" with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) as the dominant pollutant. That's a one-two punch for your respiratory system. Inhale at your own risk.
*   The weather might look "clear" and feel decent right now at 19.9°C (a balmy 68°F), but don't get complacent. This is just the lead-in to an unseasonably brutal heat wave. Tomorrow, Friday, is expected to bring record-tying or even record-breaking temperatures, with downtown L.A. hitting 88 degrees and Woodland Hills potentially reaching 91. This isn't just "warm for February," this is "sweat-through-your-eyeballs" hot.
*   Good luck finding an unencumbered trail. Much of the high-elevation terrain in the Angeles National Forest, specifically around **Mount Baldy**, was under temporary closure until *today*, February 26th, due to winter conditions like snow, ice, and high winds. Even if those signs come down, don't expect pristine, safe conditions immediately. And don't even think about **Eaton Canyon**; those trails are still largely shut down from last year's wildfire and likely will be through the end of 2026.

## Workout Hazards Today

**Pollen & Air Quality: The Silent Killers**
The combination of "Very High" pollen and "Moderate" air quality (AQI 53) means anyone with allergies, asthma, or other respiratory issues should seriously reconsider outdoor activity. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can penetrate deep into your lungs, and when mixed with a thick haze of pollen, it’s a recipe for discomfort, if not worse. Remember that little uptick in AQI we had around February 19th-20th, hitting 122 at one point? While not that high today, it shows how quickly things can change, and the underlying pollution is always there.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Heat Advisory: Seriously, Hydrate
Today's pleasant temperatures are a trick. This entire region is about to bake. Forecasters are calling for temperatures 15-20 degrees above normal, with Friday aiming to tie or break records. Running in this kind of unseasonable heat, especially if you're not acclimatized, is a direct path to heat exhaustion or stroke. If you *must* be outside, go early, go short, and carry more water than you think you need. Or, you know, just don't.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Trail Troubles: High-Country is Still Sketchy, Lower Trails Closed
While the official closure for some Mount Baldy area trails *might* be lifted today, common sense dictates that winter conditions at high elevations don't magically disappear overnight. Snow, ice, and unstable ground remain a real possibility. Stick to established, paved routes if you're desperate, but even then, heed the pollen and heat warnings. And for the love of all that is holy, stay out of Eaton Canyon. That area is still recovering from the 2025 fire.

### Looking Ahead: Marathon Road Closures Coming
Mark your calendars: the Los Angeles Marathon is on March 8th. This means significant road closures, particularly in West Hollywood along Sunset Boulevard, San Vicente Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, and Doheny Drive. If you usually run in those areas, plan alternate routes for that day and surrounding days as event setup and tear-down will impact access.
