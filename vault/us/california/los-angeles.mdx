Alright, Los Angeles, if you're thinking of hitting the pavement or trails today, I hope your allergy meds are locked and loaded, because your lungs are in for a ride.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Your sinuses are going to hate you.** "Very High" pollen levels are no joke, folks. That "clear" sky might look inviting, but it's just a clear view of all the misery floating around, ready to wreck your respiratory system.
*   **The air itself isn't exactly sparkling.** We're sitting at a "Moderate" AQI with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. Mix that with the pollen, and even at a pleasant 20.3°C (68.5°F), your lungs are working overtime.
*   **The mountains are a mess (still).** Planning a long run up in the **Angeles National Forest**? Think again. Multiple trails, especially around Mount Baldy, are still shut down through late March due to snow and flooding. And if you were eyeing Eaton Canyon, forget it; the fire recovery closures there are extended through late 2027.

</BulletList>

The weather itself, hovering around 68 degrees and clear, is actually pretty sweet for February in L.A. Too bad the air decided to pull a fast one.

## The Nitty-Gritty for Your Workout

### Air Quality & Allergies
Look, a Moderate AQI of 56 isn't the apocalypse, but when you combine it with "Very High" pollen, it’s a recipe for a snotty, wheezy workout. That particulate matter floating around isn't doing your airways any favors. If you're asthmatic or just generally susceptible to seasonal allergies, you’ll feel this one. Stick to indoor options if you can, or at least load up on the antihistamines and maybe wear a buff over your mouth if you insist on heading out.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Pollen Bomb Incoming:** With "Very High" pollen counts today, expect sneezing, itchy eyes, and potential respiratory irritation, especially if you have allergies or asthma. Keep your rescue inhaler handy if needed.
</AlertBox>

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant                  | Temperature (°C/°F) | Condition |
| :----------- | :---- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------- |
| Very High    | 56    | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) | 20.3°C / 68.5°F     | Clear     |

### Trail and Road Hazards

If you're one of those ambitious souls who ventures into the San Gabriel Mountains, heed the warnings. Many trails in the Angeles National Forest, particularly in the Mount Baldy area, remain closed until March 20th due to lingering snow and some flooding on SR 2. Seriously, don't be *that* person who ignores a closure and ends up needing a rescue. Our firefighters have enough on their plates investigating old fire cleanups.

Further east, the Eaton Fire Area Closure, affecting trails around Eaton Canyon, is a long-haul situation, lasting through December 2027 for public safety and natural recovery. Even roads leading to some trailheads, like Chaney Trail Road into Millard Canyon, are closed to vehicles for repairs until spring. You *can* walk in, but be prepared for extra mileage and potential obstacles.

Closer to the city, the LADOT is still working on improvements around Zoo Drive in Griffith Park, with striping and bollard installations wrapping up around March 1st. Expect limited lane closures there. Also, there's a community open house today for the MLK Jr. Boulevard Project if you're in that area, discussing new bike lanes. This might mean some localized foot traffic and minor disruptions.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Mountain Trails CLOSED:** Many trails in the Angeles National Forest, especially around Mount Baldy and Eaton Canyon, are officially closed for safety or fire recovery. Ignoring these closures can lead to fines, injury, or worse. Check the Angeles National Forest alerts before you go.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Heads Up, Urban Runners:** Keep an eye out for construction, particularly around Zoo Drive in Griffith Park, where lane closures are still in effect for safety improvements.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're going to get your sweat on today, pick your poison. Stick indoors, hit a track, or if you're outside, keep it mellow, stay hydrated, and for the love of all that is holy, take your allergy meds.
