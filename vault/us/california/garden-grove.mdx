<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Pristine:** Your lungs are getting a treat with an AQI of 42. Go ahead and breathe deep, you won't regret it.
*   **Pollen's Playing Nice:** Allergies won't be sidelining you today; pollen levels are thankfully low.

## The Daily Rundown for Garden Grove

Look, after those mid-February storms that drenched Southern California, it feels good to have some consistently clear weather. We're talking low pollen, an AQI that's well within the "Good" range at a breezy 42, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) as the dominant, but minimal, pollutant. The air is clean, the skies are clear, and frankly, it's a solid day to earn those endorphins.

However, don't let the pleasant morning fool you. We're seeing a trend toward warmer temperatures, with forecasters even hinting at "possible record-breaking heat to sweep across SoCal this week." While today's 78°F (25.5°C) high might feel great to some, it’s a nudge to remind you to hydrate like you mean it, especially if you're planning a longer run down the Medal of Honor Trail. That trail, by the way, has seen some good funding for enhancements like new benches, bike racks, and even fitness equipment, so enjoy those improvements. Just keep an eye out for any ongoing work, though no major disruptions have been reported recently.

No need to worry about dodging wildfire smoke today; there haven't been any significant local fires affecting our air quality in the last 24 hours. And those wind advisories? They were for places far north like Shasta Valley earlier this week, not here in Garden Grove. So, your hat should stay firmly on your head.

As for construction, the Woodbury Park Revitalization and Expansion Project is still on track for a spring 2026 completion, which is great news for future workouts, but as always, be mindful if you're in that area. No specific closures affecting popular running routes like the Medal of Honor Trail have been announced for today.

Overall, it's a prime day to get out there. Just be smart about the heat, grab your water bottle, and enjoy the clean air.

**Stay Aware of Your Surroundings:** While no major trail closures are reported, ongoing enhancements on paths like the Medal of Honor Trail mean you should always be vigilant for minor obstacles or workers, especially if you're flying through with headphones on.
