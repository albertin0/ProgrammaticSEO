Alright, Garden Grove, let's talk about getting outside today.

It's a pretty decent day to hit the pavement or dirt, *if* your lungs can handle a bit of Orange County's special blend of "moderate" air.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Ozone's a Factor:** That AQI is flirting with the "unhealthy for sensitive groups" line. It's not a full-on smog alert, but if you've got asthma or are just generally a little wheezy, you'll feel it.
*   **Trail Construction Continues:** The Mendez Freedom Trail on Hoover Street is still undergoing its transformation. Expect lane reductions and detours between Garden Grove Boulevard and Bolsa Avenue. It's a pain, but hopefully worth it when it's done in Fall 2025.
*   **Pothole Patrol:** Scattered reports of potholes and sidewalk issues were logged yesterday, so keep an eye on your footing, especially if you're bombing down residential streets.
</BulletList>

## The Full Breakdown

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply (If You're Sensitive)

Today's AQI is sitting at 71, with Ozone being the main culprit. That puts us squarely in the "Moderate" category, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's pristine. For anyone with respiratory issues, young kids, or the elderly, this is the kind of air that can absolutely trigger symptoms if you're out there pushing it. Ozone loves to irritate those airways, so if you find yourself coughing or feeling chest tightness, scale it back. It might look clear, and the temperature is a pleasant 15.8°C (around 60°F), but the air quality data tells a different story for some of us.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality Alert:** With an AQI of 71 and Ozone as the dominant pollutant, sensitive groups (asthmatics, children, older adults) should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion today. Listen to your body.

### Pollen Report: The One Good News Story

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are low. You can finally stop blaming your sniffles on tree fluff and point that finger directly at the ozone.

### Local Hazards: Watch Your Step & Your Route

Beyond the air, there aren't any major weather advisories for Garden Grove today. No extreme heat, no high winds to push you off your bike, and no flooding to turn your run into a swim.

However, if you're planning on using the **Mendez Freedom Trail**, be aware that construction is ongoing. This project is meant to bring a new multi-use pathway, which is great, but until it's finished (estimated Fall 2025), you'll encounter lane reductions on Hoover Street. This means less space and more potential for unexpected changes in your route. Stay vigilant, especially if you're cycling.

**Construction Zone Awareness:** The Mendez Freedom Trail construction on Hoover Street (between Garden Grove Boulevard and Bolsa Avenue) is still in progress. Plan for potential detours and reduced space if you're heading that way.

And as always, our beloved Garden Grove roads. Potholes and sidewalk issues are a constant game of whack-a-mole. We saw reports of various surface issues just yesterday, with some getting fixed and others still "in progress." Keep your eyes peeled, especially on residential streets like Edgewood Lane or Chapman Avenue, where recent reports were logged. A twisted ankle is a lot less fun than a good workout.
