Today's air quality is a bit of a bummer, but otherwise, it's a decent day for a workout if you know your limits.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 85, with Nitrogen Dioxide as the dominant pollutant. That's a solid "moderate" that can irritate your lungs, especially if you're out there pushing it.
*   Pollen is blessedly low across the board. No sneezing fits or itchy eyes derailing your long run today, so count that as a win.
*   The weather is clear and mild at a comfortable 16.9°C (62°F). Perfect for sweating it out without getting baked or frozen.

## The Air: A Mixed Bag for Your Lungs

Alright, San Jose, let's talk air. While some reports might call today's AQI "good", the data we're looking at puts us firmly in the moderate zone at 85, with Nitrogen Dioxide taking center stage. For most of us, this means you can probably get your steps in without growing a third lung, but don't expect it to feel like you're breathing mountain air. If you've got asthma, COPD, or just a general tendency to wheeze, you might want to consider dialing back the intensity or opting for an indoor session. AccuWeather specifically flags Nitrogen Dioxide at levels that could bother sensitive groups. It’s not a full-blown "stay inside" day, but it’s definitely not a "run like the wind" day either.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory:** With the Air Quality Index at 85 and Nitrogen Dioxide as the dominant pollutant, individuals with respiratory sensitivities (asthma, COPD) or heart conditions should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. Listen to your body and don't push it too hard.

## Trail Conditions: Mostly Clear, But Keep an Eye Out

The good news is we're not seeing any major, widespread trail closures due to recent high winds or flooding impacting San Jose today. The city usually does a decent job keeping us updated, and nothing big has hit the wires in the last 24 hours. The Super Bowl LX mess that had downtown streets and the San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail locked down? That was last week, so those areas are thankfully clear now.

However, if you're heading out to places like the **Guadalupe River Trail**, remember that stretches of it are notorious for seasonal flooding. While there's no active flood warning for today, conditions can change, and low-lying sections can get swampy even after rain has passed. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially near creek beds, and don't assume a trail is clear just because the sun's out.

**Guadalupe River Trail Note:** While there are no current flood alerts, the Guadalupe River Trail has historically experienced seasonal flooding. Always exercise caution on low-lying sections and be prepared to reroute if you encounter standing water or muddy conditions.

## Weather & Pollen: Your Body Will Thank You

Temperature-wise, it's a mild 16.9°C (62°F) under clear skies, which is pretty much ideal for getting outside. Not too hot, not too cold. Just right for working up a good sweat. And for all you snifflers, the pollen count is low, so your nose and eyes can take a break from their usual Bay Area battle. Enjoy the comfortable temps and lack of allergens – two fewer things to complain about.

In short, it's a day for cautious optimism. Embrace the low pollen and pleasant temps, but respect the air quality, especially if your lungs are easily annoyed.
