You know, San Jose, today's one of those days where you really gotta pick your poison for an outdoor sweat session.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That "moderate" AQI? Don't let it fool you. We're still breathing in a decent chunk of Nitrogen Dioxide, thanks to our lovely traffic and industrial hotspots. Your lungs might not love that.
*   Mother Nature's been doing a number on our trails. We've got actual *flooding* on some major paths and a bunch of closures up in Alum Rock. Unless you're training for an adventure race, maybe stick to pavement.
*   Temperatures are pretty solid, and the pollen count is finally behaving itself, which is a small victory for your sinuses and joints.
</BulletList>

Look, the weather might be "clear" and a pleasant 15.6°C (that's about 60°F for the Fahrenheit faithful), with low pollen, so that's a win for avoiding the sneezes and heat stroke. But let's get real about what's actually happening out there.

The air quality, sitting at an AQI of 85, might seem acceptable on paper. But with Nitrogen Dioxide being the dominant pollutant, especially near major roadways and urban areas like San Jose, your respiratory system is still getting a workout it didn't ask for. If you've got any kind of lung sensitivity, this isn't the day to be hammering out those intervals next to the 880. AccuWeather even flagged our NO2 levels as "Poor" for sensitive groups today, so listen to your body, not just the number.

Then there are the trails, and oh boy, it's a soggy mess in some spots. The Guadalupe River Trail at Highway 101? Minor flooding. Expect wet feet if you're on foot, or a splashy ride if you're on two wheels. Same goes for parts of the Los Gatos Creek Trail near the Leigh Ave storm drain. And don't even think about the Coyote Creek Trail under Highway 237; parts of that are reportedly under *deep water*. You've been warned. The City of San Jose also explicitly states you should "proceed with extreme caution during rainy weather and not travel through any standing water" on trails, because those under-crossings become surprise swimming pools.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Flooding Ahead: Creeks and Rivers are Swollen!**
Avoid flooded sections of the Guadalupe River Trail, Los Gatos Creek Trail, and especially the Coyote Creek Trail. "Minor flooding" can still mean hidden hazards, and "deep water" is just asking for trouble or a broken ankle.
</AlertBox>

And if you were eyeing Alum Rock Park for some elevation, think again. That place is a minefield of closures. The Penitencia Creek Trail is out at the Trestle Bridge, and the Mineral Springs Trail is closed due to erosion. Even more concerning, the South Rim Trail and Sycamore Switchbacks are *temporarily closed due to mountain lion sightings*. No PR is worth becoming mountain lion bait. Vehicle access to the park is also limited due to falling rocks, though you can still walk in. Seriously, respect those signs.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Alum Rock Park: Trail Closures & Mountain Lion Warnings!**
Multiple trails, including South Rim and Sycamore Switchbacks, are closed due to active mountain lion sightings. Do NOT ignore these warnings.

So, what's left? If you're determined to get outside, stick to paved areas away from major traffic corridors. Maybe find a park with open, well-maintained asphalt paths, or hit up your local track. Just remember, your lungs are working harder than usual today, and a lot of our prime running real estate is currently underwater or home to large, furry predators. Choose wisely.
