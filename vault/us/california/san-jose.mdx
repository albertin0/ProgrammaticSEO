Alright, San Jose, let's talk about hitting the trails today.

Honestly, it's a pretty decent day for a workout, but you'll want to choose your route wisely.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Moderate:** An AQI of 74 with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) as the dominant pollutant means sensitive groups should probably take it easy or stick indoors. For the rest of us, it's not terrible, but it's not sparkling clean either.
*   **Weather is Beautiful:** A clear sky and a comfortable 17°C (62°F) are prime conditions for getting outside without roasting or freezing.
*   **Pollen is Low:** Good news for your sinuses! Allergy sufferers can breathe a little easier out there today.
*   **Trail Closures are a P.I.T.A.:** Several popular spots, including sections of the Los Gatos Creek Trail and areas in Sanborn County Park, are still dealing with closures due to unsafe conditions or ongoing construction. Plan ahead or face an unexpected detour.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality Details

Our current AQI is sitting at 74, which lands us squarely in the "Moderate" category. While it's certainly better than breathing truly foul air, that fine particulate matter can still be an irritant, especially if you're pushing hard. If you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, maybe keep your run to a gentler pace or reconsider that long climb up Mount Hamilton.

### Trail Conditions & Closures

Good news for your lungs on the pollen front, but your feet and bike tires might have a different story.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads up on the Los Gatos Creek Trail:** A section is still partially closed due to unsafe conditions. There's a short detour, but don't just blindly follow your usual route or you'll be stopped dead in your tracks.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Avoid Sanborn County Park in some areas:** If your usual loop takes you through the Costanoan area, the parking lot, or the Ohlone picnic area, you're out of luck. These spots are locked down through the end of March and April 2026, respectively, for major trail construction and paving improvements.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**County Park Trail Restrictions:** Many trails in Calero County Park, Joseph D. Grant County Park, Coyote Lake-Harvey Bear Ranch County Park, and Mt. Madonna County Park are still closed to equestrians and bicyclists. These closures are often lingering from previous wet weather, so even with today's clear skies, expect potentially muddy or unstable sections.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Martial Cottle Park Advisory:** The Cooney Ranch Trail remains closed due to flooding. Stay out of closed areas, folks.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Upcoming Prescribed Burns:** Keep an eye out for news regarding prescribed burn piles starting in winter 2026 at Joseph D. Grant and Calero County Parks. While not active today, it's something to be aware of if you frequent those areas.
</AlertBox>

Today's a mixed bag. The weather is fantastic, and pollen isn't an issue. However, the moderate AQI means you might not feel 100% on a hard effort, and the numerous trail closures mean you absolutely need to check your preferred route before you head out the door. Don't be that person surprised by a "Trail Closed" sign halfway through your run.
