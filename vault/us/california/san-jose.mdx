Alright, San Jose, let's talk about hitting the trails today.

Today's a mixed bag, but mostly leans towards "get out there."

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The skies are clear, and at a comfortable 19.4°C, it's not going to bake you or freeze your digits off. Perfect running weather, if you ask me.
*   Pollen count is blessedly low. Your sinuses can breathe a sigh of relief, unlike some brutal spring days around here.
*   However, we're sitting at an AQI of 80, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. This nudges us into the "moderate" zone, so don't be a hero if your lungs are usually throwing a fit.

### Air Quality Reality Check

Look, AQI 80 isn't ideal, especially with ozone hanging around. For most of you, it's probably fine for a moderate pace or shorter runs. But if you're asthmatic, have other respiratory issues, or just generally feel like crap on hazy days, dial it back. That "moderate" warning isn't just for show – it means sensitive folks might feel some minor irritation. Don't push it if you start feeling anything beyond normal exertion.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert for Sensitive Lungs!** While the air quality is generally acceptable, an AQI of 80 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant means if you're in a sensitive group (asthma, heart issues, etc.), you might experience minor to moderate symptoms. Consider shorter workouts or lower intensity today.

### Trail Talk: Coyote Creek and Beyond

The Coyote Creek Trail is a fantastic stretch, but keep your eyes peeled. There's construction around parts of it, with various projects underway or scheduled to begin this month. We're talking about things like new Class I trail sections, which is great for the long term, but means disruptions in the short term. Always be aware of your surroundings, watch for equipment, and respect any temporary detours or closures. Nobody wants to end up in a construction pit trying to shave 30 seconds off their PR.

And speaking of closures, if you're thinking of venturing to some of the county parks, be aware of ongoing issues. Areas of Anderson Lake County Park are closed until *2032* due to the Anderson Dam Seismic Retrofit Project. Also, other Santa Clara County Parks like Almaden Quicksilver, Calero, Joseph D. Grant, and Coyote Lake-Harvey Bear Ranch have had trail closures to equestrians and bicyclists due to current (or recently passed) weather conditions, and some have prescribed burn piles starting this winter. Always double-check county park websites before you head out, because getting there and finding your favorite section roped off is a real buzzkill.

**Always Check Ahead for County Parks:** While the main San Jose trails are generally good to go, county parks often have specific, localized closures due to conditions or long-term projects. Give their websites a look before you drive all the way out there.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level (Today) |
| :---------- | :------------ |
| Trees       | Low           |
| Grass       | Low           |
| Weeds       | Low           |

### Final Thoughts

Overall, it's a decent day for a workout in San Jose. The weather's cooperating, and the pollen is behaving. Just be smart about that moderate AQI if you're sensitive, and don't assume your usual trail is entirely clear of construction or lingering county park closures. Happy running, folks.
