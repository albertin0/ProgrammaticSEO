It's a "take what you can get" kind of day out there, San Jose. Not great, not terrible, just... Bay Area in late winter.

<LungsJointsScore score={6.5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI is nudging up there with "moderate," mainly due to ozone. Your lungs might feel it if you push too hard, especially if you're sensitive.
*   **Mild Temperatures:** At 15.1°C (59°F) and clear, your joints won't be screaming from the cold or melting from the heat. Perfectly comfortable running weather on that front.
*   **Lingering Dampness:** While the heavy storms of earlier this week have passed, central California received significant precipitation. Expect some trails to still be damp or muddy, which means you need to watch your footing to keep those ankles happy. The Guadalupe River Trail, for instance, is notorious for seasonal flooding at low points, even when there isn't an active warning.

### Air Quality Report: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

That AQI of 79 isn't exactly "crisp mountain air." The dominant pollutant today is Ozone. For most of us, it's generally acceptable for outdoor activities, but anyone with respiratory issues might notice some minor irritation. It's also worth remembering that just yesterday, Wednesday, a semitruck fire on US-101 in San Francisco caused "heavy clouds of smoke blowing across the highway." While that's up the peninsula, regional air patterns can carry that crud around.

Here's the lowdown on what's floating around:

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :---- | :----------------- |
| Low          | 79    | Ozone              |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert: The Sun's Not Always Your Friend**
Ground-level ozone, often worse on sunny days after a period of moderate air pollution, can aggravate existing respiratory conditions like asthma. If you're sensitive, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to shorter routes.
</AlertBox>

### Trail Conditions: Watch Your Step

Temperatures are lovely and mild, sitting comfortably around 15.1°C (59°F). But don't let the clear skies fool you into thinking every trail is bone dry. We've had some significant rain in the past week across the state, and even if San Jose wasn't directly in the heaviest downpours, residual moisture means muddy patches are highly likely. This is especially true for trails that don't get much sun or have poor drainage.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Calero County Park Closures!**
Heads up if you're planning a long run down by Calero County Park. As of February 21, 2015 (which is almost certainly a typo in the source and intended for 2025 or 2026 given other dates in the article), trails were closed to equestrians and bicyclists due to "current weather conditions" and the Serpentine Loop due to "poor trail conditions." While that date reference is a bit old, it's prudent to check the Santa Clara County Parks website for **current** conditions before you head out, especially after recent rainfall. You don't want to get stuck in the mud or risk injury on unstable ground.
</AlertBox>

### My Two Cents

It's clear and mild, which is a win for February. Just be smart about your run. Check local park websites for specific trail closures before you drive all the way out there, especially if you're hitting spots like Calero or areas near the creeks. Given the moderate AQI, maybe don't push for a new personal best today, particularly if you're prone to lung irritation. Stick to well-maintained paths, hydrate, and enjoy the relatively calm weather while it lasts.
