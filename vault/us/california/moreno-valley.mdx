Alright, Moreno Valley, it's Saturday, and if you're planning an outdoor sweat session, you're looking at a mixed bag of conditions out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality isn't doing anyone favors, especially if your lungs are already finicky. PM10 is floating around, making the "moderate" AQI feel a bit more like "meh" for sensitive folks.
*   Weather-wise, it's clear and heading towards warm, which is lovely for most, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's completely benign.
*   For those of you who hit the Moreno Valley Mall for your laps, guess what? It's still partially shut down due to those "life-threatening fire code violations," and yes, that means no morning mall walks. Stick to outdoors or find another indoor spot.
</BulletList>

## Today's Rundown

The sun's out and trying to bake us, with temperatures hitting nearly 89°F later today. Good for working up a sweat, but also good for getting dehydrated if you're not smart about it. That light northwest breeze at 5 mph won't do much to cool you off either.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Keep an Eye (and Lung) on the Air Quality
Your AQI is sitting at 58, which technically falls into "Moderate" territory. However, don't let that fool you. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (PM10), and some sources are calling it "Poor" or "unhealthy for sensitive groups," citing an AQI of 64 for PM10 and NO2. If you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally feel like crap when the air's heavy, scale back your outdoor exertion, especially later in the day when those particles might get stirred up. Consider moving your workout indoors if you're in a sensitive group.
</AlertBox>

Pollen levels are currently low, so at least your nose won't be staging a full-on rebellion today.

### Moreno Valley Mall Still Closed for Walkers
For those of you who rely on the Moreno Valley Mall for a sheltered, predictable walking environment, remember: it's been temporarily partially closed since February 19th due to fire code violations, and that includes no morning mall walks. Find an alternative route or trail.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of alternatives, if you're looking to hit the Juan Bautista de Anza Multi-Use Trail, or any of the city's other fantastic trails, today's conditions are generally okay, provided you manage that air quality risk. Just remember your hydration strategy for the warmth.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate
With temps pushing towards 89°F, even though it's still February, you can definitely get overheated. Carry more water than you think you need, especially if you're tackling any of the longer stretches around Lake Perris State Park. Plan your routes to include water stops if possible.
</AlertBox>

Finally, a quick geological reminder: Moreno Valley is in an active seismic zone. We've had 42 small quakes (up to M1.8) in the last 24 hours. While these are tiny and usually unfelt, it's a good general practice to know what to do if the ground decides to do more than just shake a little.
