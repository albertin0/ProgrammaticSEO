Alright, Moreno Valley, if you're not planning a leisurely stroll, today's outdoor workout comes with a few too many asterisks for my taste.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **The Air's a Bit Gritty:** We're sitting at a moderate AQI, thanks to inhalable particulate matter. That lovely construction dust from half the city's projects isn't doing your lungs any favors.
*   **Heat's Creeping Up:** While it's clear out, that thermometer's pushing into the low 80s Fahrenheit, with "minor heat risk" for inland valleys. It's only going to get hotter tomorrow. Hydration isn't a suggestion, it's a mandate.
*   **Construction Chaos:** Forget clear pathways. There's so much going on around town, from the massive World Logistics Center to bridge repairs and drainage projects, you're practically guaranteed some detours or dusty patches.
</BulletList>

## The Full Breakdown

Here’s what’s happening with the air you breathe and the ground you pound:

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant         | Temperature (°C/°F) | Condition |
| :----------- | :---- | :------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------- |
| Low          | 53    | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) | 25.3 / 77.5         | Clear     |

### Pollen: A Rare Win for Your Sinuses

Good news for once, allergy sufferers: pollen levels are low today. Don't get used to it, but enjoy the brief reprieve if that's usually your Achilles' heel.

### Air Quality & Construction: A Dusty Combo

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality & Construction Dust!**
The AQI is currently 53, indicating moderate air quality due to inhalable particulate matter (PM10). If you have respiratory sensitivities, today might be better spent indoors, or at least sticking to less exposed routes. All that ongoing construction around town, especially the gargantuan World Logistics Center along Redlands Boulevard and Gilman Springs Road, is kicking up a lot of dust that contributes to these levels. Expect some gritty air and plan your route to avoid major construction zones if possible.
</AlertBox>

### Weather: Warm and Warming

It's a clear day, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's cool. We're hitting a pleasant 25.3°C (77.5°F) right now, but temperatures are pushing into the low to mid-80s Fahrenheit throughout the day. The National Weather Service even issued a "minor Heat Risk" for our inland valleys, and Friday is forecast to be even hotter, hitting nearly 90°F.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Don't Underestimate the Heat!**
Even with clear skies, these temperatures are no joke. Dehydration can creep up on you fast. Carry more water than you think you need, wear light clothing, and consider adjusting your workout time to early morning or late evening. If you're feeling light-headed or dizzy, cut your run short. No PR is worth a heat stroke, people.
</AlertBox>

### Local Hazards & Detours: More than Just Potholes

Moreno Valley is a city under construction, and your run routes are likely to feel it. There are several major infrastructure projects happening. The **Juan Bautista de Anza Multi-Use Trail Project**, which runs from the Moreno Valley Mall to Lake Perris State Park, is in a comprehensive planning and construction phase to fill in gaps. This means you could hit detours or active work areas near sections of the trail.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Plan Your Lake Perris Trail Run.**
If you're heading out to the Juan Bautista de Anza Multi-Use Trail towards Lake Perris, be aware that there are ongoing efforts to improve and extend it. While great for the future, this means you might encounter active construction. Check local city updates for specific closures or detours if you're planning a long run on that route. Stick to designated paths and watch out for machinery or uneven surfaces.
</AlertBox>

Elsewhere, don't forget the temporary closure of parts of the Moreno Valley Mall due to fire safety violations. While not a running trail, it's a huge disruption in the city that reminds us to stay aware of local hazards.

### Fire Risk: Keeping an Eye Out

The fire risk today is moderate due to dry vegetation, and it jumps to *extreme* tomorrow with hotter, drier conditions. While there are no active fires currently spewing smoke into our local air, it's a good reminder to be extra vigilant, especially if you're hitting any more wildland-urban interface trails. No smoking on trails, obviously, but just generally be aware.
