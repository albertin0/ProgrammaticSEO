Alright, Escondido, if you're looking for an excuse to ditch your workout, today isn't really it, but don't expect smooth sailing everywhere.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Construction Chaos:** The Escondido Creek Trail is still a construction zone, folks. Expect detours, closures, and general upheaval if that's your usual route.
*   **Ozone's Back (Sort Of):** Our air quality isn't "bad," but it's officially "Moderate" thanks to ozone. If your lungs are sensitive, dial it back.
*   **Pollen Peace:** At least your allergies get a break with low pollen counts. Enjoy it while it lasts.
</BulletList>

### Lungs & Air Quality Breakdown

The good news for your lungs is that the pollen count is nice and low. The bad news? Our air quality is in the "Moderate" zone because of ozone. While it's not a red-alert situation, anyone with respiratory issues, or if you're planning a particularly intense session, should pay attention. You might feel it more than usual.

| Pollutant          | Level  |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| General AQI        | 71     |
| Dominant Pollutant | Ozone  |

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Ozone, Especially Near Traffic
With an AQI of 71 and Ozone as the dominant pollutant, those with asthma or other respiratory sensitivities might find sustained, heavy exertion uncomfortable. Ozone levels tend to be higher during the day and can be exacerbated by vehicle emissions, so consider an early morning run or stick to less trafficked areas if you're concerned.

### Joints & Ground Conditions Breakdown

Temperatures are a pleasant 15.7°C (around 60°F) and the sky is clear, which is pretty solid for getting outside. No extreme heat, no bone-chilling cold. However, the ground game in parts of Escondido is still a mess.

### Construction Update: Escondido Creek Trail & Harding Street

Listen up, because this is where your plans might hit a wall. The Escondido Creek Trail continues to be under heavy construction, which started back in February 2025 and was *supposed* to be done by late 2025, but clearly, "pending unforeseen delays" was doing a lot of heavy lifting there.

We're talking "day-to-day temporary closures on the north and south side during irrigation and electrical work," and a "continued long-term closure at Date Street on both sides of the creek." That means if you're planning your usual loop, be ready to reroute or bail entirely. Flaggers *might* be on site, but don't count on them being everywhere you need them.

And it's not just the Creek Trail. The Southern First Aqueduct Facilities Improvement project means traffic diversions on Harding Street between East Washington Avenue and the Escondido Creek Channel. The sidewalk and a traffic lane on the south side are closed until summer 2025, but the overall project runs through summer 2026. So even getting *to* some areas near the trail might be a pain.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Escondido Creek Trail: Significant Disruptions
Don't assume your favorite sections of the Escondido Creek Trail are open. There are widespread temporary closures and a long-term closure at Date Street. Plan alternative routes or stick to residential streets if the trail is part of your usual workout. This isn't just a minor detour; it could seriously impact your run or ride.

### Alternate Route Tip: Dixon Lake Trails
If the Escondido Creek Trail is proving too frustrating, consider heading north to Dixon Lake. Their trail system offers varied terrain and some decent climbs without the current construction headaches. It's a solid alternative for getting those miles in without dodging cones and heavy machinery.

### The Bottom Line

It's a clear day, good temp, and low pollen. Go get your sweat on. Just be smart about your breathing if you're sensitive to air quality, and for the love of all that is holy, check for construction updates *before* you head out to the Escondido Creek Trail. Seriously, plan B is your best friend right now.
