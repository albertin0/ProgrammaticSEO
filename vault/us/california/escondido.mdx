Alright, Escondido, today's a classic case of 'get it done early' before the heat gets serious, but watch out for those familiar trail headaches.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>The morning's got a pleasant 19°C (66°F) and clear skies, which is prime running weather before our valley heats up later in the day, pushing towards a predicted 87°F (30.5°C).</li>
  <li>Pollen counts are low, so your sinuses get a break today.</li>
  <li>Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 62, with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) as the dominant pollutant. It's not great, but it's far from "stay inside" territory if you're otherwise healthy.</li>
</BulletList>

## The Nitty Gritty: Trail Hazards & What to Watch For

Let's be real, you can't swing a dead cat in Escondido without hitting a construction zone, and our beloved **Escondido Creek Trail** is no exception. If you're planning on hitting the pavement or dirt there today, be alert.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  There's ongoing construction along the Escondido Creek Trail. Expect day-to-day temporary closures on both the north and south sides for things like lighting installation and irrigation work. Seriously, pay attention to the signs – don't be that runner who gets surprised by a trench. There's also a continued long-term closure at Date Street on both sides. Construction typically runs Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

### Air Quality Deets

That AQI of 62 is "Moderate," meaning unusually sensitive people might experience respiratory symptoms. The dominant pollutant is particulate matter (&lt;10µm). While there's a moderate fire risk in the area due to dry vegetation, there are no active wildfires currently pumping smoke directly into our valley. It's more likely general urban grime, so don't hit the trails if you're feeling extra sensitive today.

### Temperature Talk

We're starting nice, but that forecasted high of 87°F (30.5°C) for later today means you need to front-load your long runs. Hydrate early, hydrate often, and don't assume that lovely morning chill will stick around. Your joints will thank you for getting out before they have to deal with the inevitable midday bake.

### Wind & Wetness

Winds today are expected to be light, generally 2-7 kts (2.3-8 mph), so no fighting a headwind for 10 miles. And good news on the wet front – no significant rainfall in the last 24 hours, and only a 10% chance of rain today. We've seen some serious flooding in San Diego County recently (January 2026, and even February 17, 2026, had some wet weather and flooding), but today isn't one of those days, so trails are likely dry.

### Shakes and Quakes

Escondido had one minor earthquake (magnitude 1.5 or greater) in the past 24 hours. This is pretty standard for California and nothing to lose sleep over unless you're literally running on a fault line. Keep your eyes open for cracks, I guess.
