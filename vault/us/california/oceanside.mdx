Alright Oceanside, if you absolutely *must* get your miles in, today's a mixed bag, but mostly leans towards "go for it, just watch your step and your lungs."

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  - The air's got a bit of an ozone hangover, so don't expect crisp, clean breaths, especially later in the day.
  - Parts of our beloved Coastal Rail Trail are still a construction zone, turning your smooth ride into a detour headache.
  - Downtown's going to be a cluster with the Sunset Market tonight, so plan your evening routes accordingly.

## The Rundown for February 26, 2026

The sun's out, the temperature's mild at 14.4°C (that's pushing 58°F for you Fahrenheit folks), and frankly, it's a pretty nice day to be outside. No rain, no howling winds, just clear skies. But before you lace up and blast out the door like a gazelle on espresso, let's talk about the less-than-perfect bits.

### Air Quality & Your Lungs

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a moderate 65, with ozone being the main culprit. Moderate means it's generally okay, but if you're sensitive or planning a hardcore effort, you might notice it. It's not the kind of air that'll make your lungs seize up, but it's also not champagne. Think of it as a slightly stale sparkling cider.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Ozone Alert:** With a moderate AQI of 65 due to ozone, consider dialing back intense cardio, especially during peak afternoon hours. Your lungs will thank you for not pushing them harder than necessary.
</AlertBox>

### Trail Troubles & Roadblocks

Remember that never-ending saga of the Coastal Rail Trail? Yeah, still going. There's ongoing construction aiming to fill those gaps between Oceanside Boulevard and Morse Street, which means new path segments and a shiny new bridge over Loma Alta Creek. Good for the future, annoying for today. If your route usually involves that stretch, you'll need to find an alternative.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Coastal Rail Trail Construction:** Portions of the Coastal Rail Trail are under active construction. Expect detours and closures, particularly between Oceanside Boulevard and Morse Street. Don't risk it; find another path. The San Luis Rey River Trail is generally a safe bet for uninterrupted miles.

Speaking of local annoyances, don't forget it's Thursday, which means the Sunset Market is taking over Pier View Way and North Tremont Street downtown from 5 PM to 9 PM. If your evening run usually weaves through that area, prepare for crowds, street closures, and the irresistible smell of international food. Unless you're planning a *very* slow shuffle punctuated by samosas, avoid it.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Evening Downtown Crowds:** The Sunset Market is happening tonight (5 PM - 9 PM) on Pier View Way and North Tremont Street. Avoid running in this area if you prefer open roads over navigating through food stalls and families.

### Recent Local Flare-ups

Just yesterday (February 25th), there were reports of a brush fire near Oceanside. While our current AQI isn't screaming "smoke," localized hot spots or residual ash can still be an issue. Use common sense: if you smell smoke, turn around. It's not worth risking your respiratory health. CAL FIRE also noted that wildfire activity is trending above normal for Southern California this year, so stay vigilant.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Level |
| :----------- |
| Low          |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are low today. One less thing to sneeze about mid-stride.

Overall, it's a decent day for a workout if you stick to familiar, clear routes and aren't planning a lung-busting personal best. Just be smart about where you're going and what you're breathing.
