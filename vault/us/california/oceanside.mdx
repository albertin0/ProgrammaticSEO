Alright, Oceanside, listen up. Today's a mixed bag, so don't just blindly hit the pavement.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   **Weather's a Dream:** You couldn't ask for better running weather in late February. Clear skies and a comfortable 19.3°C (that's nearly 67°F for you Celsius-challenged folks) mean you won't be sweating through your eyeballs or shivering your glutes off. Perfect for those longer efforts or just a breezy walk by the water.
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a "Moderate" 80, with Nitrogen dioxide being the main culprit. Look, it's not a complete shutdown, but if you've got asthma, lung issues, or you're one of those sensitive types, this is your warning. Reduce your prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. Don't push it like it's a pristine alpine morning.
*   **Downtown Chaos:** It's Thursday, which means the Oceanside Farmers Market (9 AM - 1 PM) and the Sunset Market (5 PM - 9 PM) are both in full swing on Pier View Way. Forget hitting your stride there; it'll be a human obstacle course of organic produce and artisan crafts. Plan your route to avoid that mess unless you're into dodging strollers and sniffing candles mid-run.
</BulletList>

### Downtown Digging & Dining Disaster

Look, there's always something under construction in this town, and today's no different. The "Downtown Water and Sewer Replacement – Phase II Project" is kicking off in late February/early March. They're starting in the alley south of Meyer Street and north of Pacific Street. While major road closures are slated for night work, expect some daytime impacts between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.. If your usual loop takes you through those specific downtown alleys, be prepared for detours or just pick a different spot.

Also, remember that early morning fire yesterday at Alfredo's Mexican Restaurant on North Coast Highway? Firefighters had to deal with a broken gas line and temporary street closures. While things should be mostly cleared by now, there might still be some cleanup or lingering activity. If your run involves North Coast Highway, keep an eye out for anything unusual.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level   |

Good news for your allergies, Oceanside. The pollen count is low today. Your nose and eyes can breathe a sigh of relief, even if your lungs are dealing with a bit of NO₂.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Caution for Sensitive Groups:** An AQI of 80 means the air quality is "generally acceptable for most individuals." However, sensitive groups (children, older adults, people with lung or heart disease, and outdoor workers) "may experience minor to moderate symptoms from long-term exposure." Consider scaling back intense or prolonged outdoor workouts today.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Reroute Around Markets:** If you're planning a run or walk around the Pier View Way area today, seriously consider a different route. The Farmers Market and Sunset Market will make navigation a nightmare, especially during peak hours. Head south towards the Harbor or hit up the San Luis Rey River Trail for an uninterrupted flow.
</AlertBox>

Enjoy the decent weather, but be smart about where and how you push it. Your lungs and joints will thank you later.
