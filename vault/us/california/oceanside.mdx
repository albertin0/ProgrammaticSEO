Alright, Oceanside, listen up. Today's not bad, not great, but definitely workable if you know where to avoid the mess.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Clear skies and a mild 17.6°C (that's pushing 64°F for you Fahrenheit die-hards) mean you won't be melting or freezing out there.
*   Pollen is thankfully playing nice today, sitting at a low level, so your sinuses might actually give you a break.
*   However, our Air Quality Index is hanging in the "Moderate" zone at 55, with fine particulate matter as the main culprit. If you've got sensitive lungs, you'll feel this one.
</BulletList>

## The Rundown

Look, I get it. You want to hit the pavement, get some miles in, or just enjoy the fact that it's *not* a miserable swamp out there. And for the most part, you can. The weather is prime for a run or a walk along the coast. But don't go thinking it's all sunshine and rainbows.

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

While it's not "apocalyptic smog," an AQI of 55 due to fine particulate matter means anyone with respiratory issues, or if you're planning a seriously intense session, should probably take it down a notch. We all want to PR, but not at the expense of our lungs. Consider sticking to routes further from major traffic arteries if you can.

### Local Havoc: The Pier and Downtown Shuffle

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### Oceanside Pier: Still a Ghost Town After the Fire
That fire back in '24 really did a number, and while they're working on it, the Oceanside Pier is still undergoing demolition and reconstruction. Don't expect to run its full length or find Ruby's at the end. It's a no-go for your usual scenic pier sprint, and honestly, you shouldn't be anywhere near active construction zones anyway. Find another turnaround point.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Downtown Oceanside: Construction Zone Ahead
If your usual route takes you through the heart of Downtown Oceanside, be aware that the "Downtown Water and Sewer Replacement Phase II Project" kicked off earlier this year and is ongoing. This means potential detours, noisy machinery, and general inconvenience. Keep your head on a swivel, watch for heavy equipment, and maybe plan an alternative route to avoid the headaches. Your joints don't need unexpected potholes or uneven surfaces, and your ears don't need jackhammers.
</AlertBox>

On the upside, there's no major wind advisory today, and despite the recent discussions about federal funding for the San Luis Rey River Project to mitigate flood risks, there are no current flooding warnings or active issues in Oceanside. We're also clear on the wildfire front, with a low fire risk forecast for today.

### Final Thoughts
So yeah, get out there. The mild weather is too good to waste. Just be smart about where you're putting your feet and what you're breathing in. Your body will thank you later.
