If you're looking to push yourself, today might not be your PR day, but a solid moderate effort on the trails should be fine for most.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  *   **Air Quality is Moderate:** AQI is clocking in at 65, with inhalable particulate matter (PM10/PM2.5) as the dominant pollutant. This means if your lungs are easily annoyed, or you're one of our younger or older runners, you might want to scale back that intense tempo run on the Pacific Electric Trail.
  *   **Perfect Running Weather:** Seriously, 17.1°C (that's about 63°F for the Fahrenheit folks) and clear skies? You couldn't ask for much better weather to be outside. The afternoon might warm up a bit into the low 80s, but it's still clear and pleasant.
  *   **Low Pollen Count:** Allergies won't be kicking your butt today, which is a rare win for those of us who usually spend half our run sniffing like a bloodhound.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality Details

<AlertBox type="warning">
  For an AQI of 65, classified as "Moderate," sensitive groups (children, older adults, and anyone with lung disease like asthma) should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. It's not a stay-indoors day for everyone, but listen to your body, especially if you fall into one of those categories.

### What to Watch Out For in Fontana Today

No major fires are currently impacting Fontana, and the seasonal fire outlook improved to near-normal levels in early 2026 for Southern California, which is a relief given our usual dry conditions. Wind speeds are expected to be light, so no surprise gusts to knock you off balance on your morning constitutional.

There aren't any specific trail closures or massive construction projects that popped up in the last 24 hours directly blocking popular running routes like the Pacific Electric Trail. The city does have ongoing street improvement projects, but nothing signaling a workout hazard for today. And don't worry, the Fontana Days Run is still months away in June, so no mass road closures from that just yet.

<AlertBox type="info">
  With clear skies and comfortable temperatures, remember to stay hydrated. Even if it doesn't feel scorching, your body still loses fluids, especially when you're working hard. Carry water, or plan your route to hit up one of Fontana's many parks, like Fontana Park, if you need a refill.
</AlertBox>

Overall, it's a decent day to get out there, but be mindful of that moderate air quality if your respiratory system is a drama queen. Keep it steady, enjoy the weather, and your lungs will probably forgive you.
