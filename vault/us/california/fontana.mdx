Alright Fontana, step outside if you dare. It looks clear, but don't let that pretty blue sky fool you into thinking it's an easy day for a PR.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Heat is ON:** We're looking at temps in the mid-80s (Fahrenheit, for those of you still clinging to Celsius) today, climbing to a scorching 90°F tomorrow. This isn't your grandma's mild February.
*   **Sneaky Air:** While the official AQI is sitting at 49, AccuWeather is flagging our air quality as "Poor" with a value of 53, and specifically "unhealthy for sensitive groups" due to particulate matter. Don't gloss over that.
*   **Wind Advisory, Kinda:** We'll get some decent west winds this afternoon, potentially gusting up to 20 mph overnight into Friday. That's enough to turn a calm long run on the Pacific Electric Trail into an unexpected headwind battle.

## Today's Nitty-Gritty

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Watch the Mercury, Seriously
With temperatures hitting 85-86°F today and pushing 90°F on Friday, you're looking at prime conditions for heat exhaustion. You think you're tough, but your physiology doesn't care about your Strava segment. If you're running, especially anything longer than a quick dash, hydrate like it's your job and listen to your body. No PBs are worth ending up in the ER at Kaiser Permanente Fontana.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Don't Breathe Deeply (If You're Sensitive)
The AQI, while numerically "Good" at 49, comes with a big asterisk. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, and other sources are calling today's air "unhealthy for sensitive groups." If you have asthma, COPD, or just generally hate coughing up a lung after a run, maybe take it indoors today. Or, at the very least, stick to a walk. Your respiratory system will thank you.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Beat the Heat, Dodge the Wind
Your best bet for an outdoor workout today is *early* morning, before the sun really starts baking the asphalt, or much *later* in the evening once things cool down a bit. This also helps you dodge the higher winds expected later tonight and into tomorrow. Plan accordingly if you're hitting the Pacific Electric Trail – that open stretch between Sierra and Citrus can be brutal with a crosswind.

There haven't been any recent reports of major trail closures or surprise events blocking your usual routes in Fontana within the last 24 hours. So, the paths are clear, but the conditions are dicey.
