Look, if you're hitting the pavement in Fontana today, February 28th, you're not going to melt, but don't expect perfectly crisp air either.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering in the "moderate" zone, thanks to those pesky inhalable particulates. You might not see it, but your lungs will feel it, especially if you're pushing the pace.
*   Temperatures are pleasant, sitting around 19.5°C (that's 67°F for the Fahrenheit crowd), with clear skies. Great for keeping those joints happy and not overheating.
*   Pollen is low, so at least your sinuses get a break from the usual seasonal assault.

## Your Fontana Forecast: Moderate Air, Good Temps, and Watch Your Step

Alright, Fontana runners, it's a mixed bag out there today. The good news is, we're not dealing with any insane heat or unexpected downpours. The weather apps are calling for a clear day around 19.5°C (67°F), which is pretty much ideal for getting those miles in without feeling like you're running through a swamp or a blast furnace. Your knees and ankles will appreciate the mild conditions.

### Inhalable Particulates are Your Lung's Frenemy

Here's the rub: our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 58, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. This means there's enough crud floating around in the air to potentially irritate your respiratory system. If you're someone who gets winded easily, has asthma, or just prefers not to breathe in microscopic grit, today might be the day to dial it back a notch, especially during peak traffic hours. I'm talking about anyone planning an intense session along the 210 Freeway, where that kind of stuff just hangs in the air.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory:** With moderate air quality, sensitive individuals should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Everyone else, be mindful of any unusual breathing discomfort.

### Foothill Boulevard: Still a Work in Progress

Now, about local hazards. While there are no new, sudden trail closures or wildfire smoke alerts for Fontana today, you always need to be aware of ongoing construction. The city has been investing in infrastructure, especially along major arteries like Foothill Boulevard, to "enhance pedestrian accessibility and foster stronger connections between residents and local businesses."

Yes, that means they're trying to fix those "major dip sections" on Foothill Boulevard that make you feel like you're trail running when you're just trying to cross the street. While these projects are ultimately for our benefit, they can still mean unexpected detours, uneven surfaces, or increased vehicle traffic in certain areas. Keep your head up and stay aware, particularly if your route takes you anywhere near these improvement zones, or if you're hopping off the Pacific Electric Trail to grab a quick snack. No sense in twisting an ankle on a freshly dug trench because you were glued to your Strava.

**Local Tip:** Always keep an eye on official City of Fontana updates for construction zones, especially if your regular routes include busy streets or areas undergoing infrastructure improvements. A quick check can save you a reroute mid-run.

### Pollen Report: A Rare Win!

On the bright side, pollen levels are low. So, if your usual spring workout involves a battle with allergies and a constant drip from your nose, today's your day to breathe a little easier—at least from that perspective.

In short, it's a decent day to run, just be smart about the air you're breathing and the ground you're covering near construction. Don't push too hard with those particulates, and always be aware of your surroundings, especially on busy Fontana streets.
