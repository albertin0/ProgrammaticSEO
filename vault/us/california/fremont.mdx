This morning, Fremont, you've got a mixed bag, so don't just blindly hit the trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
-   **The Good News:** The weather is absolutely gorgeous at 14.5°C (58°F) and clear. Perfect running temps. Pollen levels are blessedly low.
-   **The Not-So-Great News:** Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 83, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. "Moderate" on the scale, sure, but your lungs might have other opinions, especially if you're pushing hard.
-   **The Usual Suspects:** No major wildfire smoke or crazy storms, thankfully. Just the ongoing dance with construction.
</BulletList>

Look, the sun's out, the temperature is primo, and the allergies aren't trying to murder you. But before you go attempting a new PR around Lake Elizabeth, let's talk about that air.

Your local air quality data shows an AQI of 83, and it's the ozone you need to worry about. Ozone isn't like that visible smog from a bad inversi&amp;oacute;n day; it's a gas, and it's particularly nasty for your respiratory system. It can trigger coughing, throat irritation, and chest pain, and if you’ve got any underlying lung issues, you’ll feel it more acutely. Even healthy individuals can experience difficulty breathing with prolonged exposure. So, while the weather invites you to go all out, your lungs might beg to differ. It's a classic Fremont February dilemma: lovely weather, questionable air.

### Local Hazards & Tips

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Ozone Alert for Sensitive Groups
With an AQI of 83 driven by ozone, individuals with respiratory conditions like asthma, children, and the elderly should consider scaling back intense or prolonged outdoor activity. Listen to your body – if you start feeling any irritation, cut your workout short. This isn't the day to try and run up Mission Peak if you're prone to lung irritation.

### Walnut Avenue Construction Continues
Heads up for those navigating downtown: construction on Walnut Avenue, between Paseo Padre Parkway and Fremont Boulevard, is still chugging along. Expect temporary lane closures, sidewalk closures, and limited parking during typical working hours (7:30 AM to 4:00 PM, Monday-Friday). If your route usually takes you through there, plan an alternate or be prepared for some detours and dusty conditions. It's expected to continue through Summer 2026.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Ragweed     | Low   |
| **Overall** | **Low** |

Honestly, today's one of those days where you feel great stepping outside, but might regret it an hour into your run. Prioritize recovery and maybe keep that hard effort for an indoor session or a day with cleaner air. Your lungs will thank you, and as a PT, trust me, you want those lungs functioning properly for the long haul.
