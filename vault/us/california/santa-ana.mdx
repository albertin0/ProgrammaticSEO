Alright, Santa Ana, another day, another attempt to squeeze in a run without hitting a new pothole or inhaling last week's exhaust. Today's not terrible, but don't expect perfection.

<BulletList>
*   **The Good Stuff:** Low pollen counts mean your sinuses get a break, and that 16.2C (61F for those who aren't Celsius-savvy) under a clear sky? Pretty ideal for getting outside. No excuses on the temperature front.
*   **The Air:** Your lungs might feel it a bit. AQI is hanging around 70, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It’s not "shelter in place" bad, but if you've got asthma or are just generally sensitive, you might notice it on longer efforts. This isn't exactly the crisp mountain air we all dream of, but hey, it's Santa Ana.
*   **Trail Treachery:** If your usual long run involves the Santa Ana River Trail, prepare for some creative navigation. Those levee rehabilitation projects between Riverside Avenue/Main Street and Columbia Avenue mean detours are still a thing through July. Seriously, plan ahead or you'll be doing extra mileage just trying to find your way around.

### Santa Ana River Trail Detours
Heads up, runners and cyclists: sections of the Santa Ana River Trail, specifically between Riverside Avenue/Main Street and Columbia Avenue, are currently detoured. This isn't new news, but it's ongoing until July 2026 for those "vital flood protection improvements." Don't just blindly follow your usual route; check local signage or you'll be adding an unplanned adventure to your workout. Expect some slowdowns and potential frustration.

### Ozone and Your Lungs
With ozone as the main culprit in today's moderate AQI, consider the timing of your workout. Ozone tends to peak in the afternoon, so if you're sensitive, an early morning session might be a little kinder to your respiratory system. It's not a deal-breaker for most, but why push it if you don't have to?
</AlertBox>

Overall, today's a decent enough day to get out there, provided you're not planning a record-breaking speed attempt along the River Trail's construction zones. The weather's pleasant, pollen's low, and the air's acceptable if not pristine. Just keep an eye on your surroundings and don't let those detours completely derail your mileage goals.
