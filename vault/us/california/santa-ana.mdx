Another day in Santa Ana, another set of hoops to jump through if you want to get your sweat on outside without ending up in my office.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Ozone's Back, Baby!** Our old friend, Ozone, is making the air "moderate" today. Great for the plants, not so much for your lungs if you're pushing it.
*   **Construction Zone Blues:** Remember that smooth ride on the Santa Ana River Trail? Yeah, that's still a pipe dream in some sections, with detours and rough patches aplenty.
*   **Warm & Fuzzy, But Watch the Hydration:** Nice and clear, but 24°C isn't exactly chilly. Don't be that person collapsing at Santiago Creek because you thought a single water bottle would cut it.
</BulletList>

Look, the sun's out, which is usually a green light for me, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. The overall Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 71, with Ozone being the dominant jerk in the atmosphere. For most of us, this just means a slightly scratchy throat if you're hammering out intervals. But if you're one of my asthmatic patients or prone to lung irritation, today's the day to maybe scale back that effort or hit the treadmill. "Sensitive groups may experience minor to moderate symptoms from long-term exposure," so, you know, listen to your body before you try to impress anyone.

Speaking of listening, you might want to listen to the detour signs, especially if you're planning a long ride or run on the **Santa Ana River Trail**. OC Public Works is still doing remedial repairs between Weir Canyon Road/La Palma Avenue and Lincoln Avenue through February, and they're not exactly rolling out the red carpet. You'll be walking your bike around work sites, which isn't exactly the flow state you're looking for on a long haul. And get this, some levee rehabilitation projects further up the river are causing detours until July 2026. So, unless you enjoy an obstacle course, plan your route meticulously or just stick to the roads where you know the construction updates from the City of Santa Ana's latest bulletins.

It's clear and warm, around 24°C, which feels great at first, but remember that the sun and ozone don't play nice. Humidity is at 47%, so it won't feel too muggy, but still, hydrate before, during, and after. Don't rely on those sad little water fountains that are probably broken anyway.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |

| Weeds       | None  |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI is Moderate (71 AQI):** Ozone is elevated. If you have respiratory sensitivities, consider reducing prolonged or high-intensity outdoor activity. Today isn't the day to find out if your lungs are tougher than Santa Ana's air.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction on Santa Ana River Trail:** Expect ongoing maintenance and potential detours between Weir Canyon Road/La Palma Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. Cyclists, be prepared to dismount and walk. Check OC Parks alerts for the latest closures.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration is Key:** With temperatures around 24°C, even though it's clear, you'll still sweat. Carry more water than you think you need, especially if you're out for more than an hour. Nobody wants to deal with heat exhaustion.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, folks, be smart out there. Your knees and lungs will thank you.
