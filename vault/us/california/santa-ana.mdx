It's a "choose your adventure, and that adventure might involve detours" kind of day in Santa Ana. The weather is playing nice, but the city itself is still under construction.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
-   **Clear skies and pleasant temps:** Clocking in at a comfortable 19.3°C (that's about 67°F for those of you still clinging to Fahrenheit), it's ideal weather for getting outside.
-   **Moderate AQI, watch those lungs:** With an Air Quality Index of 68, it's sitting squarely in the "moderate" zone. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), which means dusty air. If you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel this.
-   **Pollen? What pollen?** Good news for allergy sufferers, the pollen count is currently low. Breathe easy on that front.
-   **Construction, construction everywhere:** From the Santa Ana River Trail to major intersections, the city is a minefield of cones and caution tape. Plan your routes, folks.
</BulletList>

Look, the sunshine and mild air are tempting, but don't just blindly hit your usual route, especially if that route involves anything near a major road or our beloved Santa Ana River Trail.

## The Great Santa Ana Construction Shuffle

If you were planning a long run or ride along the **Santa Ana River Trail**, get ready for some rerouting. There are ongoing closures and detours in effect for the Riverside Levees Rehabilitation Project, which will last until July 2026. Specifically, expect to navigate detours between Riverside Ave./Main St. and Columbia Ave., and near the Market St. Bridge and CA 60. On top of that, OC Public Works is doing maintenance repairs on other sections of the trail between Weir Canyon Road/La Palma Avenue and Lincoln Avenue through the end of February. Translation: you *can* still use it, but you'll be dodging barriers and probably adding a few unplanned miles. My advice? Check OC Parks alerts or local city websites *before* you head out.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail & Road Closures Are No Joke:** Expect major disruptions on the Santa Ana River Trail and various city streets. Specifically, keep an eye out for nightly lane reductions on Bristol Street and Memory Lane for pipeline construction, daily lane closures on Standard Avenue between First and McFadden for bike lane construction, and ongoing work on Civic Center Drive for a safety improvement project. There are also *overnight* closures on Walnut Avenue south of Jeffrey Road tonight (Feb 26, 11 p.m. to Feb 27, 5 a.m.) for bridge construction. Don't be "that runner" who holds up traffic because you didn't check.

## Your Lungs vs. The Dust

The AQI being 68 with PM10 as the dominant pollutant means there's a fair bit of "stuff" in the air. Could be construction dust, could be general city grime. For most folks, a moderate AQI isn't a showstopper, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or just feel generally crummy when the air isn't pristine, maybe dial back the intensity or shorten your workout. This isn't the day to try and PR your 10k.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration is Key (Always, But Especially Now):** Clear weather combined with moderate air quality and a decent temperature means you can still get dehydrated. Keep that water bottle full, even if it doesn't feel scorchingly hot. It'll help with lung irritation too.

### Final Word

It's a decent day if you're flexible and smart about it. Stick to less congested areas if the moderate AQI bugs you, and for the love of all that is holy, know your route's construction situation. Or, you know, find an indoor gym. 24 Hour Fitness on Tustin is always... an option.
