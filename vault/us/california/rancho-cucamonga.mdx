Alright, Rancho Cucamonga, let's talk about hitting the trails or pounding the pavement today. Honestly? It's a mixed bag, so don't just blindly lace up and head out without a quick check.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Weather's a Gem (mostly):** Temperatures are hovering around a pleasant 19.6°C (67°F) with clear skies. Pollen's on the down-low, which is a win for anyone not wanting to sneeze their way through a PR attempt.
*   **AQI's Got Issues:** That "moderate" Air Quality Index of 58? It's driven by inhalable particulate matter. Your lungs aren't going to love crushing intervals in that.
*   **Mountain Goat Aspirations on Hold:** If your weekend plans involved scaling anything near Mount Baldy, think again. Those trails are locked down.
</BulletList>

Today's shaping up to be one of those days where the weather *looks* fantastic, luring you outside, but there are some hidden catches. That clear sky is sitting over a moderate AQI, thanks to all that fine particulate matter floating around. It’s not a "stay indoors at all costs" scenario, but if you've got sensitive lungs or were planning an all-out effort, you might want to dial it back a notch. Consider easing up on the pace or sticking to less exposed areas.

Now, for those of us who prefer elevation to asphalt, I've got some bad news. The Angeles National Forest has extended temporary closures for several National Forest System trails in the Mount Baldy (Mount San Antonio) area, effective from February 27 through March 20, 2026. This isn't just a suggestion; it's for public safety, and it includes popular spots like Mt. Baldy Trail, Devils Backbone Trail, and Icehouse Canyon Trail. Don't be that person who ignores the signs and ends up needing a rescue because you thought you knew better. Seriously, your Strava segment can wait.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Mount Baldy Area Trails are CLOSED!
Do NOT attempt to access trails like Mt. Baldy Trail, Devils Backbone Trail, or Icehouse Canyon Trail. This closure is for public safety and is in effect until March 20, 2026.

On the bright side, with low pollen counts, your allergies should be pretty chill today. So, if you're sticking to lower elevation routes, like a cruise along sections of the Pacific Electric Trail, you'll probably enjoy the crisp-ish air and sunshine without the constant sniffles. Just keep an eye out for any local construction activity, as the city has ongoing "Active Transportation and Safety Improvements" planned, and there's general site work for new developments like Vinova between Wilson and Etiwanda Avenues. These can mean unexpected detours or uneven surfaces.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate AQI: Listen to Your Lungs
With an AQI of 58 and inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, consider reducing intense outdoor activity. Pay attention to how your body feels, especially if you have respiratory sensitivities.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today's workout isn't a write-off, but it requires a bit of intelligence. Pick your poison: either a slightly easier effort in the urban sprawl, or take your workout indoors if those mountain trails were your only plan.

### Watch for Urban Obstacles
Ongoing construction for active transportation improvements and new developments can create unexpected detours or uneven surfaces on city routes. Stay aware of your surroundings and plan your urban runs accordingly.
