Today? If you're chasing that runner's high, be smart about it, because Rancho's throwing some real curveballs this late February.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" weather might be hiding a bit of a particulate problem, and the mercury is climbing way too high for comfort this time of year.
*   Forget about your usual route through parts of **Heritage Community Park**; they're still in the middle of a bridge overhaul, rerouting foot and hoof traffic.
*   A moderate wildfire risk is sticking around, just to keep us on our toes.
</BulletList>

## Lungs & Joints Breakdown

Let's cut to the chase. The air quality isn't doing your lungs any favors, clocking in at a moderate 56 AQI. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, which means tiny crap floating around that your lungs would rather not deal with. You might not *see* a heavy haze, but your respiratory system will feel it if you push too hard. On the flip side, pollen is currently low, so at least your allergies might get a break.

### Don't Let the Sun Fool You: It's Hot Out There
Seriously, an 85°F high in late February? That's ridiculous. While your internal temperature regulation might be begging for some sunshine after the gloomy winter, this is pushing it. Dehydration and heat exhaustion are real risks, especially if you're out pounding the pavement on the Pacific Electric Trail in the middle of the day. And if you're not well-hydrated, your joints are going to feel every single mile a lot more. Light and variable winds won't do much to cool you down either.

### Trail Status & Local Annoyances

If you had plans to ride or run through the equestrian facilities at Heritage Community Park, you're out of luck. The Heritage Park Bridge project means access over Demens Creek Channel to those arenas is closed for construction until April 2026. So, while the park itself is open, some of your usual loops are off-limits, which means more pavement or finding alternative, potentially crowded, routes.

Also, for those mountain goats among us, the forest area of Cucamonga Canyon, including the popular (and frequently ignored) Sapphire Falls, remains officially closed through May 2026. Don't be "that guy" who thinks the rules don't apply to them; trespassing for a selfie isn't worth a fine or worse.

And while the major rain events are behind us, trails were closed for wet and muddy conditions as recently as February 22nd in nearby areas. Expect to encounter some lingering muddy patches, especially on less-trafficked dirt trails. Nothing ruins a good run like a twisted ankle from a surprise mud slick.

### Your Best Bet Today
If you absolutely *must* get out, hit it early morning or late evening to dodge that unseasonable heat. Stick to paved surfaces like the Rancho Cucamonga Community Trail where you're less likely to find surprise mud pits. Hydrate aggressively, and maybe reconsider that long tempo run. A moderate fire risk is also in play, so keep an eye out and report anything suspicious.

Honestly, today's an inside-the-gym or chill-at-home-with-some-mobility-work kind of day. Your lungs and joints will thank you.
