If you're lacing up in Stockton today, you're looking at some decent temps, but don't get too complacent—the air isn't exactly crisp.

<LungsJointsScore score={6.5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Just Okay, Not Great:** With an AQI of 75, we're squarely in "Moderate" territory. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). While the air *feels* clear, sensitive lungs might notice it after a long run. AccuWeather corroborates this, stating that while generally acceptable, sensitive groups might experience minor to moderate symptoms from long-term exposure.
*   **Morning Fog Advisory for the Region:** Despite our "Clear" skies right now, the National Weather Service for the San Joaquin Valley specifically warned that dense fog would be returning this Saturday morning. If you're an early bird hitting the pavement around the Calaveras River Trail, keep an eye on visibility.
*   **Perfect Running Temperatures:** The mercury's sitting at a comfortable 15.9°C (that's about 61°F for you Fahrenheit folks). Your joints will thank you for this spring-like weather, a welcome break from the extremes.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

<AlertBox type="warning">
### AQI: Moderate (75) - Mind Your Lungs!
The Air Quality Index is at a moderate 75, with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. This isn't horrible, but it's not ideal. If you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally cranky lungs, consider shortening your outdoor session or swapping that long run for some indoor strength work. Pay attention to your breathing; don't push through discomfort.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Watch for Dense Fog (Especially This Morning)
While the immediate forecast is clear, the NWS issued an advisory for dense fog returning to the San Joaquin Valley this Saturday morning. If you're out there before the sun fully burns it off, especially near the river or open fields, be extra cautious. Wear bright colors, reflective gear, and assume drivers can't see you. Better yet, delay your run until later if it's thick.

### I-5 Construction in Stockton is Underway (Indirect Impact)
The Interstate 5 Stockton Channel Viaduct Replacement Project is officially beginning this year, a massive undertaking that will affect the I-5 corridor from post miles 26.1 to 27.6. While this won't directly close most running trails, expect potential traffic disruptions, increased construction vehicle presence, and localized noise or emissions near I-5 access points, like those around Louis Park or downtown Stockton routes. Plan your longer runs with this in mind to avoid unnecessary exposure or frustration.
