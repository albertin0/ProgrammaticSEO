Alright, Stockton. February 26th. Today's not going to kill you, but it's not exactly going to make you feel like you just ran through a pine forest, either.

<LungsJointsScore score={6.5} />

<BulletList>
*   Your lungs are going to be working a bit harder today. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "moderate" 90, and that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the dominant pollutant. Don't let the clear skies fool you; that stuff gets deep in there.
*   Pollen is blessedly low, so at least your nose won't be staging a rebellion.
*   Temperatures are mild at 16.1°C (61°F), which is great for getting some miles in, but stay aware of your surroundings, especially if you're hitting quieter spots like parts of the Calaveras River Bike Path.

</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe

Let's talk about that air. While a 90 AQI is technically "moderate," don't get complacent. "Moderate" often means it's unhealthy for sensitive groups, and that dominant fine particulate matter is the real kicker. It's tiny enough to bypass your body's natural defenses and can irritate your respiratory system, even if you're a regular iron-lunged runner.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Low pollen is a win, plain and simple. Enjoy it while it lasts.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory: Don't Push It Too Hard.**
With fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant and an AQI of 90, sensitive individuals (asthmatics, elderly, children) should seriously consider scaling back or moving their workout indoors. If you're feeling any chest tightness or unusual shortness of breath, listen to your body and cut it short.

## Local Hazards & Things To Know

**Crime:** Stockton news reports are, unfortunately, a consistent reminder to stay vigilant. There have been multiple reports of police activity and violent crime in the city recently, including shootings and other incidents in different neighborhoods. While not directly on your running path, it's a general safety reminder. Keep your headphones low, stay aware of who's around you, and avoid sketchy areas, especially if you're out alone or after dark.

**Construction:** Expect the usual city construction. While I haven't seen any specific new *trail* closures for the Calaveras River Bike Path or major city parks reported in the last 24 hours, general road work and detours are always a possibility around town. If you're running on sidewalks or along streets, keep an eye out for "Slow for the Cone Zone" signs and unexpected diversions. No one needs a sprained ankle from an unmarked trench.

**Always Tell Someone Your Route!**
Seriously, it's not just for newbies. Whether you're doing laps at Louis Park or hitting the longer stretches of the Calaveras River path, give a friend or family member a heads-up on where you're going and when you expect to be back. It's smart, not paranoid.

Today's workout is a go, but bring your street smarts and pay attention to how your lungs feel. It's not a day to set a PR if your chest is feeling tight.
