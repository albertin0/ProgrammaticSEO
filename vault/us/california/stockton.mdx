Alright, Stockton, it's a mixed bag out there for your Thursday workout, but mostly leaning towards "meh" if you care about what you're breathing.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Your lungs are on notice:** The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Poor" 88 today, with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) as the dominant pollutant. This isn't just for the asthmatics; anyone pushing themselves is going to feel it.
*   **Weather's playing nice (mostly):** Temperatures are a perfectly comfortable 14.7°C (mid-50s to low 70s F throughout the day), with clear skies after any patchy morning fog burns off. No extreme heat, no arctic blast.
*   **Pollen's taking a break:** Allergy sufferers can rejoice – pollen levels are mercifully low.
*   **Watch your step (and your route):** Construction is a constant companion in Stockton, especially downtown.

Look, the weather gods are giving us a break. A pleasant 14.7°C and clear skies? That's prime running weather for February in Stockton. You could hit the pavement along the Calaveras River Bicycle Trail and enjoy the lack of wind trying to blow you into the Delta. But before you lace up those Hokas and head out the door, take a deep breath. Actually, maybe *don't* take a deep breath just yet.

## Air Quality: Your Lungs Deserve Better

The big caveat today is our air quality. The AQI is clocking in at 88, which officially puts us in the "Poor" category. We're talking about inhalable particulate matter (PM10) being the main culprit here, meaning tiny bits of crap floating around that your lungs would rather not deal with. If you've got any kind of respiratory issues – asthma, COPD, or you just don't like coughing up a lung after a tempo run – consider cutting your outdoor session short or taking it indoors. Hell, even if you're a young, healthy ironman, prolonged heavy exertion in this stuff isn't doing you any favors in the long run. Stockton and San Joaquin County are "non-attainment" areas for several air pollutants, so this isn't exactly a shocker, but it's still a hazard to acknowledge.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI is Poor (88) due to PM10.** Sensitive groups (children, older adults, those with lung conditions) should *avoid* prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. Everyone else, reduce it. This isn't just a suggestion; it's basic self-preservation.

## Construction: The Ever-Present Obstacle Course

While there haven't been any *new* massive trail closures reported in the last 24 hours specifically for runners, remember that Stockton always has *something* going on. Downtown, for example, the East Channel Street Streetscape and Connectivity Project is likely underway, meaning sidewalks, bike lanes, and general traffic flow could be impacted. Various Public Works projects are ongoing across the city. If your route takes you near major thoroughfares or through recently developed areas, stay vigilant.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Always be aware of local construction.** Roads are being worked on for active transportation, bike lanes, and general improvements. Keep an eye out for "Slow for the Cone Zone" signs, unexpected detours, and uneven surfaces, especially if you're heading near downtown Stockton or main arteries.

## Weather & Pollen: A Glimmer of Hope

On the brighter side, we're not dealing with any extreme weather. No triple-digit heat, no freezing rain, no gale-force winds to speak of. While the search results mentioned patchy fog possible this morning before clearing, your workout window later today should be clear and comfortable. And if you're one of those poor souls who usually spends spring sniffling and sneezing, today's low pollen count is a small victory.

So, go ahead and get your miles in, but be smart about it. That PM10 is no joke. Maybe opt for an easier pace, or find an indoor option today. Your lungs will thank you.
