Alright, Stockton, let's talk. Today is one of those days where your lungs might throw a fit, but your joints will probably thank you for the mild weather.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI? Yeah, it's creeping into "moderate" territory thanks to those delightful inhalable particulates. Your breathing might feel a little heavier than usual.
*   Temperature is sitting pretty at a comfortable 20.1°C (68°F), so no excuses about freezing your assets or melting into the pavement.
*   Pollen count is blessedly low, so at least your sinuses get a break, even if your lungs are working overtime.

## The Lowdown on Lungbusters & Less-Than-Ideal Air

Look, nobody wants to be breathing in microscopic crud. An AQI of 82 isn't "stay indoors and hermetically seal yourself," but it's definitely not "take a deep, cleansing breath and feel amazing" territory. Your body is working harder to filter that stuff out. If you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity – asthma, seasonal cough, or just hate feeling gassed for no good reason – consider dialing back the intensity. Maybe skip those sprints along the Calaveras River Bike Trail today and opt for a brisk walk instead. You're trying to build fitness, not become a human air filter.

### Environmental Breakdown

| Pollutant           | Level   |
| :------------------ | :------ |
| General Pollen      | Low     |
| AQI                 | 82      |
| Dominant Pollutant  | PM10    |
| Temperature         | 20.1°C  |
| Condition           | Clear   |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Air Quality Alert:** With an AQI of 82 driven by inhalable particulate matter (PM10), those with respiratory issues should proceed with caution. Healthy individuals might feel some effects during prolonged exertion. It's not a smoke-out, but it's not crystal clear either.

**Hydration is Key (Always!):** Even though it's not scorching, good hydration helps your body's systems, including your respiratory one, function more efficiently. Chug that water before, during, and after your workout.

## Road Blocks & What's Not Out There

Good news on the large-scale disaster front for Stockton: no raging wildfires, no major flooding advisories, and the high winds that occasionally whip through the valley aren't making headlines for today. However, if you're driving to your favorite spot, be aware that some routine (or not-so-routine) roadwork is still happening around San Joaquin County. Corral Hollow Road and Valpico Road, for instance, have ongoing construction closures through Friday morning. While this might not directly impact your run on the Calaveras, it's a reminder that getting to and from your workout might involve a detour or two. Check the county road closure updates before you head out, especially if your route takes you outside the city's main drag.

**County Road Construction:** Be mindful of active road construction and potential delays on routes like Corral Hollow Road and Valpico Road in San Joaquin County. Plan your commute to the trails accordingly.

Overall, it's a decent day if you manage your respiratory load. The clear skies and mild temps are a gift in February. Just don't push the lung capacity too hard with that moderate AQI hanging around. Listen to your body – it's usually smarter than your ego.
