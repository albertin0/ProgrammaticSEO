Another day, another chance to sweat, or at least consider it. Today in Oxnard? It's a solid "go for it," with a few local caveats you better not ignore if you value your lungs or your knees.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **AQI's a bit spicy:** Air Quality Index is clocking in at 76, with Nitrogen dioxide as the main party pooper. That's "moderate," which means some of you sensitive types might feel it, and even us iron-lunged runners probably aren't getting peak performance.
*   **Foggy Mornings:** Expect some patchy fog, especially near the coast. Yesterday's forecast mentioned dense fog possible for coastal areas through Saturday, so keep your head up. Hard to see that rogue scooter on the bike path when it's like pea soup.
*   **Otherwise, pretty chill:** Low pollen counts mean your allergies can take a break, and the 17.8°C (around 64°F, heading up to a pleasant 73°F later) feels pretty good for a February run. Clear skies are on tap for the day, once that morning marine layer decides to burn off.
</BulletList>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Air Quality Alert
The AQI is currently 76, with nitrogen dioxide as the dominant pollutant. While not terrible, if you've got asthma, respiratory issues, or you're planning an intense session, consider dialing it back or hitting an indoor gym. No need to prove your toughness by huffing bad air.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Watch for Coastal Fog
If you're heading out early along the beaches or near Channel Islands Harbor, visibility might be reduced. Wear bright colors, use lights, and assume no one sees you. Because, let's be real, they probably don't.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Persistent Construction at Rice Ave & Fifth St
That grade separation project at Rice Avenue and Fifth Street? Still ongoing. It’s a multi-year beast meant to improve safety, but in the meantime, expect potential detours, narrowed lanes, and general traffic headaches if your route takes you through or near there. Keep an eye out for heavy equipment and make sure you're visible, especially if you're on two wheels or your own two feet. This isn't just about traffic; it's about not becoming part of the construction.
