Alright, Oxnard, let's talk turkey. Today is one of those classic "California dreamin'" days where the weather *looks* perfect, but if you're actually paying attention, you know better.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**AQI ain't great for your respiratory system.** While it's not red-alert bad, an AQI of 63 with inhalable particulate matter means your lungs are doing extra work. Don't pretend you're an Ironman if your airways are feeling crunchy.</li>
  <li>**The temperature is damn near perfect.** 20.5°C and clear skies? That's prime running weather. No excuses for being a couch potato.</li>
  <li>**Still gotta watch those trails, even if it's been a few days since the last drizzle.** Remember that old advice: for every inch of rain, give dirt trails a day to dry out. Some of those less-maintained paths could still be a muddy mess, and nobody likes a twisted ankle or erosion.</li>
</BulletList>

### Lungs & Air Quality

Look, the "Clear" skies are deceiving. While you won't see smoke from a wildfire (thank goodness, no local blazes reported in the last 24 hours), that AQI of 63 isn't exactly crisp mountain air. It's moderate, and the dominant pollutant being inhalable particulate matter (PM10) means there's just enough crap floating around to make a difference, especially if you've got existing respiratory issues or you're planning a hard effort. You think your lungs don't notice? Your PT is telling you they do.

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Good news for the allergy sufferers: pollen is low. So at least you won't be snotting your way through your run because of blooming flora.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Moderate AQI Means Don't Push It Too Hard.**
  An AQI of 63, driven by PM10, isn't a showstopper, but it's a yellow flag for your lungs. If you're doing a tempo run or intervals, consider backing off slightly or moving it inside. Your long-term lung health will thank you.

### Joints & General Hazards

The temperature is gorgeous, no arguments there. At 20.5°C, you're not battling heatstroke or freezing your digits off. Your joints will appreciate the mild conditions. However, let's talk about the ground you're actually running on.

While Ventura County's road closure maps are thankfully clear right now, it’s worth remembering that just a few days ago, Santa Barbara (which shares weather advisories with Oxnard) was still telling folks to steer clear of wet trails to prevent erosion and injuries. Even with our current clear spell, some of the less-trafficked dirt paths could still be soft or muddy in shaded areas. If you're hitting up the **Ventura River Trail** or any other unpaved sections, keep an eye out. Nobody wants to blow out a knee because they hit a slick patch.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Heads Up Near Channel Islands Harbor.**
  There's ongoing activity around Channel Islands Harbor. While dredging operations are reportedly complete as of February, there are still future projects like the "Harbor Boulevard East Parking Lot Improvement Project" and demolition for "Karl's Village" slated for later this year. Keep an eye out for potential future detours or increased traffic as these projects ramp up. For today, it's mostly about general awareness rather than immediate blocking.
</AlertBox>

Overall, it's a pretty solid day to move your body outside. Just be smart about your effort with that moderate air quality and pick your trail wisely if you're going off-road.
