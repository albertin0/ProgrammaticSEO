Alright Irvine, it's Saturday, February 28, and while the sun's out, don't just blindly hit the trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Today's a "Look Before You Leap" kind of day.** Weather is clear and pretty comfortable, a welcome break from recent storms.
*   **Lungs might get a workout you didn't sign up for.** Air quality is hanging around "Moderate" with enough particulate matter to annoy sensitive folks.
*   **Your favorite dirt paths are likely still off-limits.** Recent heavy rains have many popular trails closed due to muddy conditions.
</BulletList>

## The Rundown

Look, after the drama of the past week with those strong winds and the seemingly endless rain, you might be itching to get out there. The good news: the skies are clear, the temperature is sitting at a pleasant 18.9°C (that's about 66°F for those of us who still think in Fahrenheit), and pollen counts are low. Sounds idyllic, right? Almost.

### Air Quality & Your Lungs

Here’s the catch. While the wind advisory from yesterday has officially expired, the air quality isn't exactly sparkling. We're at an AQI of 62, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. Now, 62 usually means "Moderate," but some forecasts are throwing around phrases like "poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups" for Irvine today due to particle pollution. Personally, if you've got lungs that complain, maybe stick to indoor cardio or keep your outdoor efforts mellow. This isn't wildfire smoke, but it's not mountain-fresh air either.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### AQI Alert: Exercise Caution!
With an AQI of 62 and particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, individuals with respiratory issues, children, and older adults should consider limiting prolonged or intense outdoor activity. Check your own symptoms and listen to your body.

### Trail Status: Muddy Mess Ahead

This is the big one. Those recent rainstorms weren't just a quick shower; they soaked everything. The **Irvine Ranch Open Space** has trails closed due to wet and muddy conditions, an alert that's been active for a while now and reiterates the need for patience. Same goes for the Wilderness Area Pathways at **Mason Regional Park** and **Thomas F. Riley Wilderness Park**. When trails are muddy, running on them causes erosion and damage that can lead to *longer* closures. Seriously, don't be that person who leaves deep ruts for everyone else to deal with. Give them a chance to dry out. The Irvine Ranch Conservancy has been pretty clear about why this matters.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail Closures: Stay Off the Mud!
Many dirt trails throughout the Irvine Ranch Open Space, including areas in Mason Regional Park, are **CLOSED** due to wet and muddy conditions from recent storms. Respect these closures to prevent further damage and ensure trails can reopen sooner.
</AlertBox>

### Construction & Commutes

Irvine is always under construction, it seems. There are ongoing projects like the Jeffrey Open Space Trail (JOST) Bicycle & Pedestrian Bridge project, which saw overnight closures on Walnut Avenue near Jeffrey Road as recently as yesterday morning. While those specific overnight closures are likely done, anticipate general construction activity in the area if you're planning a run or ride that way. The Jamboree & Main Intersection is also getting enhancements through August.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Construction Zone Awareness
If your route takes you near the Jeffrey Open Space Trail or the Jamboree & Main intersection, be aware of ongoing construction. Expect potential intermittent lane closures and detours, and always stay alert for workers and equipment.
