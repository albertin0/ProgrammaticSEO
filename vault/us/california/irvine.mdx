Alright, Irvine, listen up. Today's not terrible, but don't let that "clear skies" forecast lull you into a false sense of security.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Ozone Alert (Sort Of):** Your app might say "Moderate" for air quality, but AccuWeather's screaming "Poor" and to limit outdoor activity, especially if you're sensitive. Ozone isn't your lungs' best friend, so pick your times wisely.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** If you're anywhere near Jamboree & Main, expect the usual lane closures and general roadwork nonsense. Same goes for parts of Walnut Avenue if you're out late.
*   **Good News, Mostly:** At least the pollen's low, and it's not a monsoon out there. Small victories, people.
</BulletList>

## Today's Irvine Grind: Proceed with Caution

Look, I get it. The sun's out, the temperature is a perfectly respectable 15.4°C (that's around 60°F for the Fahrenheit folks), and you want to get your miles in. But this isn't the day to go full throttle without a little reconnaissance.

Your Lungs & Joints score of 6 reflects a mixed bag. While the overall weather is clear and pleasant, we've got some urban irritants you need to factor into your run, ride, or even just your dog walk.

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

The official word is an AQI of 68, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. That's usually "Moderate." However, some forecasts are bumping that up to "Poor" for today, particularly for sensitive groups.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone loves company, and by "company," I mean your lungs.** Ozone is nasty stuff that forms from pollutants cooking in the sun. It can make breathing harder, especially if you're pushing it. If you're prone to respiratory issues, take those warnings seriously. Maybe opt for an indoor workout or head out early morning before the ozone really starts to build.

Here's the pollen breakdown, which at least is something good for a change:

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

### Construction Zones: Your Detour Du Jour

Irvine's always building something, and today's no different. If your route takes you near the **Jamboree Road and Main Street intersection**, prepare for the usual dance of lane closures, which are typically in effect from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays. Cyclists, be extra vigilant; drivers are already distracted enough.

And if you're an evening or early bird hitting the Jeffrey Open Space Trail, be aware of overnight closures on Walnut Avenue south of Jeffrey Road. They're working on that bicycle and pedestrian bridge, so expect disruptions there from 11 p.m. tonight until 5 a.m. tomorrow. Don't get caught in the dark wondering why your usual path is blocked.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Plan your route, check for closures, and consider going off-peak.** An early morning run or late evening stroll might dodge some of the traffic headaches. But even then, keep an eye out for fresh asphalt, shifted cones, and general debris. This city isn't going to hold your hand.
</AlertBox>

No crazy winds kicking up dust today, and the recent rain seems to have mostly dried, so you shouldn't be dealing with muddy trails unless you're way off the beaten path. Just that lingering ozone to contend with.
