Alright Irvine, let's talk turkey about getting your miles in today. It's a surprisingly pleasant day out, but don't let the sunshine fool you into thinking it's all smooth sailing.

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering in the moderate zone, with PM10 being the main culprit, so if your lungs are sensitive, dial it back.
*   Many of our beloved trails in the Irvine Ranch Open Space are still playing hard to get, likely nursing a mud hangover from earlier rains. Don't be "that guy" who ruins it for everyone.
*   The weather's unseasonably warm for February, so plan your hydration and sun protection accordingly.

## The Daily Rundown: February 26, 2026

It's clear skies and a high of around 20.7°C (a balmy 69°F for the Fahrenheit crowd), heading up to almost 79°F later today. Frankly, it's abnormally warm, probably 15 to 20 degrees above what we'd expect this time of year. That's great for breaking a sweat, but also for getting dehydrated if you're not paying attention.

Now, about that air. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at 58, which is officially "Moderate." The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, specifically PM10. This means for most of us, it's fine, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally delicate lungs, you might feel it during prolonged outdoor exertion. We live in the South Coast Air Basin, which is consistently battling state nonattainment for PM10 and PM2.5, so this isn't exactly groundbreaking news, but it's something to keep in mind.

Here's a quick look at the pollen situation, which is, thankfully, not adding to our woes today:

### Trail Talk & Roadblocks

This is where it gets a bit tricky for our trail runners and cyclists. Remember those rains we had a couple of weeks back? Well, many OC Parks trails, including significant portions of the **Irvine Ranch Open Space**, have been closed since at least February 16th due to wet and muddy conditions. And when trails close around here, they usually stay closed until they're genuinely dry to prevent erosion and damage. So, before you head out to bomb down Loma Ridge or cruise through Quail Hill, **check the OC Parks alerts or the City of Irvine Open Space trails website**. Don't be the reason they stay closed longer.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Muddy Trail Mayhem:** Just because it's sunny today doesn't mean the trails are dry. Many paths in the Irvine Ranch Open Space are still recovering from recent rain. Sticking to muddy trails causes serious damage and can lead to longer closures. Check conditions BEFORE you go.
</AlertBox>

On the construction front, if you're near the **Jeffrey Open Space Trail (JOST)**, be aware there are overnight closures of Walnut Avenue south of Jeffrey Road. This is due to construction on the JOST Bicycle & Pedestrian Bridge. While it's an overnight thing (11 p.m. to 5 a.m. tonight), it means there's active work in the area, so keep an eye out for equipment or temporary barriers if you're an early bird or a night owl.

<AlertBox type="info">
**JOST Construction Alert:** Overnight closures on Walnut Avenue near the Jeffrey Open Space Trail bridge continue. Be mindful of potential construction activity or detours if you're out late or early.
</AlertBox>

Finally, with the unseasonably warm weather, remember your basics. Hydrate, wear light layers, and if you're prone to overheating, plan your longer efforts for earlier in the morning or later in the evening. There's "nice weather" and then there's "too nice, I forgot it's February and now I'm cooked" weather. Don't be the latter.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Don't Get Cooked:** With temperatures well above average, especially heading into Friday, remember to hydrate consistently. Wear appropriate clothing and consider adjusting your workout times to avoid the warmest parts of the day.
