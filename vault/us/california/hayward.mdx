Alright, Hayward, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the dirt today. Frankly, it's a mixed bag, so don't just blindly lace up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **AQI is not your friend today.** We're looking at a moderate Air Quality Index of 78, and the dominant pollutant is ozone. That stuff is rough on your lungs during heavy exertion.
*   **Weather's otherwise pretty sweet.** Clear skies and 17.1°C (around 63°F) means you won't be roasting or freezing. Just about perfect, if it weren't for the air quality.
*   **Localized Cleanup Event.** If your route takes you near Longwood Elementary, be aware of a "Keep Hayward Clean and Green Cleanup" happening from 8 AM to noon. Expect some volunteers and minor sidewalk/curb obstructions in that neighborhood.

Look, I get it. You've got your training plan, and 17 degrees feels amazing after some of the gray days we've had. But you can't ignore what you can't see, and today, that's ozone messing with your respiratory system. An AQI of 78 with ozone as the primary culprit means your lungs are working harder to get oxygen, and you're inhaling more irritants with every breath. If you're planning a hard effort, like pushing up the hills around Carlos Bee Park, you might want to dial it back, or even consider an indoor alternative if you're particularly sensitive.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Ozone Alert for Runners

The moderate AQI of 78, driven by ozone, is a real concern for anyone doing prolonged or heavy exercise today. Ozone can decrease lung function, inflame your airways, and make you feel short of breath, even if you don't typically have respiratory issues. Listen to your body and adjust your workout intensity. If you start feeling any discomfort, cut it short.

On the bright side, pollen is playing nice, so if allergies usually sideline you, you're in the clear there.

### Longwood Ave Cleanup Details

For those running or walking near Longwood Elementary School (850 Longwood Ave), the "Keep Hayward Clean and Green Cleanup" is active until noon. You might encounter volunteers, litter bags, and minor sidewalk blockages. Plan for slight detours or extra awareness if you're in that specific Longwood neighborhood.
</AlertBox>

No major trail closures or large-scale construction projects were reported in Hayward itself that would significantly impact your run today. There are always ongoing projects, like the Second Street Sidewalk Improvement Project which has a public meeting today but construction doesn't start until April, so you won't encounter that on your route yet. Just the usual city hustle.

So, go ahead, but keep that moderate AQI in mind. Don't be a hero; save those lungs for tomorrow.
