It's a pretty decent day to get outside for a workout in Long Beach, but keep your eyes peeled for more than just rogue skateboards.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Enjoy the clear skies and comfortable temps, but if your lungs are finicky, take it easy. The air quality isn't perfect for everyone.
*   Keep an eye out for construction-related traffic shifts around the ports.
*   Seriously, watch your back (and your bike) on our city's roads. Pedestrian and cyclist safety remains a significant concern.
</BulletList>

Today's a mixed bag, folks. The weather is playing nice – a glorious 18.7°C (around 66°F) and clear skies. Perfect for hitting the pavement or the beach path without baking or freezing. No surprise deluges, no howling winds to knock you off your feet. You'd think this would be a slam dunk for an outdoor session, but Long Beach always has a way of keeping you on your toes.

### Air Quality Check

While the sun is out, the air itself isn't pristine. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 74, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. What does that mean for your lungs? If you're generally healthy, you might not notice much. However, if you've got asthma, COPD, or other respiratory sensitivities, AccuWeather is calling the air quality "Poor" for sensitive groups today and suggesting you reduce your time outside. Don't be a hero; listen to your body.

### Local Hazards on the Horizon (and already here)

Here's where things get interesting. While there aren't any current wildfires or flash floods, Long Beach is a city that's always under construction, and some of it impacts your routes more than you think.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Vincent Thomas Bridge Lane Closures:** The big Vincent Thomas Bridge redecking project is kicking off in early 2026. That means one-directional lane closures for the next nine months. If your route takes you anywhere near the Port of Los Angeles entrance, anticipate heavier traffic and potential detours. Plan accordingly, especially if you're biking or running on adjacent streets.
</AlertBox>

And speaking of planning, let's talk about the **2nd Street Bridge**. While the *major* reconstruction to replace the upper deck and upgrade sidewalks and bike lanes isn't slated until Fall 2026, the discussions around it highlight a persistent problem: pedestrian and cyclist safety. Our roads, especially busy corridors, have a history of pedestrian-involved crashes. Back in 2025, from July 2024 to July 2025, there were 215 pedestrian-involved crashes with 13 fatalities across the city, with areas like PCH, Pacific, 7th Street, Long Beach Boulevard, and East Anaheim being particularly dangerous.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Pedestrian & Cyclist Safety Alert:** Even on seemingly calm days, remain vigilant. The 2nd Street Bridge is a good example of existing infrastructure that needs safety upgrades. Assume drivers don't see you, obey all traffic laws, and make yourself as visible as possible. No PR is worth risking your life over.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type(s) |
| :----------- | :--------------- |
| Low          | N/A              |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are low. So, at least your sinuses won't be joining your lungs in a protest today.

Overall, it's a solid day for movement, but you've got to be smart about *where* and *how* you're moving. Enjoy the sunshine, but don't check your brain at the door.
