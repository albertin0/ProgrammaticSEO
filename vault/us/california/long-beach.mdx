If you're looking to crush a personal best on the beach path today, you might want to reconsider and stick to the treadmill; the air is pretty crummy.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is the Real Killer:** Forget clear skies, Long Beach is dealing with some lingering crud in the air from fires east of us, making outdoor exertion a bad idea, especially if your lungs aren't 100%.
*   **Pollen's Taking a Chill Pill:** Good news for allergy sufferers, tree and grass pollen are practically non-existent right now.
*   **Construction Ahead:** Regulars heading towards the port, be aware that the Vincent Thomas Bridge is gearing up for some serious work, and the Shoemaker Bridge ramps are also on the chopping block later this year.

## The Air: Don't Breathe Too Deep

Look, I know it looks pretty out there – clear skies, mild 18.4°C (that's a comfortable 65°F for the Fahrenheit crowd). Perfect for a run along the Shoreline Aquatic Park, right? Wrong. The City Health Officer is explicitly warning about "unhealthy air quality until further notice" thanks to some fires kicking up smoke near Irvine and Fullerton. This isn't just a suggestion; it's a "don't be an idiot" notice.

Your phone app might tell you the AQI is only 82, which sounds borderline moderate, but the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), and local air quality reports are classifying today's air as "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups" due to PM2.5 and PM10. When the city tells you to avoid "vigorous outdoor or indoor exertion," they mean it. Save your lungs, seriously.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**DANGER: Poor Air Quality Due to Smoke!**
The Long Beach Health Officer has issued a warning for unhealthy air quality. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity, especially if you have respiratory or heart conditions. Keep windows closed and run your AC with a good filter.

### What's Up with Pollen?

If your only complaint usually involves seasonal sneezes, you're in luck. The pollen count is low across the board.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Trees       | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Weeds       | Low   |

### Construction and Commutes

While not directly impacting your run *on* the beach path, if you're driving to your workout spot, be mindful. The Vincent Thomas Bridge is kicking off its massive redecking project "early 2026," meaning single-direction lane closures are already happening for the next nine months. If you usually navigate that way, plan alternative routes to avoid delays and added frustration. Also, word is the Shoemaker Bridge ramps over the 710 are slated for demolition later this year, which will definitely throw a wrench into some traffic patterns.

**Tip for the Day:**
Today's a solid day for indoor workouts. Hit the gym, do some bodyweight stuff at home, or finally tackle that yoga video you've been putting off. Give your lungs a break from the particulates floating around.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up for Drivers:**
Construction on the Vincent Thomas Bridge is already causing one-directional lane closures. This could impact your commute to or from parts of Long Beach, especially if you're coming from the San Pedro area.
