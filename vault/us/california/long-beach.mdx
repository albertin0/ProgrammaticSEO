Alright, Long Beach, you want to know if it's a good day to get out there? It's not bad, but don't go thinking it's perfect.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Temperatures are mild, hovering around 16°C and clear skies mean you won't be melting or soaked.
*   Pollen levels are practically non-existent, so your allergies can take a backseat today.
*   Air quality is sitting at a "Moderate" 65 AQI, primarily due to ozone, so if you're sensitive, don't push it too hard.
</BulletList>

Today's not a bad day to hit the pavement or the sand, but let's be realistic – it's still Long Beach. That "Clear" sky forecast means the sun is out, and with low humidity, it can feel warmer than the thermometer suggests. If you're planning a long run down the **Long Beach Bike Path** from Shoreline Village to Belmont Shore, enjoy the ocean breeze, but keep an eye on that UV index.

## What to Watch Out For

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Air Quality (Ozone)
The AQI is currently 65, which is considered moderate. This means that unusually sensitive people, like those with asthma or respiratory issues, should probably dial back any prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. You won't see it, but that ozone can tickle your lungs. Listen to your body, not just your playlist.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### City Construction is Still a Thing
Long Beach is always under construction, and 2026 is no different. Expect ongoing road work and potential detours on major corridors. The Studebaker Road Transformation Project, for example, is still rebuilding that lengthy north-south stretch, and downtown is seeing the massive Mosaic redevelopment at the old City Place site. If your route takes you near these areas, be mindful of traffic, dust, and unexpected changes to your usual path. This isn't a direct "hazard" for your run, but it's a constant reality in this city.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Mountain Trails Are Closed
For those of you who like to escape the city and hit the higher elevations, be aware that several trails in the Angeles National Forest, including those around Mount Baldy, are currently closed through today, February 26th. This is due to winter conditions and public safety concerns. So, if you had a mountain run planned, pivot to something closer to sea level.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |

| Overall     | Low   |

Overall, it's a solid day for outdoor activity if you're not in the "unusually sensitive" category for air quality. Hydrate, be aware of your surroundings, especially near construction zones, and get those miles in.
