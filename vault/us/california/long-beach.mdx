It's a pretty decent day to get your miles in, but don't slack on checking that air quality.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The weather is absolutely prime for hitting the pavement or trails, with clear skies and a comfortable 19.4°C (67°F). No excuses there.</li>
  <li>Pollen is at a blissfully low level, so your sniffles won't be joining you for your workout.</li>
  <li>However, our air quality is sitting in the "Moderate" zone with a dominant pollutant of inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), so those with sensitive lungs should still exercise caution.</li>
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. We live in Long Beach, and perfect running weather is a gift we often take for granted. Today's 19.4°C (67°F) with clear skies is basically begging you to get outside. The lack of rain is a definite plus, unlike some of those soggy days we've seen recently. And for those of us who turn into a walking allergy attack this time of year, "Low" pollen is music to our congested ears.

But before you sprint out the door, let's talk about the invisible stuff. Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is currently at 68, which is "Moderate." The dominant pollutant, inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), isn't ideal for anyone, especially if you're pushing your cardiovascular system. Some sources are even calling the air quality "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups" today.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **AQI Advisory for Sensitive Individuals:** While the AQI is "Moderate," if you have asthma, other respiratory issues, or are just feeling a bit off, consider dialing back the intensity or shortening your outdoor session. Pay attention to your body – coughing or throat irritation means it's time to head inside.
</AlertBox>

Now, for your route planning. If you're typically cruising along the **Shoreline Aquatic Park** or other popular spots near the water, you're mostly in the clear from recent major *event-related* closures. However, there's always something under construction in this city, isn't there?

The "Long Beach Consolidation Project," aimed at improving water quality in the Western Bays, has ongoing construction. This means temporary closures and work happening generally Monday through Saturday, from 7 AM to 7 PM, affecting areas like Harbor Road, First Avenue, and West Park. If your run takes you through these neighborhoods, be aware of potential detours and construction noise.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Heads Up on Construction Zones:** Keep an eye out for active construction around Harbor Road, First Avenue, and West Park, especially if you're an early bird or evening runner. Stick to marked detours, watch for heavy equipment, and assume drivers aren't looking out for you.

Overall, today's a solid win for getting your sweat on, just be smart about that air. Lace up, look around, and maybe don't go for a new PR if your lungs feel even a little grumpy.
