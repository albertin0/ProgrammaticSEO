Alright, Huntington Beach, listen up. Today's one of those days where you really gotta pick your battles if you're heading outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Marathon Mayhem:** If you weren't signed up, you're probably out of luck. The **SOCAL River Marathon** is taking over the Santa Ana River Trail today, from Yorba Linda all the way down to Huntington Beach State Park. Expect crowds, closures, and limited access along that entire stretch for most of the morning and early afternoon.</li>
  <li>**"Moderate" Air Quality (for some):** While the air might look clear and feel fine for many, the AQI is sitting at 61 with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. AccuWeather's even calling it "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups." If you've got lung issues, asthma, or you're just generally sensitive to bad air, think twice about pushing it.</li>
  <li>**Perfect Running Weather (if you can find a clear path):** Seriously, 16.6°C (about 62°F) and clear skies? That's prime SoCal running weather. Just don't let the nice temps trick you into forgetting the other stuff.</li>
</BulletList>

## The Full Breakdown

Let's talk about that marathon. You've got full, half, 10K, and 5K races all kicking off at various times from 8:00 AM, with people funneling into Huntington Beach State Park. If your usual long run route involves the Santa Ana River Trail or the path near the beach, you're going to be dodging runners, cones, and possibly some bewildered tourists. It's a huge event, so unless you have a bib pinned to your chest, consider an alternative route or a later start.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  <h3>SOCAL River Marathon Trail Congestion</h3>
  Today, February 28, 2026, the Santa Ana River Trail and areas leading to Huntington Beach State Park will be heavily impacted by the SOCAL River Marathon. If you're not participating, plan on significant detours and crowds. Give the racers their space and avoid the area during active race hours (roughly 8 AM - 2 PM).

Air quality is a bit of a mixed bag. Our internal data says AQI 61, "Moderate," with PM10 being the main culprit. But some sources are leaning more towards "Poor" and advising sensitive groups to reduce outdoor exertion. Look, if you're not feeling 100%, or you're usually bothered by dust or particulates, maybe keep that long, hard interval session indoors today. Don't be a hero. Your lungs will thank you.

<AlertBox type="info">
  <h3>Know Your Air Quality Limits</h3>
  While generally moderate, an AQI of 61 with PM10 as the dominant pollutant means sensitive individuals (kids, older adults, those with respiratory issues) should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor activity. Pay attention to how you feel.

### Pollen Report:
| Pollen Type | Level |
|---|---|
| Overall   | Low |

Good news for the allergy sufferers: pollen is low today. So, no sneezing through your sprints, at least not because of the local flora.

Now, for those thinking of hitting the actual beach or getting in the water:

<AlertBox type="danger">
  <h3>Ongoing Talbert Channel Maintenance & Perennial Stingray Threat</h3>
  OC Public Works has ongoing sand removal at the Talbert Channel Ocean Outlet, which means heavy equipment in that area. More importantly, don't forget the **stingrays**. While the last major warning was in January, stingray activity is always a concern in shallow Huntington Beach waters. Do the "stingray shuffle" and if you get stung, find a lifeguard and get that appendage into hot water ASAP.
</AlertBox>

In short: it's a beautiful day, but it's *busy*. If you're running the marathon, good luck, don't trip. If you're not, find a different stretch of pavement or hit the gym. Or, you know, do some burpees in your living room. I won't tell.
