Alright, let's cut to the chase. Is today a good day to push it? Not bad, but don't go thinking it's pristine.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hitting that "moderate" zone, and it's those sneaky tiny particles that are the main culprit. Your lungs will know it.
*   Weather's pretty perfect, which means you'll probably get more foot traffic than usual on the good trails.
*   Some of our coastal trails are still fighting the good fight against erosion, so watch your step if you're hitting the bluffs.

### Air Quality Report: Don't Breathe Too Deep

Look, the AQI is sitting at 56 today. That's "moderate," technically, but it's not exactly sparkling clean. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, the stuff less than 10 micrometers in diameter. Think of it as microscopic grit floating around, ready to irritate your airways. If you're one of those "unusually sensitive" types, or if you've got existing lung issues, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to indoors. Otherwise, you might find yourself doing more wheezing than working out.

### The Great Outdoors: Mostly Good, But Check Your Footing

The temperature is a balmy 18.4°C (that's about 65°F for those of us who still think in Fahrenheit), and it's clear skies. Ideal running weather, no doubt. But here's the kicker: with clear skies often comes more people, especially around our prime spots like the Huntington Beach Bike Trail.

Speaking of trails, the Bluff Top Trail is still a bit of a battleground against coastal erosion. We're talking ongoing safety hazards where the bluff has retreated. While the big "stabilization project" isn't slated for construction until 2027, and design until late 2026, the current state of affairs means you need to pay attention. Don't go assuming every inch of that path is solid.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Coastal Erosion on Bluff Top Trail:** The Bluff Top Trail, a crucial section of the Huntington Beach Bike Trail, is experiencing ongoing coastal erosion, creating safety hazards. Stick to marked paths and keep an eye out for unstable areas.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Nearby Trail Closures:** If you're venturing out to some of the wider Orange County parks, be aware that many trails in regional spots like Clark, Caspers Wilderness, and Santiago Oaks Regional Parks are currently closed due to wet and muddy conditions from recent rain. The Santa Ana River Trail also has maintenance going on between Weir Canyon Road/La Palma Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. Double-check before you drive all the way out there.

**DUI Checkpoint Tonight:** Heads up for anyone driving to or from their workout. The HBPD has a DUI & License Checkpoint scheduled for tonight, February 26, 2026. Plan accordingly and stay safe on the roads.

### Pollen Report: The Usual Suspects are Chill

Good news for your sinuses, the pollen situation is "Low" today. My own sources confirm "none" for common offenders like Pine and Oak. So at least your sniffling won't be pollen-related.

| Pollen Type | Level (Today) |
| :---------- | :------------ |
| Overall     | Low           |
| Pine        | None          |
| Oak         | None          |
| Grass       | None          |
| Weed        | None          |
