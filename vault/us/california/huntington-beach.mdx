Alright, Huntington Beach. Today's a decent day to get out there, but keep that ozone in mind.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is hovering in that "moderate" zone, primarily due to ozone. Your lungs might notice it more than usual, especially if you're pushing hard or sensitive to air pollutants.</li>
  <li>Temperatures are sitting pretty in the mid-teens (that's 14.8°C for those of us who prefer actual metrics), and it's clear out. Perfect running weather, no complaints there.</li>
  <li>Pollen is blessedly low, so your sinuses can probably take a break.</li>
</BulletList>

Look, the weather's cooperating, which is more than we can say for some days here in Surf City. At 14.8°C and clear skies, your body's going to be happy moving. Grab that lighter jacket, or just a long sleeve, and get going.

However, let's talk about the air. Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a 68, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Now, for most of us hard-headed runners, that's still in the "acceptable" range. But if you've got asthma, any other respiratory issues, or just notice you're huffing and puffing a bit more than usual, listen to your body. Today isn't the day to try for a PR on the Huntington Beach Bicycle Trail if that ozone is making you feel it. Save the blistering pace for a "Good" AQI day.

### Local Hazards & Tips

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Ozone Alert:** With an AQI of 68 and ozone as the main culprit, sensitive individuals might experience respiratory irritation. Consider scaling back your intensity, especially if you're new to the area or have pre-existing lung conditions. Keep an eye on how you feel.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **The Stingray Shuffle is Year-Round:** While no *new* stingray warnings were issued in the last 24 hours, this is Huntington Beach, people. If you're planning on dipping your toes in the Pacific after your run, remember to do the "stingray shuffle" in shallow water. You don't want to start your day with a surprise sting.
</AlertBox>

No crazy winds to fight against today, which is a bonus for those long stretches along the coast. And thankfully, no reports of wildfires or significant trail closures popping up in the last 24 hours to derail your route around Central Park. So, the paths are open, the air's mostly tolerable, and the weather's on your side for a solid workout. Just be smart about that ozone.
