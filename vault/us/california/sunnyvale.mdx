Alright, Sunnyvale, let's talk about today. It's one of those days where the weather *looks* fantastic, but if you don't check a few things, you might be breathing in more than just fresh air or running into a literal roadblock.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Don't let the sunshine fool you:** That clear sky is hiding an Air Quality Index of 78, with nitrogen dioxide as the star pollutant. That's moderate, folks, which means if your lungs are easily annoyed, or you're planning on crushing some serious intervals, maybe dial it back or stick indoors.
*   **Sanborn County Park is a no-go for large parts:** Planning a hike up in Sanborn? Forget it. Large sections, including the Costanoan parking lot and picnic area, are shut down through the end of March for construction. Oh, and Summit Rock? Closed for falcon nesting season. So much for escaping the city grind up there.
*   **Pollen's playing nice:** At least one thing is in our favor today – pollen levels are low. So if seasonal allergies usually turn your outdoor workouts into a snot-filled nightmare, you get a reprieve.
</BulletList>

The mercury is sitting pretty at 16.9°C (that's about 62.4°F for the Fahrenheit crowd), and it's clear. Looks can be deceiving, though. That moderate AQI is enough to make you reconsider your long run, especially if you're sensitive. Nitrogen dioxide is no joke for your respiratory system.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### AQI is Moderate – Mind Your Lungs!
With an AQI of 78 and nitrogen dioxide as the dominant pollutant, it’s not the worst, but it’s definitely not "pristine." If you have asthma, other respiratory conditions, or just sensitive lungs, consider keeping your workout less intense or opting for indoor exercise today. Otherwise, stick to less trafficked areas if you can, to avoid more vehicle emissions.
</AlertBox>

If you were eyeing a proper trail escape, skip **Sanborn County Park**. It's got major sections, including the Costanoan parking lot and picnic area, completely closed off for construction until the end of March 2026. Plus, Summit Rock is off-limits for peregrine falcon nesting season. Your tax dollars at work, I suppose, but it means fewer options for you.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Sanborn County Park: Major Closures Ahead!
Don't waste your gas driving up to Sanborn County Park today expecting a full trail run. The Costanoan parking lot, picnic area, and other sections are closed through March due to significant trail construction. Summit Rock is also closed for falcon nesting. Find another spot to get your nature fix.
</AlertBox>

Around town, Sunnyvale's always got something being torn down or built up. There's a new project slated to bring 370 new homes, replacing older tech buildings on Dein Drive, which means general construction activity is a constant hum. It won't necessarily block your run down the **Baylands Trail**, but expect local traffic shifts and maybe some extra noise if you're hitting the streets.

Speaking of trails, the Guadalupe River Trail's east side closure wrapped up yesterday, February 27th, and the west side closure doesn't kick off until March 2nd. So, you've got a window there this weekend if you're hitting that specific spot, though keep an eye out next week.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Plan Ahead for Next Week's Guadalupe River Trail Closure
While the Guadalupe River Trail's east side has reopened as of today, February 28th, remember that the west levee/maintenance road section south of Tasman Drive will be closed weekdays from Monday, March 2nd, through Friday, March 20th, from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Get your weekend miles in now.

So, if you're desperate for an outdoor workout, today's not terrible, but it's not ideal. Stick to low-impact, maybe avoid high-traffic areas, and definitely steer clear of Sanborn unless you just want to look at the closed signs.
