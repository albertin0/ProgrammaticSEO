Alright, San Diego, if you're thinking of hitting the trails today, you're looking at a classic San Diego situation: picture-perfect weather, but don't let those pretty skies fool you about the air.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Enjoy the heck out of those clear, mild conditions. At a pleasant 15.8°C (that’s about 60°F for the Fahrenheit die-hards), it’s pretty much ideal for getting outside.
*   Your sniffle-free run is practically guaranteed with pollen levels sitting at a glorious "Low." No excuses on that front.
*   However, that "Moderate" AQI of 76, with ozone playing the starring role, means your lungs might not be as thrilled as the rest of you, especially if you plan on actually breaking a sweat.
</BulletList>

Look, the weather gods are being kind today, but it's San Diego, so there's always a catch, isn't there? That Moderate Air Quality Index, driven by ground-level ozone, is that persistent little cloud hanging over our otherwise sunny disposition. We’ve been ranked high up there for smog, and while today isn't a "red alert" day, an AQI of 76 is still enough to notice, particularly if you’re prone to respiratory issues or you’re pushing your pace. Think of it as a low-grade sunburn for your lungs if you overdo it.

### Current Hazards & Annoyances

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert: Pace Yourself.** While it’s tempting to smash your personal best with these cool, clear skies, remember that ozone hangs around and can irritate your airways. If you feel any chest tightness, coughing, or unusual shortness of breath, back off. There's always tomorrow, assuming the air cooperates. San Diego has a history with ozone pollution, and while the provided data is "moderate" today, it's a known issue.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Torrey Pines Trail Closures are STILL ON.** For those of you planning on a scenic run through Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve, you’re mostly out of luck. Most of the main reserve trails, the park road, and upper parking lots are closed through February for "improvements." Seems like a pretty long project, eh? You can still hit the South and North Beach parking lots, and Torrey Pines State Beach is open if you want a sand slog instead. Full access is *expected* by March 1st, so hold tight, or find an alternate route.
</AlertBox>

As for other issues, construction is always a thing in this city, but nothing new popped up in the last 24 hours that should throw a wrench in your specific workout plans, beyond the usual city-life detours. No surprise wildfires, no crazy winds ripping through Mission Valley, and no flash floods turning the San Diego River into a white-water rapids course. Just good ol' mild weather and a touch of lung-tickling ozone.

### Today's Pollen Breakdown (Because someone always asks)

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Tree        | Low     |
| Grass       | Low     |
| Weed        | Low     |

So, go run, walk, bike, or whatever your chosen form of self-inflicted torture is. Just keep an eye on how those lungs are feeling, especially if you're hitting it hard around areas with more traffic or less tree cover. Don't be a hero; nobody wants to swap a runner's high for an emergency room visit.

*Data grounded with various local news sources and environmental reports from February 25-26, 2026.*
