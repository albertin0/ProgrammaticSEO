Alright, San Diegans, it's shaping up to be a pretty decent day to get outside, but as always, there are a few local quirks to watch out for.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Clear skies and low pollen levels** are a breath of fresh air (literally!), meaning less sneezes and clearer visibility on your run.
*   **Moderate air quality** due to inhalable particulate matter could still be an irritant for sensitive lungs, especially if you're pushing the pace.
*   **Major trail closures** at iconic spots like Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve mean you'll need a Plan B for your scenic ocean-view routes.

### Weather & Air Quality Rundown

Today, February 28, 2026, San Diego is looking at a clear day with a comfortable 18.7°C (that's about 65.7°F for those of you still clinging to Fahrenheit). Low pollen levels across the board are a win, so your seasonal allergies shouldn't be making an appearance to ruin your PR attempt.

However, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 64, which is "Moderate." The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) [cite: Environmental Data]. While not terrible, it's not ideal either. For most, a moderate AQI means you're probably fine, but if you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, you might feel a bit of irritation, especially during high-intensity efforts. Don't be a hero; listen to your body.

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant | Temperature (°C) | Condition |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- | :--------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 64  | PM10               | 18.7             | Clear     |

<AlertBox type="info">
**Tip:** If you're heading out for a longer run or bike ride, consider easing up on the intensity today, especially if you're prone to respiratory sensitivities. It's not the day to decide you're suddenly going for a new VO2 max record.

### Local Hazards & Annoyances

#### Construction Chaos

Caltrans is busy as usual, meaning some road closures that could impact your drive to a trailhead or your route if you're running on the streets. Specifically, the northbound SR-163 on-ramps from 11th Avenue and A Street are closed from 3 AM to 7 AM today for guardrail repair. Also, the eastbound SR-52 connector to southbound I-15 is shut down from 5 AM to 11 AM for roadwork. These are mainly traffic headaches, but if you're an urban runner, be aware of potential detours and increased vehicle noise.

More notably for runners and cyclists, if you're near UCSD or La Jolla, expect some nighttime construction noise and lighting around southbound I-5 at Gilman Drive. Three of four lanes are closed from 7 PM to 11 AM today for bridge work, though all lanes are open during the day. Just be mindful if you're out early or late.

#### Trail Trouble: Torrey Pines is a No-Go (Mostly)

This is the big one for our scenic trail runners. Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve is still under partial closure until March 1, 2026, for upgrades. That means the main park road, the upper parking lots, and **all trails within the main reserve are closed to cars and pedestrians**. Don't even try to sneak in; they're serious. Your best bet if you want to be near the bluffs is to stick to the South Beach and North Beach parking lots and Torrey Pines State Beach itself. So, forget that epic climb to Razor Point for now.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Danger Zone: Torrey Pines Trails Are CLOSED.** Seriously, don't ignore the signs. Find another route for your trail fix until March 1.

#### Tijuana River Valley Air Quality

While the general AQI is moderate, there's a persistent localized issue in the Tijuana River Valley with elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), that lovely rotten egg smell, due to cross-border pollution. An advisory from January 15, 2026, recommended limiting outdoor time in that specific area if you're sensitive or experiencing symptoms. While not a county-wide alert today, if you live or plan to work out near the Tijuana River Valley, be aware that this is an ongoing problem and could impact your outdoor activity.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Localized Concern: Tijuana River Valley.** If you're in the South Bay near the Tijuana River Valley, be aware of potential elevated hydrogen sulfide levels. If you smell rotten eggs, it's not just a bad breakfast; limit your outdoor exposure.
</AlertBox>

No significant wildfire activity or extreme weather warnings for flooding or high winds have been reported in the last 24 hours that would broadly impact outdoor workouts. So, as long as you steer clear of closed trails and construction zones, and maybe avoid the stink in the South Bay, you're good to go.
