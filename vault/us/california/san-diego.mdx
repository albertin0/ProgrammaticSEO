Today's weather might look deceivingly good, but don't get too comfortable, San Diego.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **That AQI is a bummer:** While the sun's out, we're sitting at a "Moderate" 77 AQI, with inhalable particulate matter leading the charge. Your lungs are going to feel that if you push too hard.
*   **Heating Up Fast:** We're clear and a comfortable 20.6°C (69°F) right now, but a high-pressure system is turning up the dial. Tomorrow and through the weekend, we're looking at temperatures potentially hitting the low 90s inland. Don't let today's mildness make you forget to hydrate.
*   **Still Some Trail Snafus:** Remember those "winter storms" from last week? While the rain is long gone, the aftermath means some of our beloved trails, especially in higher elevations like Cleveland National Forest, might still be dealing with minor damage or soft ground. Even worse, don't even *think* about hitting most of the trails at Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve – they're closed for upgrades through the end of February.
</BulletList>

Look, I love a good clear sky as much as the next runner, but an AQI of 77 with PM10 as the dominant pollutant? That's not exactly prime breathing air, especially for your longer efforts or if you're prone to respiratory irritation. It's not "stay indoors and panic" bad, but it's definitely "consider taking it easy" bad. Don't go trying to set any PRs on your Mission Trails loops today.

Speaking of trails, if you had your heart set on the breathtaking views at Torrey Pines, you're out of luck. Most of those trails are shut down until March for a big improvement project. So, for now, find another scenic route, or you'll just be staring at a "Trail Closed" sign – probably with a bewildered look on your face because you didn't read this guide. Don't say I didn't warn you.

And let's talk about this "clear" weather. It's nice, sure. But it's the calm before the heat storm. Starting tomorrow, we're entering an "abnormally warm" period, with some inland valleys possibly hitting 90 degrees or more. Your body needs to adjust, so don't suddenly decide to double your mileage just because the sun feels good today.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Low          | N/A           |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI is Moderate:** With PM10 levels elevated, sensitive individuals (asthma, COPD, kids, older adults) should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. Even if you're not sensitive, consider scaling back the intensity of your workout. Your lungs will thank you.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Torrey Pines Trails are CLOSED!** Seriously, don't waste your gas driving out there. Most trails at Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve are undergoing improvement projects and won't be fully accessible until March 1st. Find an alternate route or risk a very frustrating dead end.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration is Key (Even Today):** Temperatures are on the rise for the next few days. Even with today's pleasant 20.6°C, start preemptively hydrating for the hotter days ahead. Carry extra water, especially if you're heading out to those exposed canyons.
