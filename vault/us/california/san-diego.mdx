Alright San Diego, today’s looking like a mixed bag for hitting the pavement or trails. The weather is playing nice, but don't let that fool you into thinking everything's smooth sailing.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "Clear" sky feels great, but the air still isn't perfect, hovering in the moderate zone.
*   Recent storms mean some trails are probably still a muddy, slippery mess, especially if they haven't seen much sun.
*   Oh, and if Torrey Pines is your jam, you're out of luck. Again.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe

Let's talk about the air. Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a moderate 77 today, with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) being the main culprit. That's fine for most, but if your lungs are particularly sensitive, or if you're planning a really intense workout, you might feel it. It's not "stay indoors and panic" bad, but it's not "breathe deep and feel invigorated" good either.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate AQI: PM10 is in the Air
With an AQI of 77 and PM10 as the dominant pollutant, those with respiratory sensitivities might experience some discomfort during prolonged outdoor exertion. Consider sticking to routes away from busy roads where particulate matter tends to concentrate.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| General     | Low     |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are mercifully low. No excuses for watery eyes or sneezing fits ruining your run on that front.

## Trail Trouble: Torrey Pines Still a No-Go

Now for the real kick in the teeth. If you're planning to enjoy the stunning vistas or challenging climbs at Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve, you'll need to pivot. The park road, upper parking lots, and *all trails within the main reserve are completely closed* due to a construction project. This isn't a new thing, folks, it's been going on since November and is expected to last until *March 1st*. Yeah, tomorrow. So today, it's still closed. The South Beach and North Beach parking lots, and Torrey Pines State Beach itself, are technically open, but for actual trail running, you're out of luck. Find another hill to conquer.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Torrey Pines Main Trails CLOSED!
Just a reminder, folks: the main trails at Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve are still fully shut down for construction until tomorrow, March 1st. Don't waste your gas driving up there expecting a run.

## Post-Storm Shenanigans

We just had a "final storm system" pass through yesterday (Thursday, Feb 26), bringing gusty winds, rain, and snow to the mountains, and some localized flooding concerns in parts of the county due to over 5 inches of rain in the last 72 hours. While the immediate San Diego coastal areas mostly saw "clear" conditions today, that doesn't mean inland trails or canyon paths aren't still waterlogged and slippery.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Watch Your Step on Trails
Even though the skies are clear, recent heavy rainfall means many trails, especially those with unpaved surfaces, could be muddy, unstable, and extremely slippery. If you’re heading out, wear appropriate footwear and be extra cautious to avoid twisted ankles or surprise tumbles.
</AlertBox>

## Rail Road Ahead?

A quick note if your usual route takes you near the tracks: the North County Transit District (NCTD) had a coastal rail service shutdown just a few days ago (Feb 21-22) for maintenance. Even though the trains are running again, they're still urging folks to be cautious near rail lines and be aware of construction vehicles and crews. Always use designated crossings. No shortcuts over the tracks, you hear?
