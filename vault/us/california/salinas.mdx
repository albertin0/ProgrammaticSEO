Alright, Salinas, if you're thinking about hitting the pavement or trails today, February 26, 2026, you'll need to exercise a healthy dose of caution, especially if you were out early.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Fogged Up Mornings:** The Salinas Valley was under a dense fog advisory until 11 AM today, which means visibility was absolute garbage. Even if it's cleared by now, those moist conditions can stick around, making some surfaces slick.
*   **Breather Beware:** Your Lungs might feel it a bit today. We're sitting at an AQI of 80, which is "Moderate," thanks to fine particulate matter. While it's not "unhealthy" for everyone, if you've got sensitive lungs, you might notice it during a strenuous workout.
*   **Construction Chaos:** Don't expect smooth sailing. There's ongoing construction downtown on West Alisal Street with sidewalk closures and pedestrian impacts, and Stage 2 of the Boronda Road Congestion Relief Project is still causing disruptions around McKinnon.

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

| Pollutant                | Level       | AQI  |
| :----------------------- | :---------- | :--- |
| **Fine particulate matter** | Moderate    | 80   |
| **Pollen**               | Low         | N/A  |

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch Your Step (and Your Breath)

Even though the sun might be peeking out now, that early morning fog probably left some moisture. Be aware of potentially slick spots on sidewalks or unpaved trails. Also, while the AQI isn't terrible, 80 with fine particulate matter means anyone with asthma or other respiratory issues should probably dial back the intensity. Listen to your body – it's not lying to you.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, if you were out running along West Alisal Street this morning, dodging both the pea-souper fog and sidewalk construction, you earned extra credit for hazard navigation. These ongoing "improvements" might be good for the city long-term, but they're a royal pain for anyone trying to get a decent workout in the short term. Expect detours and uneven surfaces around these zones for the next few months.

### Hydrate, Even If It Doesn't Feel Hot

The temperature is a comfortable 21°C (70°F), which feels nice, but don't let that trick you into forgetting your water bottle. Even on mild days, especially if you're pushing yourself, dehydration creeps up faster than you think. Also, with potential lingering moisture from the fog, give those trail shoes a quick wipe down before you head back inside – no one wants to track mud through the house.
</AlertBox>

If your regular route takes you anywhere near Boronda Road, make sure you're checked for the latest closures. "Stage 2" implies there was a Stage 1, and these things rarely get simpler. Just because your running app tells you to go a certain way, doesn't mean the City of Salinas agrees with it right now. Don't be that person ignoring the cones.
