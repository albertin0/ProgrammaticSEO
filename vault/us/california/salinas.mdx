Alright, Salinas, if you're eyeing that morning run, today's a bit of a mixed bag; enjoy the weather, but maybe keep it mellow.

<BulletList>
*   That "moderate" air quality means your lungs might not love a hard effort, especially if you're susceptible to particulate matter.
*   Weather-wise, it's absolutely gorgeous out there, perfect for a comfortable outdoor session.
*   Construction around town, especially near Toro Park and downtown, means you'll need to be extra aware of your surroundings and potential detours.
</BulletList>

Let's be real, the best thing going for us today is this weather. At a crisp 16.8°C (around 62°F) and clear skies, it’s prime running temperature. Not too hot, not too cold. Your joints will thank you for that Goldilocks zone, making it a good day for those longer efforts or just enjoying a stroll without turning into a sweaty mess or an icicle. And hey, low pollen is always a win for anyone who usually spends spring sneezing their way through a workout.

Now, for the buzzkill: the air quality. We're sitting at an AQI of 81, which falls into the "moderate" category, with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) being the dominant pollutant. "Moderate" usually means it's generally okay for most folks, but if you've got asthma, emphysema, or are just a bit more sensitive, you might feel it. Don't go trying to set any PRs today that require you to inhale like a vacuum cleaner. It's not *horrible*, but it's certainly not pristine mountain air.

### Moderate Air Quality Alert
With an AQI of 81 and PM10 as the dominant pollutant, sensitive individuals should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Pay attention to how your body feels.

Beyond the air, let's talk about getting around. Our fair city is a perpetual construction zone these days. If you're planning on hitting the trails or sidewalks, especially around the Downtown Complete Streets project on West Alisal Street and its cross streets, expect the usual mix of blocked sidewalks and uneven surfaces. These crews are working on new sidewalks and ADA-compliant ramps, which is great for the future, but a pain for your run *today*. So keep your head up and watch your footing.

And if your go-to spot is Toro Park, know that even getting there might be a bit of a headache. The "Toro Park Cut Through Traffic Pilot Project" means there are weekday partial closures on westbound Portola Drive from 6 AM to 9 AM, continuing through June 2026. Westbound traffic is blocked at the driveway of Toro Elementary School. This isn't just a minor inconvenience; it's a full-on traffic rerouting, so plan your route accordingly or be ready for delays. If you're trying to get a morning run in at Toro, that's going to complicate things.

### Construction Zone Navigation Tips
If you're running near downtown or trying to access Toro Park, check for active construction closures and detours. Unsecured objects or uneven surfaces from construction can be tripping hazards. Stay alert and be prepared to alter your route.

So, overall, today's a decent day for an outdoor workout if you keep it moderate and are smart about where you go. Hydrate, stay aware of your surroundings, and maybe stick to a gentler pace to avoid sucking in too much of that PM10.
