Alright, Salinas, if you're looking for an excuse to skip your run, today isn't it, but don't ignore the ever-present construction chaos.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Moderate:** AQI at 56, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) as the dominant pollutant. For most of you, it's fine, but if your lungs are particularly finicky, take it easy on the sprints.
*   **Construction Continues to Be a Nightmare:** Lane closures on US-101 near Messick Road South and the ongoing Boronda Road Congestion Relief Project mean you'll be dodging cones and distracted drivers.
*   **Perfect Running Weather:** Seriously, 14.4°C (that's 58°F for you non-metric folks) and clear skies? This is what we train for. Plus, pollen is low.
</BulletList>

## Your Daily Grind in Salinas

Look, the weather is gorgeous. That 14.4°C is prime running temperature, and with clear skies, there’s no excuse to stay inside unless you’re legitimately asthmatic or allergic to daylight. The low pollen count means your nose probably won't decide to run its own marathon down your face today, which is a rare blessing in this valley.

### Air Quality: Moderate, But Watch Out

While the AQI of 56 is in the "moderate" zone, it's that "inhalable particulate matter" that gets me. It's not a full-blown smoke advisory, but if you're one of those sensitive types, maybe don't push for that new PR on your route through the city. A casual jog around Toro County Park or sticking to a less trafficked area might be a smarter play. You don't want to trade clear lungs for a pretty view.

### Construction: The Eternal Hazard

Ah, Salinas. Our beloved city is perpetually "under construction," which means your "easy" run often turns into an obstacle course. Right now, expect lane closures on US-101 between Messick Road South and San Miguel Canyon Road. That's right in the middle of potential running or cycling routes. Then there's the ongoing Boronda Road Congestion Relief Project, which has been messing with traffic and flow since February 13th. And don't forget the water main replacement on Lincoln Avenue between Avenue B and West Alisal Street. If you're running on any major road, assume there's a detour, a flagger, or some fresh asphalt waiting to trip you up.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads up on City Streets!** Between the US-101 lane closures and the major Boronda Road project, your usual routes might be a mess. Stay alert for sudden lane shifts, construction vehicles, and confused drivers. Cyclists, you need to be exceptionally visible and cautious.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro-Tip: Plan Your Route Ahead.** Don't just wing it today if your run takes you near major roads. Check local traffic apps before you head out, or better yet, opt for a dedicated trail like those in Toro County Park if you can.

Overall, it's a solid day to get outside and move your body. Just be smart about where you're putting your feet and how hard you're pushing those lungs, especially if you're sensitive to air quality.
