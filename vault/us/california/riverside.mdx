Alright, Riverside, you want to get out there today? Go for it, but keep your head on a swivel, especially near the river.

<LungsJointsScore score={8} />

<BulletList>
*   Your lungs are going to thank you: The air quality is *good* with an AQI of 50, and pollen counts are mercifully low. Breathe deep, folks.
*   The weather is playing nice with a clear sky and a comfortable 20.3°C (around 68-70°F) right now. Perfect for shaking off those cobwebs.
*   But here's the kicker: If your usual route takes you along the **Santa Ana River Trail**, prepare for detours. There's significant levee rehabilitation work happening, with detours in effect between Riverside Avenue/Main Street and Columbia Avenue until at least July. You'll see personnel directing traffic, so pay attention.
*   Major road construction continues on the SR-91 and I-215, meaning traffic headaches if you're driving to your workout spot, and potential noise or dust if you're running nearby.
*   For those looking to escape the city for some serious elevation, remember the Mount Baldy trails (Baldy Bowl, Devil's Backbone, Icehouse Canyon, etc.) are still under an extended closure until the end of today, February 26th. Don't get yourself fined trying to sneak onto closed trails.

## Workout Warnings & Tips

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Santa Ana River Trail Detours
Seriously, don't just blindly follow your usual path. The Riverside Levees Rehabilitation Project means parts of the Santa Ana River Trail have active detours. Expect signage, personnel directing you around construction equipment near Riverside Avenue, and plan for some extra mileage or alternative routes if you want to avoid the mess. This is ongoing until July, so get used to it.

### Freeway Construction Continues
The SR-91 pavement rehabilitation project, running from west of Van Buren Boulevard to east of Madison Street, is in full swing through summer 2027. And the I-215 isn't much better, with ongoing pavement repairs between San Jacinto River Bridge and Ramona Expressway, and active work from Martin Luther King Blvd to SR-60/91 until fall 2026. If your run takes you anywhere near these corridors, anticipate increased vehicle traffic, lane closures, and construction noise. Stay visible and stay alert.

### Mount Baldy Trails Closed Today
If you had grand plans to hit the high country, tough luck. The Angeles National Forest has extended closures on several Mount Baldy area trails for public safety until the end of today, February 26th. Check official Angeles National Forest alerts before heading out on any trails up there, or save that epic climb for another day.

Look, it's a solid day for getting some miles in or hitting a park, especially with the clear skies and good air. Just be smart about where you're going and what obstacles you might face. Don't be that runner who ignores the "Trail Closed" sign and ends up having to explain themselves to a construction crew. Or worse, to a park ranger up on Baldy.
