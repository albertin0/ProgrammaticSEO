It's a pretty decent day to get outside in Riverside, but don't wander onto the Santa Ana River Trail expecting a smooth ride.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is hovering in the moderate zone, thanks to some ozone kicking around. Not terrible, but you'll notice it if you're pushing hard.</li>
  <li>Pollen is low, so at least your sinuses get a break today.</li>
  <li>Watch out for those detours on the Santa Ana River Trail; construction on the levees means you might need an alternate route.</li>
</BulletList>

Look, I'm a runner, I get it. You want to hit the trails, soak up some of that clear Riverside weather. And at 18.4°C (a pleasant 65°F), it's not going to bake you or freeze your digits off. The big upside today? That "low" pollen count. My fellow allergy sufferers, rejoice – your nose won't be staging a full-on rebellion after a few miles.

But let's be real, it's not all sunshine and PRs. Our AQI is sitting at 59, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. That's moderate, folks. If you've got sensitive lungs, or you're planning an ultra-marathon right now, you might feel that in your chest. It's not "stay indoors and seal the windows" bad, but it's not "take a deep, cleansing breath" good either.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Santa Ana River Trail users, pay attention!** The Riverside County Flood Control & Water Conservation District is doing some major rehabilitation on the levees. This means there are detours in effect on sections of the Santa Ana River Trail. Currently, you'll find detours between Riverside Avenue/Main Street and Columbia Avenue, which are expected to last until July 2026. Later, from April to July 2026, more detours will pop up between the Market Street Bridge and CA Highway 60. They say the trail stays open, but expect signage and be cautious around active construction zones. Don't go blasting through, hoping they'll move a backhoe for your Strava segment.

On a broader note, our area is always flirting with fire season. The Riverside Fire Department is already getting on folks about "defensible space" inspections because our wildland-urban interface and those notorious Santa Ana winds put us at high risk. While there's no major blaze spewing smoke across the city right now, there was a "Dale Fire" reported in Riverside County just two days ago on February 24th. It's a constant reminder that conditions can change fast, and we should always be aware.

And for those of you driving to your favorite trailhead, keep an eye on the SR-91. There's a pavement rehabilitation project underway that started in February and will run through summer 2027. Expect lane and ramp closures, day and night. It's a pain for traffic, and if you're trying to hit Mount Rubidoux or Sycamore Canyon, factor that extra time into your warm-up.

Here's the lowdown on the sniffles:

| Pollen Type | Level |

  Hydrate, people. Even with moderate temps, ozone can be a bit dehydrating, and it’s always good practice in our dry climate. Electrolytes aren't just for marathon day; they're for Tuesday runs too.
</AlertBox>

All in all, today is a decent, but not perfect, day for an outdoor workout. Just be smart about your routes and listen to your body, especially if you're susceptible to air quality issues.
