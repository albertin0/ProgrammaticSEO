Alright, Riverside, let's talk about hitting the trails today.

Today is one of those days where the weather looks deceptively inviting, but your lungs might have a different opinion.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI reading of 62 with ozone as the dominant pollutant means your lungs are going to be working a bit harder than usual, especially if you're pushing it. Don't assume "clear skies" means "clean air."
*   At 26.2°C (that's pushing 80°F, for those of us who prefer freedom units), it's warm enough to sneak up on you, even with low humidity. Heat exhaustion is a real thing, even in February.
*   Pollen is low, which is a rare win, but don't let that distract you from the other airborne nasties, like the ever-present fine particulate matter from traffic and general Inland Empire dust.

## The Rundown: Your Body vs. Riverside Today

Look, if you're planning on a long run along the Santa Ana River Trail, you need to be smart. While we're not dealing with any active wildfires today, and there's no immediate flooding risk from recent storms, Riverside always has its own flavor of environmental fun.

That moderate AQI isn't going to kill you, but ozone can definitely irritate your respiratory system, particularly if you're predisposed to issues or just go too hard too fast. Think of it as a subtle weight vest on your lungs. You might not notice it until you're already gasping.

The temperature, while pleasant for lounging, is on the higher side for strenuous activity. Hydration, people. This isn't groundbreaking news, but I still see too many runners out there looking like they're auditioning for a raisin commercial.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert (Moderate):** Your lungs are working harder to process the air today. If you feel any chest tightness, unusual coughing, or shortness of breath, back off immediately. This isn't the day for setting PRs if you're sensitive to air quality.
</AlertBox>

### Hydration is King (and Queen, and the entire royal court)

Seriously, at 26.2°C, you'll be sweating more than you think. Don't wait until you're thirsty; that's too late. Aim to be sipping water or an electrolyte drink *before* you even step out the door. Keep it up throughout your activity. And no, that lukewarm bottle you left in your car doesn't count as proactive hydration.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip: Early Birds Get the Cooler Worm:** If you have the flexibility, get your workout in earlier in the day to beat the peak temperatures and often, the peak ozone levels. The air quality tends to degrade as the day goes on and traffic picks up.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Low pollen is a blessing, especially if you're usually an allergy sufferer. But don't swap your allergy meds for a false sense of security regarding the *rest* of the air quality. Riverside's air has a lot more going on than just pollen.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Sun Protection Isn't Optional:** Clear skies mean direct sun. Slather on that sunscreen, wear a hat, and consider sunglasses. Protecting your skin and eyes is part of overall workout safety.
</AlertBox>

So, can you work out today? Yeah, probably. But don't just blindly trust the clear skies. Listen to your body, hydrate like it's your job, and acknowledge that the air isn't exactly mountain fresh.
