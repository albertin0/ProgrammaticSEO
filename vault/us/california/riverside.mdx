Alright, Riverside, if you're looking to get those miles in today, February 26th, you've hit a pretty sweet spot weather-wise, but don't get too comfortable – the city's still a minefield of orange cones and detours.

<LungsJointsScore score={9} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lungs are in the clear:** AQI is good, pollen count is low. Breathe deep, buttercup.
*   **Temps are prime:** Mid-70s and clear skies? That’s about as good as it gets for a winter run.
*   **Roads are a warzone:** Seriously, if you're planning a long ride or run, you're going to hit construction. Expect detours and delays.
*   **High country is off-limits:** Some of our favorite mountain trails are still closed.
</BulletList>

### Environmental Breakdown

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant | Temperature | Condition |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- | :---------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 47  | Inhalable PM (&lt;10µm) | 22.8°C (73°F) | Clear     |

### Today's Local Lowdown: Don't Get Plowed Over

Look, the air quality is fantastic today with an AQI of 47 and barely any pollen, so your lungs are getting a break. The temperature is sitting pretty at 73 degrees Fahrenheit, under clear skies, which is basically perfect running weather. But before you lace up and blast out the door, remember this isn't some pristine, untouched wilderness. This is Riverside, and we're always under construction.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Chaos on Major Arteries:** If your workout route involves crossing or running near the **SR-91 or I-215**, be prepared for a headache. The SR-91 Pavement Rehabilitation Project started earlier this month and will be causing lane and ramp closures, sometimes even overnight. Similarly, there's active construction on I-215 between Martin Luther King Blvd and SR-60/91, with lane and ramp closures possibly kicking off as early as 7 p.m. Drive, bike, or run with your head on a swivel. Seriously, drivers are already distracted enough.
</AlertBox>

### Santa Ana River Trail Detours

For those of us who rely on the **Santa Ana River Trail** for our escape, listen up. The Riverside Levees Rehabilitation Project means parts of the trail have detours in place. Expect these temporary re-routes between Riverside Avenue/Main Street and Columbia Avenue, and potentially other sections later in the spring. They say the trail remains open, but you need to follow the signage and proceed with extreme caution around any heavy machinery or workers. Don't be that person who ignores the signs and gets tangled up in a construction zone. It's not a shortcut, it's a hazard.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Mt. Baldy Trails Are CLOSED!** If you're a mountain goat looking for elevation, hold your horses. A temporary closure for National Forest System trails within the Mount Baldy area (that's the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, for the uninitiated) is in effect *today*, February 26, 2026. This is for public safety. Don't try to be a hero and sneak around the closures – fines are real, and rescue operations are a pain for everyone involved. Give those trails time to heal and clear.

No active wildfires or smoke alerts are messing with our air quality right now, which is a huge win for Southern California. However, the city is still pushing wildfire preparedness, so remember that risk is always lingering. Keep an eye on local news, especially as we head into warmer months.
