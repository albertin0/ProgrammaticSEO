It's a pretty decent day to get outside in Riverside, but don't go thinking it's perfect; there are always a few thorns in the rose bush around here.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  *   **Air Quality's a Mixed Bag:** The official AQI is clocking in at 55, which is "Moderate" on paper. But let's be real, AccuWeather is already calling it "Poor" for sensitive folks, primarily due to inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) that likes to hang around our lungs. Those lingering particulates from whatever's usually burning out here – even if it's not a fresh wildfire, the air doesn't just magically clear itself overnight – mean you'll be breathing in more than just that crisp, *clear* air the weather report promises.
  *   **Pollen's Being a Jerk:** While some might tell you pollen is "low," don't trust it. WeatherBug says we're sitting at a "medium-high" to "high range" for Ash and Alder pollen. So if you're prone to turning into a sniffling, sneezing mess, today's your day to suffer. Your eyes will water, your nose will run, and you'll probably blame it on emotional exhaustion from your workout, but we both know better.
  *   **Warm for February:** We're looking at a high of almost 90°F today, which is wild for late February. Yesterday shattered records at 92°F, so while it's "cooling," it's still hotter than it should be. Don't be a hero; hydrate.
  *   **Santa Ana River Trail Shenanigans:** Expect detours. The Riverside Levees Rehabilitation Project means parts of the Santa Ana River Trail, specifically between Riverside Avenue/Main Street and Columbia Avenue, are going to be a construction zone until at least July. Planning your long ride or run there? Better scout an alternate route or prepare for some creative navigation around construction equipment.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level (WeatherBug) |
| :---------- | :----------------- |
| Ash         | Medium-High        |
| Alder       | Medium-High        |
| Overall     | High Range         |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Sensitive Groups, Pay Attention to Your Lungs:** With a "Moderate" AQI that's tilting towards "Poor" for sensitive groups due to &lt;10µm particulate matter, and high pollen counts, anyone with respiratory issues (asthma, allergies) or heart conditions should seriously consider an indoor workout. If you absolutely *must* run outside, keep it short and easy, and watch for symptoms like difficulty breathing or throat irritation.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Santa Ana River Trail Detour Alert:** The Riverside Levees Rehabilitation Project is impacting sections of the Santa Ana River Trail. Currently, you'll find detours between Riverside Avenue/Main Street and Columbia Avenue. Don't assume your usual path is clear. Check local signage and be ready to adjust your route to avoid heavy equipment and active construction zones.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Hydrate, You Idiots!** It's almost 90 degrees in February. That's not normal, and it can catch you off guard. Don't wait until you're already parched. Bring more water than you think you need, especially if you're out for anything longer than a quick jaunt. Heat exhaustion is no joke, and you'll look like a fool passed out on the side of Victoria Avenue.
