Today's a "know your route and keep your head on a swivel" kind of day if you're planning to get out there.

<BulletList>
*   That AQI reading isn't stellar, folks. We're looking at moderate air quality with ozone being the main culprit. That's a classic Fresno lung-burner in the making.
*   Construction is still a widespread beast across the city. Expect detours, uneven surfaces, and potential dust, especially if you're near major development zones.
*   On the bright side, the temperature is absolutely prime for a run, but don't let the clear skies make you complacent about the other hazards.

## The Air: Breathe Smart, Fresno

Let's talk about that Air Quality Index. An AQI of 65 with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't terrible, but it's not exactly "take a deep breath and feel refreshed" either. Ozone at this level can irritate your respiratory system, especially if you're pushing hard. If you feel any chest tightness, coughing, or shortness of breath, back off the intensity or cut your workout short. You're not going for an Olympic medal today, you're trying to stay healthy.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Today's moderate AQI with dominant ozone means some folks might feel it in their lungs. Consider sticking to routes with less traffic or opting for an indoor session if you're sensitive to air pollution.

## Pavement & Paths: A Minefield of Progress

The City of Fresno is busy, and that means our roads and trails are constantly changing. High-Speed Rail work is still a thing, causing various lane and sidewalk closures. For example, if you typically weave through areas like Olive and West Avenues, or down by Cedar and Central Avenues, expect diversions through at least the end of the week. This isn't just an inconvenience; it means unexpected obstacles, reduced shoulder space, and sometimes, no sidewalk at all.

Speaking of trails, the McKinley Avenue Trail between Millbrook and Clovis is almost done, with electrical work still going on for lighting. So, while improvements are coming, be aware of ongoing activity if you're near that stretch. And forget about a clear run along the Herndon Canal Trail from Shields to McKinley anytime soon; it's still in the design phase, with construction funded for fiscal year 2027. You're going to have to make your own adventure there for a while longer.

<AlertBox type="danger">
Widespread construction across Fresno means unexpected road closures, detours, and uneven surfaces. Always stay vigilant, especially if you're running or cycling on city streets. A quick check of the City of Fresno's road restrictions page before you head out isn't a bad idea.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Level | Dominant Types |
| :----------- | :------------- |
| Low          | N/A            |

Good news on the allergy front, pollen is low today, so your sinuses should be relatively clear. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's a completely clear shot for your respiratory system with that ozone hanging around.

<AlertBox type="info">
Remember, even with low pollen, the moderate ozone levels can be a trigger for some. Listen to your body and adjust your activity accordingly. And please, for the love of all that is holy, if you're checking out the Blossom Trail, admire those beautiful orchards from the road. They are private property, and trespassing isn't cool.
