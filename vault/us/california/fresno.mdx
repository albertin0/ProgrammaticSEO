Alright, Fresno, listen up. Don't let that clear sky fool you – your lungs might not be thanking you if you push it too hard out there today.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Sketchy:** While the official AQI clocks in at 84, which is technically "Moderate," AccuWeather is calling today's air "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups." The dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter, the stuff that sneaks deep into your lungs and causes trouble. If you've got any respiratory issues, seriously consider staying inside or hitting the treadmill.
*   **Construction Zone Central:** Our fair city is a perpetual construction site, and today is no different. Expect ongoing work around the Herndon Avenue widening project and the McKinley Avenue Trail, where electrical work is still underway. High-Speed Rail work is also causing closures on Fresno Street and China Alley. Stay alert.
*   **Pollen is Playing Nice:** Good news for allergy sufferers, pollen levels are low today. One less thing to sneeze about.
*   **Temps are Tolerable:** We're looking at a decent 15.8°C, which is pretty comfortable for a run if you can get past the other issues. No extreme heat or cold to worry about.

### Air Quality Details

The air quality around Fresno is a mixed bag today. The official Air Quality Index is 84, categorized as Moderate. However, AccuWeather warns that the air quality is "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups" due to fine particulate matter. This means if you're prone to asthma, bronchitis, or just generally have sensitive lungs, today might be a good day for a chill yoga session instead of hammering out miles on the River Park Trail. Even for healthy individuals, prolonged exposure could lead to some irritation. Don't be a hero; listen to your body.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads up on Herndon!** The Herndon Avenue widening project continues. While it promises a future Class I bike path, current construction can mean uneven surfaces, unexpected detours, and heavy equipment. Keep your eyes peeled, especially if you're cycling or running near the North Milburn and North Polk Avenues stretch.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Watch for Particulates:** With fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant and "Poor" air quality for sensitive groups, pushing intense cardio outdoors today is a gamble. If you start feeling any chest tightness, coughing, or unusual fatigue, cut your workout short and head indoors. Your long-term health is more important than one training run.

**Hydration is always key, but especially when air quality is questionable.** Drink plenty of water to help your body process any airborne irritants. And if you have an N95 mask, today might be the day to dust it off for your outdoor excursion.
