Today's a mixed bag, Fresno. If you're out there pounding the pavement early, you're playing Russian roulette with visibility, but by afternoon, it's actually pretty decent.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Morning Fogged In:** A Dense Fog Advisory was in effect until 10 AM this morning, making those early runs a real hazard. Seriously, you couldn't see a thing.
*   **Moderate Lung Burn:** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a "moderate" 83 today, with inhalable particulate matter doing its usual Central Valley thing.
*   **Pollen Relief:** Good news for your sinuses, pollen counts are staying low.
</BulletList>

### Morning Fog Was No Joke

If you were out before 10 AM, you saw it. The entire Central Valley, including us here in Fresno, was under a Dense Fog Advisory. That means visibility was down to a quarter-mile or less in some spots. Running in that kind of soup isn't just annoying; it's genuinely dangerous. Drivers can barely see you, and if you're not paying attention, a misplaced foot on a curb or an uneven sidewalk can send you straight to my office with an ankle sprain. I've seen it too many times.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Early Morning Fog:** Visibility was extremely low in parts of Fresno County this morning due to a Dense Fog Advisory. If you ran before 10 AM, you took a significant risk. For future foggy mornings, assume no one sees you and stay indoors or head to a treadmill.

### Your Lungs Are Doing Okay, For Fresno

The AQI hitting 83 isn't ideal, but it's not the worst we've seen. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), which means that lovely haze you sometimes see isn't just aesthetics; it's tiny stuff your lungs are breathing in. For those of us with sensitive airways or who are putting in hard efforts, it's enough to feel.

Pollen, thankfully, is on the low side. So at least you won't be snotting all over yourself mid-stride, which is a small victory.

### Weather Outlook: Clear Skies, Pleasant Temps

The good news is that by now, the fog has lifted, and the weather is clear with a comfortable temperature around 17.1°C (about 63°F). This makes for a pretty pleasant afternoon workout if you missed your morning window. Perfect for a leisurely jog around Woodward Park, assuming you paid the entrance fee or snagged an annual pass.

### Ongoing City Projects

While there are no new, specific workout *hazards* reported in the last 24 hours from construction, always be aware of ongoing projects. The city has plans to widen Herndon Avenue, adding a Class I bike path and pedestrian trail, which is great for the future, but means detours and new obstacles during construction. Also, keep an eye on the San Joaquin River Trail; while some ADA improvements and expansions are planned for *this fall*, it's a reminder that our trails are always evolving.

Remember, the Blossom Trail is gearing up for events starting this weekend and into March, so if you're planning a scenic ride or run there, keep an eye on the event schedules for any potential crowds.

**Workout Tip:** On moderate AQI days, consider reducing the intensity or duration of your outdoor workout, especially if you're doing high-impact cardio. You're trying to build endurance, not test your lung's filtration system.
