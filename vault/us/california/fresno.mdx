Fresno, today is a mixed bag for hitting the pavement, but mostly on the decent side if you know where to look.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Ozone levels are hovering in the "Moderate" range, so your lungs might feel it if you push too hard, especially on an intense run.
*   Expect road work headaches around Highway 41 and various city streets thanks to Caltrans and high-speed rail projects; don't assume your usual route is clear.
*   Enjoy the mild, clear weather, but prepare for increased vehicle and bike traffic if you're venturing near the scenic Blossom Trail this time of year.
</BulletList>

Alright, runners, let's talk about today, February 26th. The good news: we've got some pretty sweet, clear weather at a comfortable 18.4°C (that's about 65°F for those still stuck in Fahrenheit land). Perfect running temps, no complaints there.

The not-so-great news, particularly for those of us who actually *use* our lungs, is the air quality. While it's not a complete disaster, our Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at 78, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. That's "Moderate," which means most of you hard-asses will be fine, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally grumpy lungs, you might want to dial back the intensity a notch. You'll definitely feel that ozone if you're pushing a hard tempo run around Woodward Park, so maybe consider a recovery day or stick to some easy miles.

On the bright side, pollen is "Low," so at least your nose won't be staging a full-scale rebellion against your face. You win some, you lose some, right?

Now, let's address the real concrete jungle out there: construction. Caltrans is at it again. Today, the southbound Highway 41 onramp at M Street is closed for pavement repairs from 8 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. And if you usually hit the northbound Highway 41 lanes, know that there are closures from Central Avenue to North Avenue today as well. This means traffic jams, stressed drivers, and potentially less safe shoulders if you're trying to skirt around it.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Construction Chaos Alert: Your Usual Routes Might Be Screwed.**
High-speed rail construction is still a thing, and it's messing with our streets. Expect lane and sidewalk closures along Olive and West Avenues through tomorrow, February 27th. H Street also has lane closures until March 20th, and even McKinley, Weber, and West Avenues are seeing road closures until March 2nd. If you're running downtown or near these arteries, plan your route meticulously or you'll be dodging cones and angry commuters. These aren't just minor inconveniences; they're legitimate safety hazards if you're not paying attention.

Finally, it's Blossom Trail season, which sounds idyllic, and it mostly is. The orchards are beautiful, and it's a great excuse for a long bike ride or scenic run. However, remember it's a "self-guided motor or bicycle tour" through mid-March. This means more cars and more bikes on those usually quiet rural roads.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Blossom Trail Etiquette: Don't Be *That* Person.**
If you're out enjoying the Blossom Trail, remember those orchards are private property. Stick to the road shoulders and **do not enter any orchard.** It's trespassing, and those farmers don't mess around. Plus, some of them have actual farm dogs, and trust me, you don't want to meet them on their home turf.
</AlertBox>

All things considered, it's a decent day for a workout, especially if you stick to your local park or known trails like those at Woodward. Just be smart about the air and even smarter about the roads.
