Alright, San Bernardino, let's talk about hitting the trails today. If you're planning on a leisurely stroll through the flatlands, you're mostly good, but don't even *think* about tackling those higher mountain trails without a serious heads-up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  - The air quality is sitting in the "moderate" zone, primarily thanks to inhalable particulate matter (PM10). If your lungs usually complain, they'll probably have something to say after a hard session today.
  - Portions of the San Bernardino National Forest are still locked down due to recent and ongoing fire activity. Ignorance isn't bliss when you're facing a fine or worse.
  - While we're past the big storm, higher elevations could still be holding onto some ice and snow, making for treacherous footing on unprepared trails.
</BulletList>

## The Rundown: Don't Be a Statistic

Look, the sun's out and it's a decent 17.4°C (that's about 63°F for the Fahrenheit folks), which sounds perfect, right? Almost. But "clear" skies don't always mean clear air, and "moderate" AQI isn't exactly sparkling, especially when that dominant pollutant is something you can inhale straight into your lungs. You're not going to feel it on a walk around Shandin Hills Park, but if you're pushing hard, your body will notice.

### Air Quality Reality Check

While a 59 AQI isn't going to trigger any widespread alarms, it's enough for those of us with sensitive respiratory systems to feel it. The experts say that for AQI between 51 and 100, unusually sensitive individuals should "consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion." So if you're asthmatic or just generally get wheezy, take it easy. Maybe opt for less intense cardio, or keep it short. Don't be that hero coughing up a lung by the time you hit Baseline.

### Mountain Mayhem

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **STAY OUT OF FIRE CLOSURE AREAS!** Seriously. Parts of the San Bernardino National Forest are explicitly closed due to past and ongoing fire issues. For example, the Radford Fire Closure Area, which includes popular spots like Skyline Trail (1E12), is off-limits until the end of 2026. We've also had recent fire activity with the "Canyon House Rd Morongo Fire" reported just yesterday. Don't be the idiot who needs rescuing because you ignored the signs.
</AlertBox>

Even if a trail isn't officially closed for fire, remember that the mountains just saw a "major winter storm" last week. While the immediate warning is gone, higher elevations can retain snow and ice long after the city melts. That trail up near Mount Baldy that was closed until *today* for winter weather? Don't assume it's magically pristine. If you're heading up, check conditions *before* you drive all the way out there.

### Construction Zone Ahead

<AlertBox type="warning">
  Expect traffic delays and potential pedestrian detours around the Waterman Avenue / 210 Freeway interchange. Construction work has recently ramped up there, expected to continue through October. If your route takes you through that area, give yourself extra time or find an alternate path.
</AlertBox>

On the brighter side, the Santa Ana River Trail recently had an 11-mile expansion open up, connecting Waterman Avenue to California Street in Redlands. It's generally flatter, open, and a solid bet if you want to avoid the mountain hazards and construction headaches. Just, you know, still mind the moderate AQI.

At least your allergies aren't trying to murder you today. That's something.
