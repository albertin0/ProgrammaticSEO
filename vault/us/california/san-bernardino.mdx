Alright, San Bernardino, it's a mixed bag today. You *can* get outside, but you better pick your spot carefully and maybe bring a mask.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Moderate:** AQI is sitting at 63, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the main culprit. That means it’s not terrible, but sensitive folks might feel it.
*   **Pleasant Weather:** We've got clear skies and a comfortable 18.6°C. Perfect running weather if your lungs are up to it.
*   **Pollen is Low:** Allergies won't be kicking your butt today, which is a rare win for our local flora.
*   **Major Road Closure:** University Parkway at the I-215 is completely shut down for a good chunk of the weekend for interchange work. Plan your routes, especially if you're trying to get anywhere near Cal State.
*   **Mountain Trails Still Messy:** Don't even think about hitting many of the higher elevation trails in the San Bernardino National Forest without checking specific closures. Storm damage and seasonal winter closures have a lot of routes locked down.

### What's Up (and Down) Today

The weather is looking prime for a February day in San Bernardino. We're talking clear skies and a gentle 18.6°C (around 65°F), which is pretty much ideal for pounding the pavement or hitting a local path. Add to that a "Low" pollen count, and you'd think it's a perfect 10, right? Almost.

The fly in the ointment is our air quality. The AQI is clocking in at 63, which falls into the "Moderate" category. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, which basically means there's a bunch of tiny crud floating around that can irritate your lungs. If you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally sensitive airways, you might want to dial back the intensity or stick to an indoor workout. Active kids and adults, and anyone with respiratory disease, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. Honestly, for some of you, an N95 mask might not be a bad idea if you're out for a long haul.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Steer Clear of Most Mountain Trails!** Many roads and trails in the **San Bernardino National Forest** are still closed due to past storm damage and ongoing seasonal winter closures. This isn't just a suggestion; it's a safety issue. Don't risk it unless you've got a verified, *recent* update directly from the Forest Service. Seriously, check their website before you even think about heading up there. Roads like 1N01 Pipes Canyon, 1N02 Coon Creek Jumpoff, and many others remain inaccessible.

On the bright side, if you're sticking to the flatlands, there's good news for runners and cyclists: the **Santa Ana River Trail** has recently expanded, offering eleven continuous miles for you to enjoy. That's a solid win for local outdoor enthusiasts looking for some uninterrupted mileage.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**University Parkway Closure:** Heads up, folks navigating around the north side of town. University Parkway at the I-215 Freeway is under a full, 55-hour closure this weekend, from Friday evening through Monday morning (March 2). They're reconfiguring it into a Diverging Diamond Interchange, which sounds fancy but means major traffic delays and detours if you're trying to get through. Plan an alternate route if your run or ride takes you anywhere near that mess.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration is Key (Always):** Even on a comfortable day like this, you're still in Southern California. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout. Don't be that person who cramps up halfway through because you thought 18 degrees was "cool enough."
