You want to get outside today, San Bernardino? You've got options, but don't be a fool about it. That sun's packing a punch, and the mountain air might be doing the same.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Heat's a Beast:** We're looking at highs in the upper 80s, possibly even nudging 90°F. In late February! That's not "pleasant," that's "stupidly warm for a hard effort."
*   **Wind Advisory for the High Ground:** Those higher elevations in the San Bernardino National Forest could see gusts up to 35 mph tonight. Don't go getting blown off a ridge.
*   **Persistent Closures:** Don't even think about hitting certain areas of the San Bernardino National Forest or trails like Skyline Trail. The Radford Fire Closure Area is still firmly in place through the end of 2026.

### Today's Vitals

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant                  | Temperature       | Condition |
| :----------- | :---- | :---------------------------------- | :---------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 57    | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) | 23.4°C (74.1°F)* | Clear     |

*Hold up, though. While the official weather given is 23.4°C, AccuWeather is calling for a high of 87°F today, possibly hitting 90°F, nearing a record. Expect it to feel hotter than the listed 'current' temp.*

#### Seriously, Hydrate or Die-drate

Look, 87-90 degrees in February is just asking for trouble if you're not paying attention. Your body isn't acclimated to this garbage yet. If you're running, cycling, or doing anything more strenuous than walking to your fridge, carry way more water than you think you need. Dehydration isn't a badge of honor; it's a trip to the emergency room, and they charge extra for that.

### Trail Talk & Local Lowdown

It’s tempting to hit the trails when it’s "clear," but a clear sky doesn't mean clear trails. Remember that massive Radford Fire? Well, its legacy lives on. The **Radford Fire Closure Area** in the San Bernardino National Forest, which includes popular spots like the **Skyline Trail**, is still off-limits. They put that order in place clear back on February 26, 2025, and it's not lifting until December 31, 2026. So, save yourself the wasted drive and a potential fine. Stay out of closed areas.

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Mountain Winds are No Joke

While it might be calm down here in the valley, the National Weather Service is forecasting winds of 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 35 mph in the San Bernardino County Mountains tonight. If your plan involves any exposed ridge lines or areas with loose rock or debris, seriously reconsider. A strong gust can put you on your ass, or worse, over the edge.
</AlertBox>

On the brighter side, if you're sticking to the flatter stuff, the expanded **Santa Ana River Trail** is open for business, giving you eleven continuous miles to pedal or stride. Just remember that AQI is moderate due to particulate matter, so if you've got sensitive lungs, take it easy or stick to indoor workouts today.

<AlertBox type="info">
#### Check Fire Risk, Always

Even though there aren't any massive new fires scorching the immediate area today, the fire risk is "Moderate" and bumps up to "High" tomorrow. That dry air and warmth mean things can go sideways fast. Be vigilant, report anything suspicious, and for the love of all that's holy, don't be flicking cigarette butts out your window.
