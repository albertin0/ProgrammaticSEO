Today's a decent day to get outside in Pomona, but don't let the sunshine fool you into thinking it's completely clear sailing.

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality's a Mixed Bag:** While our local air quality is sitting at a "Moderate" AQI of 61, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant according to current readings, don't ignore it. Some reports still flag the air as "Poor" for sensitive groups. If you’ve got any respiratory issues, pay attention to how you feel, especially if you're pushing it.
*   **Pollen is Pervasive:** "Moderate" pollen levels are hanging around, primarily from Ash and Alder. If your nose or eyes are already itching, today's run might leave you feeling a bit ragged.
*   **Heat is On the Rise:** We're starting clear and pleasant at 16.9°C, but the forecast is calling for highs near 84°F (around 29°C) today, climbing even higher to 89°F (around 31°C) tomorrow. Don't get caught out without enough water.

Look, the weather itself is mostly gorgeous. Clear skies and warm temperatures are usually what we dream of here. However, the environmental factors mean you need to be smart about your workout. If you're planning on hitting the trails, say, up at Marshall Canyon, be prepared. While there haven't been any *new* significant trail closures reported in the last 24 hours that would affect specific local spots in Pomona, keeping an eye on your immediate surroundings is always wise.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up on the Heat:** With temperatures pushing into the upper 80s and even near 90°F by Friday, hydration is non-negotiable. Plan your longer runs or rides for earlier in the morning or later in the evening to avoid the peak heat. Listen to your body – overheating is a real risk.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pollen Prep:** If you're prone to allergies, consider an antihistamine before you head out. Shower immediately after your workout to rinse off any lingering pollen, and try to avoid rubbing your eyes with dusty hands. Your lungs will thank you, and your post-run selfie won't be ruined by puffy eyes.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Check Your Route for Construction:** While no major new, specific workout-impacting construction advisories were issued for Pomona in the last 24 hours, local projects are always ongoing. Areas around major thoroughfares or planned city improvements (like the "Pomona Safe And Active Improvements" near Hamilton Boulevard and Park Avenue) could have minor detours or sidewalk work. Always stay alert.

Overall, it's a "go" for outdoor activity, but with caveats. Don't be a hero; take precautions for the air quality and the rising heat. Enjoy those sunny Pomona miles, but do it smart.
