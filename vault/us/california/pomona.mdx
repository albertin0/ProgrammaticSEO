Alright Pomona, if you're thinking about a run today, it's mostly good to go, but don't expect a pristine, effort-free experience.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **AQI is just okay:** Hovering at 55 with inhalable particulate matter means your lungs will notice it, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   **Pollen's making its presence known:** "Moderate" level for pollen means allergy sufferers might be sneezing their way through the latter half of their route.
*   **Warm weather means you need to hydrate:** While clear skies are nice, a current 23.7°C (74.6°F) and a forecasted high of 83°F is warm enough to make you sweat buckets if you're not careful.
</BulletList>

### Today's Environmental Breakdown:

| Pollutant Type       | Level    | Details                                  |
| :------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Air Quality Index    | 55       | Moderate (Dominant Pollutant: &lt;10µm) |
| Pollen               | Moderate | Seasonal allergens                      |
| Temperature          | 23.7°C   | Clear skies                            |

Look, the air isn't exactly crisp mountain air, is it? An AQI of 55 with those pesky inhalable particulates means if you've got sensitive lungs or asthma, you'll be feeling it more than usual. Don't be surprised if your usual route feels a little heavier. Pair that with a "Moderate" pollen count, and you've got a recipe for watery eyes and an itchy throat, particularly if you're hitting up any of the greener spots like around Palomares Park. That nice, clear sky and 23.7°C (about 75°F) sounds inviting, but remember, the sun's still doing its job, and AccuWeather is predicting it could hit 83°F. That's not "extreme heat" territory, but it's enough to cook you if you're not smart about hydration.

### Local Lowdown:

There's no major trail-blocking chaos to report in Pomona today, which is always a small victory. However, those of you using the areas around Palomares Park might encounter a bit more vehicle or pedestrian traffic this evening. The city's got a "Complete Streets and Quick Build Project" public meeting happening there from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM. It's all about making streets safer for everyone, so that's a good thing long-term, but it means a little extra hubbub tonight.

The Metro A Line extension from Azusa to Pomona is already open, but the segment connecting Pomona to Claremont is still in the design phase, with major construction not expected until late 2027 or early 2028. So, no heavy equipment blocking your usual running paths there just yet.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heat Advisory (Self-Imposed):** While not an official NWS warning, running in the mid-70s to low-80s demands respect. Hydrate *before*, *during*, and *after* your run. Electrolytes aren't just for pros. If you're feeling lightheaded or your splits are way off, back it down. This isn't the day to PR your half-marathon, champ.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Allergy Attack Prevention:** If you're prone to seasonal allergies, pop your antihistamines *before* you head out. Consider wearing sunglasses to keep pollen out of your eyes and maybe even a light buff over your mouth if you're really sensitive to the particulate matter in the air. Shower and change immediately after your workout to get that pollen off you.
</AlertBox>

Overall, it’s not a terrible day, but it’s not perfect either. Be smart, listen to your body, and don't push your luck. There's always tomorrow.
