Alright, Pomona, step outside, but don't dawdle unless you're a lizard, because this morning's lovely weather is just a warm-up for a scorching afternoon.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Morning bliss, afternoon beast:** It's cool and clear *right now*, but the mercury is set to shoot up dramatically, making midday workouts a sweaty, miserable, and potentially dangerous affair.
*   **Spring sniffles:** Moderate pollen counts are definitely in the air, so expect some irritation if your sinuses usually stage a rebellion this time of year.
*   **Construction chaos:** Still dodging cones? Yeah, that's Pomona for you. Ongoing projects mean you'll need to stay alert and perhaps reroute your usual paths.

## Environmental Breakdown

### Heat Advisory: Seriously, Go Early or Stay Inside
While it's a perfect 19.1°C (66.4°F) this morning, forecasts are hitting the high 80s and even low 90s later today. That's not "sweaty but manageable," that's "risk of heat exhaustion." If you're planning a run or ride, get it done before 10 AM, or wait until after the sun starts dipping. Otherwise, you're just asking for trouble. Drink more water than you think you need, and then drink some more.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Muck: Moderate Pollen & AQI
Our AQI is sitting at 59, which is in the "moderate" zone, with inhalable particulate matter as the main culprit. Combine that with moderate pollen levels, and anyone with even a hint of allergies or asthma might feel a bit wheezy. Don't push it if your lungs are feeling it. This isn't the day for a PR if you're sensitive.

### Construction Detours: The Usual Pomona Shuffle
Still dealing with the usual concrete jungle out there. The Cal Poly Pomona campus, for example, has various construction projects ongoing, from a new Rocket Lab addition to Rose Float Lab work and the eventual CLA Tower demolition. This means parts of parking lots, pedestrian corridors, and roads might be fenced off or rerouted. Keep an eye out for signs and unexpected obstacles, especially if you're used to running or cycling near these areas. You don't want to trip over a stray rebar because you weren't paying attention.

No major trail closures due to fires or floods reported in the immediate Pomona area today, which is a win, I guess. But those Angeles National Forest trails, particularly around the Mount Baldy area, still have extended closures from past fire recovery, some lasting through late 2026 and 2027. So, if you're heading up to higher elevations, double-check before you drive all that way.
