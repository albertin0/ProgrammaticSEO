Look, if you absolutely *have* to get out there in Modesto today, it’s not the worst, but don't expect a personal best or crystal-clear lungs.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The Air Quality Index is hanging in the moderate range at 78, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. It’s not a red-alert day, but it’s definitely not doing your lungs any favors, especially if you're planning a hard effort or have any respiratory sensitivities. Don’t be surprised if that run feels a little heavier.
*   Roads around town are a genuine obstacle course. Forget about a smooth long run along Tuolumne Boulevard; it's still closed at the bridge and isn't slated to fully reopen until mid-June. Expect detours and general chaos from various lane closures on routes like Scenic Drive and Grimes Avenue. If you're cycling, be extra vigilant because drivers are already annoyed by the congestion.
*   While the sky is supposed to clear up, expect some dense fog in the San Joaquin Valley this morning. Visibility could be a real pain, making those early miles a bit of a guessing game, especially on less-trafficked paths.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up, Modesto Runners & Riders!**

The AQI at 78 means you're breathing in a fair amount of particulate matter. If you're asthmatic, have other lung conditions, or are just feeling sniffly, maybe scale back that outdoor workout or opt for the treadmill. This isn’t the day to push peak VO2 max if you’re sensitive to air quality. Also, those road closures around Tuolumne Boulevard are no joke; crossing the river, or running along it, is going to require serious detouring, so plan ahead or stick to routes you know are clear.

**Morning Fog & General Awareness**

Dense fog is expected in the valley this morning, so if you're hitting the streets early, wear reflective gear and assume no one can see you. Additionally, while it's not a new development, there have been past reports of attempted kidnappings near schools, including around Fairview Park. Always stay aware of your surroundings, especially if you're out alone or near park areas where incidents have occurred. Safety first, folks.
