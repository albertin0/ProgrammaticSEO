Alright, Modesto, if you're itching to get outside today, you *can*, but don't expect perfectly crisp air.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI is hanging out in the "yellow zone" for a reason. Ozone is the dominant pollutant, which means your lungs might feel it if you're pushing hard or are sensitive.
*   **Street-Level Hurdles:** There's still tree trimming happening around town with intermittent lane closures on a few key streets. Don't be surprised by cones or flaggers on your usual city routes.
*   **Mild Temperatures:** On the bright side, the temperature is pretty sweet at 16.3°C (about 61°F) with clear skies, so at least you won't be battling extreme heat or cold.
</BulletList>

## Your Lungs are the Priority Today

Let's be real, an AQI of 76 isn't a disaster, but it's not ideal either. For most of you weekend warriors, a moderate pace is fine. But if you've got asthma, COPD, or any other respiratory shenanigans, consider easing up or sticking to indoor workouts. The AccuWeather forecast even warns sensitive groups might experience "minor to moderate symptoms from long-term exposure" to this kind of air. Don't be a hero; listen to your body, especially with that ozone doing its thing.

Here's the lowdown on what you're breathing:

| Pollutant          | Level |
| :----------------- | :---- |
| Ozone              | Moderate |
| Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5)* | Fair |
| Pollen             | Low |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert for Sensitive Lungs:** If you're typically affected by air quality, this is your sign to dial back the intensity. Maybe skip that all-out sprint on the Virginia Corridor today and opt for a steady walk or a spin class instead. Prolonged exertion in moderate air quality can still be a drag.
</AlertBox>

## Mind the Modesto Maze: Construction Continues

Looks like City crews are still out there trimming trees, which means intermittent lane closures around areas like Grimes Avenue, Coffee Road, and Woodland Avenue until the end of the month. If your route takes you through these spots, expect some detours or reduced lanes. It's not a full-on road race, but it can mess with your rhythm and force you into traffic.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Plan Your Route:** If you're hitting the streets, do a quick check for current traffic impacts or consider sticking to designated paths like the Dry Creek Trail where you're less likely to contend with unexpected detours from tree trimmers.
</AlertBox>

Further out, for those who venture towards Riverbank, remember that the North County Corridor project is still causing significant closures on Roselle Avenue and Terminal Avenue. Those are longer-term closures, but if you're in the northern parts of Stanislaus County, they'll impact your commute to trailheads.

Overall, it's a mixed bag. Enjoy the nice temperature, but be smart about the air and keep an eye out for construction.
