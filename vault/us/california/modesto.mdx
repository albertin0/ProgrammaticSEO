Alright, Modesto. Today's not terrible, but let's just say you'll need to keep your head on a swivel more than usual if you're hitting the streets or trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
  *   **Air Quality is Meh (at best):** We're sitting at an AQI of 86, which is "Moderate." The kicker? Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) is the dominant pollutant. That stuff gets deep into your lungs. Even if you don't feel it, your respiratory system is working harder. Some forecasts even call today "Poor" for sensitive groups, so don't be a hero if you've got issues.
  *   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Modesto's a perpetual construction zone, and today's no exception. Think new roundabouts, lane closures, and general roadwork on major arteries.
  *   **Watch for Water (and drivers):** City crews are prepping for potential flooding near the Tuolumne River and Dry Creek. While not actively flooding right now, runoff can back up, so stay aware, especially if you're near those waterways. Oh, and drivers are still out there, sometimes not paying attention.

## The Rundown

Look, the weather's a clear 17.4°C, which is fantastic for getting outside. No extreme heat, no bone-chilling cold. Low pollen count means your allergies should mostly chill out. But don't let that fool you into complacency.

| Pollutant Type       | Level |
| :------------------- | :---- |
| Tree Pollen          | Low   |
| Grass Pollen         | Low   |
| Weed Pollen          | Low   |

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deep

AQI at 86 is borderline. The issue isn't so much the number as the "Fine particulate matter" being the problem. These tiny particles can irritate your eyes, nose, and especially your lungs, potentially worsening existing respiratory or heart conditions. If you're generally sensitive, maybe scale back that sprint interval session or consider an indoor alternative. No, running on the treadmill at In-Shape isn't "real" running, but neither is an emergency room visit.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **AQI Advisory:** With PM2.5 as the dominant pollutant and some sources calling it "Poor," sensitive individuals should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. Listen to your body – don't push through chest tightness or coughing.
</AlertBox>

### Construction Zone: Your New Obstacle Course

You want a challenging workout? Try navigating Modesto's current road situation. They're putting in new roundabouts on **9th Street** as part of the 9th Street Corridor Improvement project, and let me tell you, not everyone's a fan of how drivers are handling them. If you're cycling or running around there, assume drivers don't see you. Same goes for **Coffee Road** between Orangeburg and Scenic Drive, where you'll find delays, lane closures, and shifts. And don't even get me started on the ongoing closures on **Tuolumne Boulevard** near the bridge, limiting access to Highway 99. Seriously, plan your routes, or you'll be adding accidental detours to your mileage.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Construction Chaos on Major Roads:** Significant lane closures and shifts are active on 9th Street, Coffee Road, and Tuolumne Boulevard. These areas are hazardous for runners and cyclists due to unpredictable traffic flow and distracted drivers.
</AlertBox>

### Pelandale Avenue & Riverways: Pedestrian Peril

Just last week, a pedestrian was tragically killed trying to cross Pelandale Avenue near a canal. This isn't ancient history, folks. It's a stark reminder that even on familiar routes, you need to be hyper-vigilant. Look both ways, then look again. Assume every driver is on their phone.

Also, keep an eye on those river levels. While it's clear today, Modesto city crews are still monitoring the **Tuolumne River** and **Dry Creek** for potential flooding. If you usually run along the paths in Dry Creek Regional Park, be aware of soggy, uneven, or even closed sections if heavy releases are happening upstream.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Hydration Reminder:** Even with mild temperatures, clear skies mean direct sun exposure. Stay hydrated, especially on longer runs.
</AlertBox>

So, go run, but don't check your brain at the door. Modesto's out there, and it's got its own set of challenges today.
