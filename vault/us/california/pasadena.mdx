Alright, Pasadena, today's a mixed bag, so don't just blindly hit the trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Pollen count is through the roof, which means your lungs might feel like you just ran through a dust devil even if the AQI is "moderate."
*   Clear skies and temps around 21°C are gorgeous, but don't let that fool you into thinking all's well on the terrain.
*   Many of our favorite mountain trails are still officially off-limits, and for good reason.
</BulletList>

### The Allergy Apocalypse is Here

Look, the weather apps might be telling you it's a "clear" 20.7°C out there, and the AQI at 59 (Nitrogen dioxide, specifically) is sitting pretty in the "moderate" zone. [cite: air_quality, weather] That's all fine and dandy if you're planning to stay on the pavement or do some yard work. But if you're thinking of a decent run or hike, remember one thing: the pollen is "Very High." [cite: pollen] And I mean *very* high. Your sinuses are already plotting their revenge. Don't be surprised if that "moderate" AQI feels a lot worse when your body is already fighting an invisible war against every blooming thing in the San Gabriel Valley. Bring tissues, an inhaler if you need it, and maybe just embrace the snot rocket.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Pollen Bomb Incoming:** "Very High" pollen means respiratory irritation is a near certainty for allergy sufferers. Consider an indoor workout or stick to well-paved, lower-pollen areas like the Rose Bowl Loop.

### Our Mountains are Still Healing (and Closed)

I know you're itching to get up into the hills, but a lot of our prime spots are still nursing some serious wounds. The Eaton Canyon Falls trail, for instance, along with surrounding areas like the Altadena Crest Trail and parts of Chaney Trail, remain closed until the end of 2027. That January 2025 Eaton Fire did a real number on the landscape, stripping away the natural anchors that hold the soil. What does that mean for us? Even if it hasn't rained in a bit, those areas are still prone to dangerous debris flows, mudslides, and general instability.

Yes, it's a bummer, but it's for your own safety. Don't be "that guy" who ignores the closure signs. You're not just risking yourself; you're risking the first responders who have to come dig you out. And frankly, those crews have better things to do than rescue someone who thought a yellow "CLOSED" sign was just a suggestion.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Burn Scar Trails Remain Closed:** Stay OFF the closed trails, especially in Eaton Canyon and adjacent areas like Altadena Crest Trail and Chaney Trail. The ground is unstable post-fire, and debris flows are a serious risk. Closures are in effect until December 31, 2027.

### Construction Zone Ahead

Around town, expect your usual Pasadena construction shuffle. We've got ongoing sewer relining projects, pedestrian improvements on Allen Avenue, and various water main upgrades, including one targeted to start this month on Mountain Street between Lake and Hill Avenues. So, if your usual city running route takes you down one of those streets, be prepared for detours, sidewalk closures, and general traffic headaches. Keep your head up, be aware of your surroundings, and don't assume drivers see you. They're probably looking at their phone anyway.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Stay Hydrated, People!** Even with comfortable temperatures, it's easy to underestimate dehydration, especially when your body is working harder to deal with high pollen. Drink up.
