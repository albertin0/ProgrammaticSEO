If you're hitting the pavement in Pasadena today, make sure your allergy meds are locked and loaded, because your lungs are in for a rough ride.

<BulletList>
*   **Pollen Apocalypse:** "Very High" pollen means your respiratory system is basically running a marathon just breathing. Don't expect any PRs if you're battling seasonal allergies.
*   **Perfect Running Weather:** Seriously, 16.8°C and clear skies? That's prime for hitting the Arroyo Seco trails if you can ignore the airborne irritants.
*   **AQI is Deceiving:** While the overall Air Quality Index is "Good" at 50, the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter. That's not exactly a green light for deep breathing when your body's already fighting pollen.

### Today's Rundown

Look, Pasadena, the weather gods finally decided to play nice, dropping us a clear, comfortable 16.8°C day. Normally, I'd tell you to lace up and hit those trails by the Rose Bowl or take a long run down Orange Grove Boulevard. And for your joints, it's pretty much perfect – no bone-chilling cold or sweltering heat to complain about.

However, your lungs? They're going to hate you. We're in a full-blown "Very High" pollen situation. If you've got even a hint of seasonal allergies, you'll be sniffling, sneezing, and feeling like you just ran through a dust storm, even on a clear day.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Pollen Bomb:** That "Very High" pollen count isn't just a number; it's a real threat to your respiratory comfort and performance. Consider sticking to indoor workouts or hitting the gym if you're susceptible to allergies. If you *must* run outside, wear a mask, keep your inhaler handy (if applicable), and shower immediately afterward.
</AlertBox>

The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Good" 50, which sounds great on paper. But dig a little deeper, and the dominant pollutant is still inhalable particulate matter. While it's not at dangerous levels, pairing it with very high pollen means your airways are essentially doing double duty. It's like trying to run with ankle weights on your lungs.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate:** Even though it's not scorching, staying well-hydrated is crucial when your body is fighting off allergens and particulates. Water helps thin mucus and keeps your system running smoothly.
</AlertBox>

There's no recent news about wildfires, heavy construction blocking major running routes in Pasadena, high winds, or flooding to throw a wrench in your plans for today. The Eaton Fire in Altadena is still making headlines due to ongoing litigation, but it's not producing active smoke or air quality issues for us today. We did see some forecasts mentioning elevated fire concerns in the foothills and temperatures soaring into the 90s for Friday, February 27, so be prepared for *tomorrow* to be a scorcher, but today is not that day.

So, if you're one of those lucky few immune to pollen, enjoy the fantastic weather. For the rest of us, maybe it's a good day for a spin class or hitting the weights at home. Your lungs will thank you.
