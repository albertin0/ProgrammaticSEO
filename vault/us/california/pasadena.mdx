It's probably not the day to smash any PRs, especially if your lungs hate pollen more than they love that post-run high.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is *not* really the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Pasadena's Pollen Bomb:** Look, I get it, spring in Southern California is pretty, but the "Very High" pollen count today means your sinuses are going to hate you more than a marathoner hates chafing. Inhalable particulate matter is also still the dominant pollutant in our "Moderate" AQI, so don't be fooled by the clear skies – your lungs are working overtime.
*   **Fallen Trees (Seriously):** Just this morning, a huge tree decided to take a nap on a house and a car in Normandie Heights, ripping down power lines in the process. City officials have warned that our recent storms, even when the rain stops, leave the ground so saturated that tree failures can happen later. That means even if the skies are clear, the trails and sidewalks might be hiding hazards. Keep your head on a swivel.
*   **Eaton Canyon is Still a No-Go:** If you were planning on hitting up Eaton Canyon, think again. Those trails, along with Chaney Trail Road, are still closed until at least **December 31, 2027,** due to the fallout from the 2025 Eaton Fire. They're trying to let the land recover, and honestly, you don't want to be the person who falls into a mud pit or gets hit by delayed rockfall. Seriously, stay out.

### Watch Your Step (and Your Head)

While the sunshine might be tempting, the ground is still dicey from all the recent rain. A fallen tree already hit homes and cars this morning in Normandie Heights. That kind of instability means hidden dangers like loose branches or unexpected slips are definitely in play, especially on unpaved paths.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Eaton Canyon & Burn Scars are OFF LIMITS

Don't be a hero. The Eaton Fire might be old news, but its impact lingers. Trails and roads around Eaton Canyon and other burn areas are still officially closed, some for years, to protect both you and the environment trying to heal. Ignoring these closures isn't just selfish, it's dangerous. Mudslides and debris flows are a real threat in these areas, even on clear days, as saturated soil can give way without warning.

### AQI is Moderate, But Your Lungs Are Smarter

The AQI might say "Moderate" at 56, but with "Very High" pollen and inhalable particulate matter, anyone with even a hint of sensitivity is going to feel it. If you insist on outdoor activity, stick to flat, well-ventilated areas, away from any major roads or lingering construction dust. And seriously, consider an indoor workout instead. Your respiratory system will thank you.
