Alright, runners, today's one of those 'eh, could be worse' days for hitting the pavement in San Francisco. Don't expect heroics, just get it done.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Your lungs are dealing with a moderate AQI of 86, thanks to ozone. While there's no official "Spare the Air" alert for today, it's not exactly sparkling clean.
*   Construction around the city is still the gift that keeps on giving, especially if your route takes you near major thoroughfares. Expect detours and some extra grit.
*   Good news for the sniffle brigade: pollen levels are mercifully low. Your allergies get a pass today.

## The Daily Grind: Feb 26, 2026

So, you want to get your steps in? Fine. Just know what you're up against. The air quality isn't going to kill you today, but it's certainly not doing you any favors. That AQI of 86 with ozone as the dominant pollutant means your respiratory system is putting in a little extra work. We're not in full-blown "cough a lung out" territory like some of our wildfire summers, but it's enough to notice if you're pushing hard. Take it easy on the pace, especially if you're prone to any respiratory drama.

### Watch Your Step (and Your Head)

Beyond the air, our beloved city is a perpetual construction zone. If your usual loop involves downtown, particularly around Howard Street between The Embarcadero and 4th, prepare for intermittent delays and lane closures. These aren't just for cars; pedestrian and bike routes often get rejiggered without much warning. Same goes for the ongoing I-80 and Bay Bridge rehabilitation projects. They've got overnight ramp closures, including the Eastbound First St. Bay Bridge On Ramp tonight from 11:59 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., so if you're an early bird or late-night warrior, be aware. Don't assume your usual path is clear. Check SFMTA advisories before you head out, unless you enjoy impromptu urban parkour.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality:** With an AQI of 86 and ozone being the dominant pollutant, consider dialing back your intensity, especially if you're sensitive. It's not a Spare the Air *alert* day, but it's not optimal.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Chaos:** Traffic and pedestrian flow are still impacted by major projects. Expect detours and potential hazards around Howard Street, I-80 on/off-ramps, and the Bay Bridge approach. Pay attention to signage.
</AlertBox>

The weather itself is playing nice, clear skies and a mild 13.8°C (around 57°F). No rain to contend with, which is a rare treat this time of year. Just don't let the clear skies fool you into thinking the air is pristine.

If you're looking for a slightly less urban, though still *managed*, trail experience, remember that McLaren Park has had some trail improvement work, and while most is completed, they're still asking folks to stay on designated trails to protect new plantings and sensitive habitats. Good for some hills, less for dodging orange cones.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Tree        | Low     |
| Grass       | Low     |
| Weed        | Low     |

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydrate, Already!** Even on milder days, consistent hydration is key. Don't wait until you're already parched. Also, watch for those uneven surfaces around construction areas – twisted ankles are not part of anyone's training plan.
