Alright, get out there, but keep your head on a swivel because San Francisco always has something cooking.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Decent Weather for Striding:** Clear skies and a mild 13.7°C (about 57°F) means no excuses for skipping your long run today. The recent atmospheric river has moved on, so enjoy the break.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** While not always a direct running hazard, the sheer volume of ongoing construction across the city means detours, uneven sidewalks, and heavy vehicle traffic in spots. Areas around UCSF Parnassus Heights are seeing "heightened construction noise and vibration" and protective netting, with weekend closures on Medical Center Way anticipated. New projects are also breaking ground in Bayview-Hunters Point and excavation is underway at Potrero Power Station Block 2.
*   **Moderate Air, Low Pollen:** Your lungs get a break from the usual Bay Area allergies with "Low" pollen levels, but the Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 84, thanks to Nitrogen dioxide. This isn't ideal, especially if you're prone to respiratory irritation.

## Today's Vibe: Mild But Mindful

Today is shaping up to be one of those classic San Francisco days where the weather itself isn't actively trying to kill you. The sun's out, the temperature is mild, and frankly, after the drenching we've had recently, a clear day feels like a gift from the universe. Just last week, we were still dealing with the tail end of a long-duration atmospheric river, which means a lot of our usual routes might still be a bit... soggy.

But don't get complacent. This city is always in motion, and that often means dodging more than just slow tourists on the Golden Gate Bridge path. Speaking of, if you're hitting up Golden Gate Park for some mileage, remember that all that recent rain could still mean muddy patches on the trails, especially the dirt ones around the Japanese Tea Garden or Stow Lake. Watch your footing to avoid an ankle twist – nobody wants a spontaneous trip to the physical therapist.

### Air Quality & Allergens

| Pollutant          | Level           |
| :----------------- | :-------------- |
| Tree Pollen        | Low             |
| Grass Pollen       | Low             |
| Ragweed Pollen     | Low             |
| Dominant Pollutant | Nitrogen dioxide |

The good news? Your allergies should be mostly chill today, with all pollen levels showing as "Low." So, no need to load up on antihistamines just to enjoy a jog.

The not-so-great news? Our AQI is sitting at a "Moderate" 84, with Nitrogen dioxide as the main culprit. That's code for "too many cars" if you ask me. It's not alarm-bell territory, but if you're pushing hard or have sensitive lungs, consider sticking to routes with less direct vehicle exhaust, maybe a path further from the street or head to a greener area.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Zone Awareness:** Multiple significant construction projects are active city-wide. Expect detours, sidewalk closures, and heavy equipment traffic in areas like Parnassus Heights, Potrero Hill, and around new developments in SoMa. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially if you're running with headphones.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Event Impact Heads-Up:** Planning an evening workout around the Chase Center? Be aware of potential street closures and increased traffic starting two hours before and lasting an hour after events like concerts or Warriors games. For Friday evening, the Sunset Night Market on Irving Street between 20th and 25th avenues will cause closures from noon to almost midnight.
</AlertBox>

Bottom line: Today's a decent day to sweat. Just remember it's San Francisco, so there's always a pothole, a rogue construction detour, or a waft of urban exhaust waiting to surprise you. Stay alert, be safe, and earn those miles.
