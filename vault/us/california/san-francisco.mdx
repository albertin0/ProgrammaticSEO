Alright, San Francisco, another Saturday is upon us. Is it a good day to get those miles in? Maybe. If you don't mind navigating around some usual city shenanigans and keeping an eye on the thermometer.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **A decent day for lungs, but watch the PM10.** Your friendly neighborhood data says AQI is 75 with inhalable particulate matter dominating. That's "Moderate," meaning if you've got finicky lungs, you might feel it. Pollen is thankfully low, so at least that's one less thing to sneeze about.
*   **Sunshine with a side of heat.** We're looking at a high near 77°F (around 25°C) today. If you're out there hitting the pavement around lunch, that's not exactly "foggy summer" weather. Hydrate, people. It's February, but SF decided to throw a curveball.
*   **Trail closures are the usual city headache.** Forget about a clear run through Corona Heights Park today; those North and Peak trails are still off-limits thanks to old storm damage. And if your route takes you through Golden Gate Park, remember those perpetual weekend road closures are in full effect, snarling vehicle *and* potentially pedestrian access on spots like JFK Drive.

## The Full Breakdown

### Air Quality & Allergens

The city's air quality is hovering in the moderate zone today with an AQI of 75, primarily due to inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). While not hitting "unhealthy" levels, it's enough to give some of us pause. You might see other reports saying "Good", but for today, let's stick with the provided moderate reading and exercise a bit of caution. If you're prone to respiratory irritation, maybe stick to shorter, less intense efforts, or consider a route away from heavy traffic. The good news? Pollen levels are low, so your eyes and nose get a break from the usual seasonal torment.

| Pollutant Type | Level |
|:---------------|:------|
| Overall AQI    | 75    |
| Dominant       | PM10  |
| Pollen         | Low   |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate AQI for PM10 (75) today.** While it's not a full-blown "Spare the Air" day (which usually kicks in above 80 AQI for PM2.5, or 100 for Ozone), sensitive groups (the elderly, children, and anyone with heart or lung disease) should probably take it easy. If your chest feels tight or you're coughing more than usual, it's not just that hill on Divisadero. Cut it short.

### Weather Woes

It's going to be a pretty clear morning, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a cool Bay Area breeze all day. The National Weather Service is calling for a high near 77°F (around 25°C) in downtown San Francisco today. That's a significant warm-up from our typical February temperatures and certainly from the morning's cooler start. If you're planning a longer workout, aim for earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid the peak heat. And for Pete's sake, bring water. Dehydration is no joke, especially when you're pushing it.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration is key today.** With temps climbing to the mid-70s, it's easy to get caught off guard. Carry more water than you think you need, especially on longer runs or rides. Sunscreen isn't just for summer, either.

### Construction & Trail Obstacles

Here's where San Francisco truly shines with its unique challenges. If your usual loop takes you through **Corona Heights Park**, be aware that the North and Peak trails are still closed. Storm damage is the culprit, so plan an alternate route or risk a dead end and extra frustration.

Also, if you're attempting to cruise through **Golden Gate Park** on wheels or by foot, prepare for the usual weekend circus. Roads like JFK Drive and Transverse Drive regularly see closures. Check the SF Rec & Park website before you head out, or embrace the detours as part of your "adventure" run. Upper Fort Mason is also still dealing with long-term utility and seismic work through Fall 2026, so expect some disruptions if you're exploring that area.

Long-term mega-projects like the Downtown Rail Extension and BART expansion are always rumbling beneath us, and the Van Ness Improvement Project is still doing its thing. These are more about general city navigation than specific trail hazards, but hey, it's San Francisco. Something's always being built, broken, or rerouted.
