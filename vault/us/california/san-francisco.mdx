Today's a mixed bag for hitting the pavement, so choose your route wisely and maybe skip that PR attempt.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **AQI's a bit spicy**: At 86 with ozone as the dominant pollutant, those of you with sensitive respiratory systems might feel it. It's not "stay indoors, apocalypse now" bad, but it's not ideal for all-out sprints either.
*   **Construction season is always in full swing**: Ongoing road and parking closures around Fort Mason, and down on Howard Street, mean you'll likely encounter detours. Plan your routes, or get ready to improvise.
*   **Weather's a dream**: Clear skies and a cool 15.2°C (about 59°F) with a light breeze means your muscles and joints will be happy, assuming you don't trip over a construction barrier.

Alright, San Francisco, let's talk about getting out there without ending up in my physical therapy office.

First off, the good news: the weather is absolutely primo for a run or a solid outdoor sweat session. That 15-degree Celsius, clear sky situation? That's what we live for. Your joints are going to thank you for not making them slog through a cold, wet mess or bake in an unexpected heatwave. So, from a purely orthopedic perspective, today is *chef's kiss*.

However, and there's always a "however" in this city, your lungs might not be quite as thrilled. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 86, with ozone playing the starring role. For most of us, it's probably not going to be a deal-breaker, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally grumpy airways, you might want to dial back the intensity. Maybe save that interval training for a day when the air isn't quite so... zesty. Don't be a hero and push through chest tightness; that's just stupid.

Now, let's get to the real San Francisco special: perpetual construction. If your usual loop takes you anywhere near **Upper Fort Mason**, be aware that roads and parking areas are undergoing utilities and seismic retrofit projects, leading to closures that are expected to last all the way through Fall 2026. This isn't a new development, but it means you can't just cruise in there expecting business as usual. Either reroute or embrace the unexpected obstacle course. Same goes for parts of Howard Street between The Embarcadero and 4th Street, where the Transbay Howard Streetscape Project is creating a two-way bike lane and other upgrades, causing intermittent delays and lane closures during weekdays. So, if you're planning an Embarcadero-adjacent run, keep an eye out for signs and construction crews.

**Watch Your Step & Your Car:** Speaking of parks, always be vigilant about vehicle break-ins at park parking lots and scenic overlooks. Don't leave anything valuable in your car, no matter how quick you think your workout will be. San Francisco car thieves don't care about your PRs.

Also, late-night or early-morning runners need to be aware of the ongoing bridge rehabilitation work. There are ramp closures on I-80 and US-101 happening weeknights until February 27th, and Bay Bridge on-ramp closures continuing through tomorrow morning. While these are primarily for vehicle traffic, it speaks to the general state of roadwork, and if you're navigating urban routes, unexpected detours or residual traffic from these closures could impact your journey.

Pollen's low, so at least your sneezes won't be interrupting your strides. Just remember, a "clear" day doesn't always mean "clear" air for everyone. Listen to your body, navigate the urban jungle, and don't assume every path you know is open.
