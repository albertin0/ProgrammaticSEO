Today's a mixed bag for hitting the pavement in Roseville; the air's okay, but you might be playing dodge-the-fog and navigating detours.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI of 83 with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't terrible, but it's not "crisp mountain air" either. If your lungs are finicky, or you're planning a seriously intense session, keep an eye on how you feel. It's generally acceptable for most, but sensitive folks might experience minor symptoms.
*   **Morning Fog:** Don't be surprised if your early run or ride feels like you've stumbled into a pea-souper. There's a dense fog advisory for the Sacramento Valley through Thursday morning, which means visibility could drop faster than a dropped gel pack.
*   **Trail Construction is Still a Thing:** Good luck finding a trail in Roseville that *isn't* under some form of construction. Specifically, the **Dry Creek Greenway East** trail, from Darling Way to Rocky Ridge Drive, is in its first phase and estimated for completion sometime this year. Expect ongoing work and potential reroutes.

## The Rundown

Alright, Roseville, let's talk about what you're actually dealing with today. We've got clear skies and a comfortable 14.4°C (that's about 58°F for you Fahrenheit fundamentalists), which sounds pretty nice on paper. Low pollen is a win for anyone who usually sneezes their way through spring.

However, the air quality is sitting at a "moderate" 83 AQI, with ozone being the primary troublemaker. This isn't a "stay inside and hermetically seal your house" level, but if you've got asthma or any other respiratory issues, you'll want to be mindful. Maybe dial back the pace slightly, especially during peak afternoon hours when ozone tends to be higher. Your lungs will thank you.

### Foggy Mornings & Trail Headaches

My biggest gripe for early birds today is that potential for dense fog. You might think you're getting an atmospheric, mysterious run in, but really, you're just risking a run-in with a curb or another runner. Visibility could be seriously low, so if you're out before the sun burns it off, layer up with reflective gear and don't assume drivers can see you.

And then there's the perennial Roseville trail construction. The City of Roseville's official page from January 13, 2026, claims "no scheduled closures," but also warns about seasonal flooding and unexpected detours. More importantly, the **Dry Creek Greenway East** project is well underway. They've been working on this bad boy since early 2024, and it's expected to continue through 2026, with recent news (February 11, 2026) confirming more funding and ongoing work, including erosion repairs near Linda Creek. So, if your usual loop involves parts of Dry Creek Greenway, be prepared for sections to be closed or detours to be in place. It's always a good idea to check the city's parks and trails updates before you head out, because "no scheduled closures" doesn't always mean "no closures at all."

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Air Quality Advisory:** With AQI at 83 due to ozone, sensitive groups (children, older adults, and those with heart or lung disease) should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. It's not horrible, but it's not pristine either.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Dense Fog Alert:** If you're out before late morning, expect patchy to dense fog. Wear bright colors, use lights, and proceed with caution, especially near roads or crosswalks. Drive carefully if you're heading to a trailhead.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Check for Trail Detours:** Before you lace up for a long run on any of Roseville's greenways, especially the Dry Creek Greenway East, check the City of Roseville's parks and trails updates for unexpected closures or construction detours. Don't assume your usual route is clear.

Basically, it's a "go for it, but don't be a dummy" kind of day.
