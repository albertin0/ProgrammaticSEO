Look, if you're not going to listen to your body, at least listen to me: today's a solid *maybe* for a full outdoor send, especially if your lungs are already complaining.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality index (AQI) is clocking in at 78, with "inhalable particulate matter" being the star of the show. That's not terrible, but it's enough to make some people feel it.
*   Weather-wise, you're golden. Clear skies and a very comfortable 14.8°C (that's pushing 59°F for the Fahrenheit fanatics). Absolutely perfect running weather, no complaints there.
*   Pollen count is blissfully low, so your nose and eyes should be spared the usual seasonal torture.

## Today's Vibe: Treadmill or Trail?

Alright, Roseville, let's talk real. We've got pretty sweet running weather right now – that 14.8°C and clear sky combo is what dreams are made of for a spring run. But before you lace up and hit the Miners Ravine Trail for your usual killer pace, there's a little asterisk next to that "perfect" rating.

The Air Quality Index is hanging out at 78, which for some might feel okay, but for others, especially those with any kind of respiratory issues, it's definitely something to consider. The dominant pollutant, inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), isn't exactly lung candy. Think of it as tiny invisible irritants trying to crash your workout party. While WeatherBug calls anything from 60-79 AQI "Low" for general population, they *do* advise that "People with lung disease, such as asthma, children, older adults, and outdoor workers should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion." So, if you fall into one of those categories, or you just woke up feeling a bit congested, maybe scale back the intensity or opt for an indoor session. Your lungs will thank you.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Alert:** With the AQI at 78 and inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, sensitive groups (asthmatics, kids, older adults) should probably dial back any prolonged or heavy outdoor workouts. It's not a full-blown "stay inside" day, but don't push it if you feel any irritation.

Good news on other fronts: there haven't been any recent local news reports about trail closures due to wildfires, flooding, or major construction in the last 24 hours that would significantly impact your run today. The City of Roseville's own trail closure page even noted "no scheduled closures" as of January 2026, though they always remind us about seasonal flooding in low-lying areas. Current stream levels are also showing as "Normal" which is a relief after some of the winter deluges we've seen. Wind is light, barely a whisper, so no fighting a headwind the entire way.

So, if your lungs are feeling strong, go for it. Enjoy that crisp, clear air and the low pollen count. But if you're on the fence, err on the side of caution. There's always tomorrow, or the gym.

**Pro Tip:** Even though stream levels are normal, always exercise caution if running near Dry Creek or Pleasant Grove Creek after any rain, as conditions can change quickly. The City of Roseville maintains an online tool to check current stream levels.
