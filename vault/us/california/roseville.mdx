It's a "treadmill inside with the windows open, maybe hit the weight room" kind of day, not an "epic PR attempt on the trails" day.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh, Again:** We're sitting at an AQI of 81 with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. That's "Moderate," folks. Translation: your lungs might feel it, especially if you've got any underlying respiratory issues. It's not "stay indoors and panic" level, but it's certainly not "breathe deep and feel invigorated" either. The air is "moderately polluted," exceeding the WHO's annual limit for long-term exposure, so don't make a habit of pushing it on days like this.
*   **Trail Closures & Detours Are Your New Best Friends:** If you were planning on a peaceful run or ride on the **Miner's Ravine Trail**, think again. Resurfacing work is actively happening, which means temporary closures and heavy equipment making their way through during weekday hours (7:30 a.m. – 5:30 p.m.). Same goes for sections of the Pleasant Grove Creek Trail and the Foothills Trail due to ongoing construction and PG&E work. You'll be rerouting more than you're actually running if you stick to the usual spots.
*   **Weather's a Dream, But Don't Be Fooled:** The clear skies and a comfortable 17.9°C (around 64°F) are deceptive. It's prime weather for a fantastic workout, but the air and trail conditions are going to put a damper on your plans, or at least force some adjustments.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step on Detours:** With parts of Miner's Ravine Trail and Pleasant Grove Creek Trail closed for construction and resurfacing, you'll be on detours. These temporary routes might have uneven surfaces, road crossings, or increased vehicle traffic. Pay attention, keep your head up, and ditch the headphones if you're navigating new terrain. A twisted ankle or an unexpected encounter with a truck is a surefire way to ruin your day, and probably your next few weeks.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Consider Indoor Options or Shorter Runs:** Given the moderate air quality, especially the particulate matter, today might be a good day to hit the gym, do some cross-training, or stick to a shorter, less intense outdoor session. If you insist on hitting the pavement, try sticking to less trafficked neighborhood streets where you might get a bit cleaner air than next to a busy road. Don't forget that long-term exposure to moderately polluted air isn't doing your cardiovascular system any favors, even if you feel fine in the moment.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Stay Out of Standing Water:** While the active flood warning isn't directly for Roseville, we all know our local trails, especially those in low-lying areas, can get swamped after any significant rain. The City's own advice is clear: "Never enter an area that's under water." What looks like a shallow puddle can hide debris, sharp objects, or a much deeper current. Turn around, find another way, or just accept that the trail isn't runnable today.
