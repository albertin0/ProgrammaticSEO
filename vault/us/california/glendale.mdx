If you're looking to crush a new PR today, you might want to rethink your outdoor plans, Glendale.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   Pollen is practically trying to choke you out there with "Very High" levels, making every breath a fight, especially for us allergy sufferers.
*   That "Moderate" AQI with inhalable particulate matter isn't doing your lungs any favors, either.
*   Some of our favorite mountain escape routes, like parts of the Angeles National Forest near Mt. Baldy, are still locked down due to ongoing closures, so forget those long ascents.
</BulletList>

Look, the 24.7°C and clear skies might *look* inviting, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a perfect day for a grueling outdoor session. We've got layers of environmental nonsense to deal with before you even consider hitting the pavement or the trails.

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

| Pollutant Type                 | Level       | AQI/Impact                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------------- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inhalable Particulate Matter   | Moderate    | AQI of 54. Generally acceptable, but sensitive groups may experience minor to moderate symptoms.              |
| Ash and Alder Pollen           | Very High   | Expect increasing pollen levels, making outdoor exertion difficult for those with allergies or respiratory issues. |

### Trail Closures in Nearby Mountains
Heads up to all you mountain goats: Several popular trails in the Angeles National Forest, including stretches of the Mt. Baldy Trail and Devil's Backbone Trail, are under an extended closure until the end of today, February 26th. This isn't just a suggestion; it's for public safety, likely due to recent conditions. Don't be "that guy" who ignores the warnings and needs a rescue. There are also ongoing closures from the Eaton Fire Area that extend through 2027, so know before you go, especially if you're venturing beyond our local Verdugo Mountains.

### Brand Park Teahouse Under Renovation
If your workout involves a stroll through Brand Park, be aware that the historic Teahouse is undergoing minor repairs and structural improvements until early March. The garden itself is open, but the porch areas are closed, which might impact your post-run cool-down spot. Plus, there's always local construction to navigate around the city streets.

### Hydrate, You Animals!
Even with the "moderate" temperatures, you're still in Southern California. That pollen is going to dry you out, and an AQI of 54 still means some junk in the air. Keep that water bottle glued to your hand, especially if you insist on pushing it today. Your lungs and joints will thank you later.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, if you're not absolutely desperate for an outdoor fix, maybe hit the gym or stick to some light stretching today. Your respiratory system will appreciate not having to filter what feels like a forest fire's worth of pollen while simultaneously dodging street construction.
