Another beautiful, slightly hazy day in Anaheim means you can probably get your miles in, but don't expect perfectly crisp air or uninterrupted trail runs.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   That "moderate" AQI isn't just a number; 67 with inhalable particulate matter means your lungs are working a little harder than they should be, especially if you're pushing the pace.
*   The weather itself is pretty sweet for February, hovering around 19 degrees Celsius and clear. No excuses about the cold or rain here.
*   Watch your step on the Santa Ana River Trail – parts are still undergoing maintenance. Don't assume your usual route is clear sailing.

Look, I know we all love to brag about our "perfect Southern California weather," but let's be real. Today, February 26, 2026, is a classic Anaheim day: mostly good, with a few hidden sneezes and detours. The temperate 19.2°C and clear skies are great for getting outside, no complaints there. Your joints will thank you for avoiding the extremes.

However, let's talk about those lungs. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "moderate" 67, and the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter. That’s the kind of stuff you really don't want to be sucking deep into your airways when you're hitting max effort. It's not "stay indoors and panic" bad, but it's definitely "consider taking it down a notch" territory, especially if you've got any underlying respiratory issues. Think of it as running with a very, very mild resistance band around your chest. Not ideal.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory: Particulate Matter Present**
With an AQI of 67 driven by inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), individuals sensitive to air pollution should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. Even for the rest of us, it's a good day for steady-state cardio, not interval sprints. Listen to your body.

Pollen, at least according to the data, is thankfully low today. So, if you're usually a walking allergy attack, you might get a reprieve on that front. Just don't get too comfortable; this is Southern California, the land of year-round sniffles.

Now, for those of you who hit the **Santa Ana River Trail** regularly, heads up. OC Public Works is still doing maintenance repairs along sections of the trail between Weir Canyon Road/La Palma Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. This project has been ongoing since early January and runs through the end of February. That means you might encounter closures, detours, or uneven surfaces. Nothing ruins a tempo run like having to navigate an unexpected construction zone, or worse, roll an ankle on a patched-up section. Plan your route, or be ready to improvise.

**Trail Alert: Santa Ana River Trail Maintenance**
Expect potential detours and uneven surfaces on the Santa Ana River Trail between Weir Canyon Road/La Palma Avenue and Lincoln Avenue due to ongoing maintenance. Keep your eyes open and consider an alternate route if you're aiming for uninterrupted miles.

There aren't any major weather warnings for Anaheim today, no massive events blocking entire districts for runners, and thankfully, no recent reports of trail-destroying floods or wildfires directly impacting our running spots. It’s a pretty average, if slightly dusty, Thursday.

So, get out there. The air quality isn't perfect, and you might need to reroute on the river trail, but otherwise, it's a solid day for a workout. Just don't forget your water, and maybe skip breaking any PRs on your lung capacity today.
