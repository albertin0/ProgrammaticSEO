Looks like a decent day for a run if you're smart about it, but Anaheim's still got its usual hurdles to jump.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
-   Air quality is sitting firmly in the "meh" zone, thanks to ozone.
-   Construction is still a constant companion, especially near major hubs and our beloved trails.
-   The sun's out and temps are rising, so don't be a hero, hydrate.

### Environmental Breakdown

| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- | :---------------- | :-------- |

### Today's Rundown

Alright, Anaheim, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the dirt today. First off, the good news: pollen is low, so your sinuses can probably chill out for once. The weather is clear and a balmy 24.3°C (that's 76°F for you Fahrenheit folks). It's prime shorts and t-shirt weather, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a free pass. That sun will sneak up on you, so plan your hydration like it's a critical race strategy.

Now for the not-so-great news. Our air quality is hanging around an AQI of 71, with ozone being the main culprit. That's "Moderate," which means for most of us, it's probably fine. But if you've got asthma, sensitive lungs, or you're pushing really hard, you might feel it. Don't go setting any PRs if you're feeling sluggish. Listen to your body – it's usually smarter than your ego.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Ozone Levels
The AQI is 71 due to ozone. If you're sensitive to air pollution or plan on a high-intensity workout, consider moving it indoors or adjusting your effort. Keep an eye on any shortness of breath or unusual fatigue.
</AlertBox>

Here's the real kicker: construction. It's Anaheim, so are we ever *not* under construction? It looks like there's ongoing maintenance and repairs along sections of the **Santa Ana River Trail** between Weir Canyon Road/La Palma Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. If you're planning your long run or a leisurely bike ride along that stretch, expect detours, narrow paths, or even temporary closures. Don't be that person who ignores the signs and nearly gets run over by a backhoe. Seriously, those guys are just trying to do their job. Always respect construction zones, even if it means altering your usual route.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Santa Ana River Trail Maintenance
Heads up, trail runners and cyclists! OC Public Works is performing maintenance repairs along the Santa Ana River Trail between Weir Canyon Road/La Palma Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. This could mean significant disruptions, closures, and potential hazards. Find an alternate route or be extremely vigilant if you choose to go through.
</AlertBox>

Beyond the trails, if you're sticking to the streets around the Disneyland area, be aware that construction at **Harbor Boulevard and Disney Way** is causing "significant delays" and potential headaches for pedestrians and bus routes. If your workout takes you through that tourist-heavy corridor, plan extra time and keep your head on a swivel. Tourists and construction zones are a chaotic mix, and you don't want to become part of someone's vacation anecdote about that crazy runner.

### Stay Hydrated & Visible
With clear skies and warm temperatures, make sure you're drinking enough water before, during, and after your workout. If you're out near any construction or busy areas, especially as evening approaches, wear bright colors or reflective gear.
</AlertBox>

So, can you work out outside today? Yeah, absolutely. Just go in with your eyes open, a bottle of water in hand, and a willingness to adjust your plans if you hit a construction snag. It's not perfect, but it's far from the worst we've seen.
