Alright, Anaheim, let's talk about hitting the trails today. While the sun's out, don't let those clear skies fool you entirely; there are a few things to consider before you lace up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>

*   **Air Quality is a Mixed Bag:** Your lungs might feel it, especially if you're sensitive. AQI is hovering in that "moderate" to "unhealthy for sensitive groups" territory.
*   **Pollen's Not Playing Nice:** Despite what some charts might tell you, we're looking at a medium-high pollen count, particularly for those ash and alder allergies.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** While not directly on the running paths, expect some major traffic headaches around the 91 Freeway at Lakeview Avenue, impacting how you get to your favorite spots.

</BulletList>

## The Daily Grind: What to Expect Out There

### Air Quality Check

The good news is the temps are fantastic at 20.5°C (that's about 69°F), with clear skies, which sounds like perfect running weather. However, the air quality data we're seeing for Anaheim today, February 28, 2026, shows an AQI of 60, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. This pushes us into the "moderate" category for most, but it’s definitely "unhealthy for sensitive groups". If you've got any respiratory issues, you might want to scale back that long run or consider an indoor alternative. AccuWeather specifically flags 55 AQI as a "high level of pollution" for sensitive individuals.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Air Quality Alert: Sensitive Groups Beware!**
With an AQI of 60, the air quality is considered moderate but unhealthy for sensitive groups due to particulate matter. If you have asthma, allergies, or other respiratory conditions, minimize prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion today.
</AlertBox>

### Pollen Report

While some data might suggest low pollen, other sources are flagging a medium-high pollen index, particularly for Ash and Alder. If you're usually battling seasonal sniffles, expect today to be a bit rough.

| Pollen Type | Level (Anaheim) |
| :---------- | :-------------- |
| Trees       | Medium-High     |
| Grass       | None            |
| Weeds       | None            |

*(Note: Data on pollen levels can sometimes vary. Err on the side of caution if you're an allergy sufferer.)*

### Navigating Local Obstacles

Now, let's talk about getting around, especially if you're driving to hit up the Santa Ana River Trail or similar spots. The 91 Freeway is undergoing some serious work. There are significant 55-hour ramp and lane closures at Lakeview Avenue, which started Friday night and run through Monday morning, March 2. This includes the westbound 91 onramp at Lakeview and lanes on the Lakeview overpass. This isn't directly closing trails, but it *will* make your commute a nightmare if you're trying to get to running routes in that vicinity. Plan your routes to avoid Lakeview entirely if possible.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Zone Ahead: 91 Freeway at Lakeview Avenue**
Expect major delays and potential detours around the 91 Freeway and Lakeview Avenue due to ongoing construction until Monday morning, March 2. Plan alternate routes if you typically access running areas via this interchange.
</AlertBox>

### General Safety: Always Be Aware

While no specific, *new* incidents have been reported in the last 24 hours regarding runner safety, it's always a good time for a reminder. We all remember the tragic incident in December where eight Anaheim High School runners were struck by a suspected drunk driver while waiting at an intersection. It's a stark reminder that even when you're doing everything right, you need to stay vigilant.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Street Smarts for Runners**
When running on sidewalks or near roads, always stay alert. Avoid distractions like headphones that block out ambient sound. Cross at designated crosswalks, make eye contact with drivers, and assume they don't see you. Your safety is paramount.
</AlertBox>

In short, it's a nice day temperature-wise, but keep an eye on that air quality and pollen, and definitely factor in the freeway construction if you're traveling far for your workout.
