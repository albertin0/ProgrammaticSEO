Alright, Anaheim, today's a mixed bag. You might escape the rain, but you won't escape that lovely SoCal air quality if you're sensitive.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Sketchy:** While the city's official AQI might float around "Moderate," AccuWeather is calling our air quality "Poor" today and explicitly stating it's "unhealthy for sensitive groups." The dominant pollutant is Ozone, which means your lungs might not love that long run, especially if you're prone to respiratory issues. Don't just shrug it off.
*   **Santa Ana River Trail Hustle:** For those planning to hit the Santa Ana River Trail, be prepared for some shenanigans. OC Public Works is still doing remedial repairs between Weir Canyon Road/La Palma Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. This is supposed to wrap up *this month*, but today's still fair game for flag personnel, reroutes, and having to walk your bike around construction zones. It's a pain, but better than riding into a ditch.
*   **Weather's Playing Nice (Mostly):** Temperatures are starting off mild, around 13-17°C (55-62°F) this morning, and will climb to a pleasant 27°C (81°F) this afternoon. Expect partly cloudy skies, not completely clear, but definitely no rain to wash away the ozone. If you're out later, don't forget your shades and some sunscreen – that SoCal sun still burns.

### **Bad Air Day for Some of Us**
Seriously, if you're in a sensitive group – asthma, respiratory issues, or just a seasoned runner who feels it in your lungs – consider scaling back your outdoor intensity or taking it inside today. A "Poor" AQI isn't a suggestion; it's a warning. Ozone is no joke.

### **Santa Ana River Trail Construction Zone Navigation**
If you're using the Santa Ana River Trail today, especially the section between Weir Canyon Rd and Lincoln Ave, keep your eyes peeled. There will be active work zones. Slow down, follow any flagger directions, and be ready to dismount and walk if the path is too narrow or obstructed. Don't be that person who ignores the signs and causes a scene.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### **Road Running: The Eternal Hazard**
Look, I'm not saying don't run on the roads, but always, always be hyper-aware. We had that horrific incident in December where Anaheim High School runners were hit by a suspected DUI driver at Harbor Boulevard and North Street. That wasn't some remote trail; that was a city street. Don't run with headphones on both ears, make eye contact with drivers, and assume every car hasn't seen you. Your life depends on it.
