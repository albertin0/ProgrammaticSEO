Alright, Anaheim. Today's the day you can actually get out there without immediately regretting every life choice that led you to outdoor exercise.

<LungsJointsScore score={8} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lungs:** AQI is looking fantastic at 40, and the provided pollen data says "Low." No excuses on that front.
*   **Joints:** Weather's a solid 21.4°C and clear. Perfect for getting those miles in without baking or freezing.
*   **Hazards:** Just because the sky is clear, don't forget we've had some recent *powerful* winds. A tree literally fell at Disneyland late Tuesday night, injuring folks. That means checking for downed branches and debris, especially on more exposed routes, isn't a bad idea.
</BulletList>

### Local Trail Conditions

Good news for the lungs, but if you're hitting the **Santa Ana River Trail** near Orangewood Avenue, get ready for a detour. The bridge widening project there is still in full swing, and it includes "bike trail reconstruction." Don't expect a smooth ride or run through that specific section. Always scope out your route beforehand if you're planning a long one, because Orange County Public Works isn't always quick with their "trail closed" signage.

### Today's Pollen Breakdown

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up on Construction:** Beyond the Santa Ana River Trail, there's ongoing construction at the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Disney Way, causing transit delays. If your workout takes you near the tourist core, be aware of increased vehicle traffic and potential sidewalk closures.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Road Running Reminder:** While not a "hazard" for today specifically, remember that December incident where eight Anaheim High School runners were hit by a suspected drunk driver at Harbor Boulevard and North Street? It's a brutal reminder to stay vigilant out there, especially if you're sharing the road. Wear bright colors, stay alert, and assume drivers aren't paying attention.
