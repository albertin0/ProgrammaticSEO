It's an absolutely miserable day to work out outside if you care about your lungs or want to hit the trails around Ontario. Just stay home, folks.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

## Why today is *not* the day

<BulletList>
*   **Unseasonably Hot & Dangerous:** Seriously, what is this, June? Temperatures are hitting the high 80s, possibly even 90°F. That's heat stroke territory if you're not careful, especially when pushing yourself.
*   **Your Lungs Will Hate You:** The Air Quality Index is sitting at a solid 51, which is "Poor" and means it's unhealthy for sensitive groups. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), which loves to get deep into your lungs and cause trouble. This isn't just a "sniffle" kind of bad; it's a "feel it in your chest" kind of bad.
*   **Popular Trails Are Closed:** If you were eyeing a tough hike up to Ontario Peak or anywhere in the Mount Baldy area, forget it. Those trails are under a temporary closure, extended until March 20th. There's still significant snow on the higher elevations, making conditions dicey even if they *were* open. Don't be that person who ignores closures and needs rescuing.

## The Full Breakdown

Let's be blunt: the weather gods are playing a cruel trick on us this late February. While the skies are clear, the mercury is soaring. Expect highs in the mid-to-high 80s today, potentially even touching 90 degrees in some parts of Ontario. That's not ideal running weather, even for seasoned desert dwellers. Hydration isn't just a suggestion, it's a survival strategy.

And speaking of survival, let's talk about the air. Your lungs are getting a double whammy today. First, the heat makes your body work harder just to exist, let alone exercise. Second, our Air Quality Index is firmly in the "Poor" category at 51. The main culprit? Inhalable particulate matter, the kind of tiny crud that sensitive groups will absolutely feel. If you have asthma, allergies, or just generally enjoy not hacking up a lung, seriously reconsider that outdoor run. Running in "Poor" air quality is like actively choosing to filter bad air through your most important breathing muscles.

Pollen, at least, is low, so that's one less thing to worry about for allergy sufferers.

### Ontario's Ongoing Construction Woes

You might think you can just stick to city streets, but even there, we've got issues. The city is a constant construction zone, with major projects like the new parking structures around the Civic Center and the massive Grand Park at Ontario Ranch breaking ground or ongoing. The Ontario Regional Sports Complex near Whispering Lakes golf course is also under construction, expected to be completed this spring. What does this mean for your workout? More dust, more localized traffic, and potential detours on sidewalks and bike paths. That dust certainly doesn't help our already "Poor" AQI with its particulate matter.

#### Mount Baldy Trails are CLOSED!
Do NOT attempt to hike in the Mount Baldy area today, including routes to Ontario Peak or through Icehouse Canyon. These trails are explicitly closed until March 20, 2026, for public safety. Ignoring these closures isn't just dangerous for you due to lingering snow, it puts our already stretched first responders at risk. Stay off the mountain.

#### Heat Advisory for Your Run
With temperatures pushing into the high 80s and even 90°F, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are real risks. If you *must* run outside, go early, go short, and hydrate like your life depends on it (because it kind of does). This is not the day for PRs.

#### Find an Indoor Option
Seriously, this is a perfect day for the treadmill, a spin class, or anything indoors. Or, you know, a couch and a good book. Your body will thank you.
