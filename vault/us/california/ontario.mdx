Alright, Ontario, time to talk about hitting the streets or trails. Today isn't the worst, but it's not a golden ticket either.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering in the moderate zone with ozone as our dominant pollutant, so your lungs might notice it more than usual.
*   Temperatures are looking pretty comfortable at 16.5°C, rising to a pleasant 27°C later, so your joints will appreciate the warmth.
*   Pollen is *reported* as low, which is a win for seasonal allergy sufferers, but keep an eye out as other local forecasts indicated medium-high levels yesterday.

## The Rundown for February 26, 2026

So, you're looking at a generally clear day here in Ontario, which is always a bonus when you're trying to get a sweat on. The temperature is spot-on for an outdoor workout, not too hot, not too cold. It’s the kind of day where you can actually enjoy the sunshine without feeling like you're melting into the asphalt on Euclid Avenue.

However, let's get real about the air. An AQI of 61 with ozone leading the charge isn't terrible, but it's not pristine mountain air either. If you've got any respiratory sensitivities, you might want to consider dialing back the intensity a notch or sticking to an indoor setup, maybe at the 24 Hour Fitness on Fourth Street, if you're sensitive. Think of it as giving your lungs a slightly easier shift.

Now, about that pollen. The official word is "Low," and we'll take that for what it is. But a quick peek at yesterday's local forecasts hinted at medium-high pollen with ash and alder being the culprits. This is Ontario, folks; sometimes the air just *feels* dusty even when the numbers say otherwise. If you’re prone to allergies, maybe don’t leave your Zyrtec at home just yet.

### Trail Talk: Tread Carefully

If your go-to is the gorgeous Pacific Electric Trail, especially the sections around Upland heading towards Claremont, be aware. Recent reports, even from a few days ago, mentioned mud, debris, and those infamous thorns after the rains. Nothing will kill your running zen faster than a flat tire or a sprained ankle because you weren't watching your step. And let's be honest, getting around that stretch in Fontana with the construction detour on Seville Avenue is a minor annoyance, but still something to factor in.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Heads Up for Mountain Runners!** A temporary closure for trails in the Mount Baldy (Mount San Antonio) area of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument is still in effect through today, February 26, for public safety. Don't make the drive up there only to be turned around. Always check the Angeles National Forest alerts before heading to higher elevations.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert (Mild):** While the AQI is "moderate," if you're pushing hard, particularly during the hotter parts of the afternoon when ozone levels tend to peak, you might feel some irritation. Consider early morning or later evening workouts to minimize exposure.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Local Pollen Check:** Even with a "low" reading, conditions can vary block by block, especially with those pesky ash and alder trees around. If your nose starts running, don't assume the data is wrong; just assume Ontario is doing its thing.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level (Ambee) | Local Outlook (Yesterday) |
| :---------- | :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Overall     | Low           | Medium-High (Ash, Alder)  |

Ultimately, it’s a decent day to get out there, but keep your wits about you. Listen to your body, check those trail conditions, and don't push it if the air feels off. Your lungs and joints will thank you.
