Today is a mixed bag for outdoor workouts in Honolulu; the clear skies are inviting, but ocean conditions and city street events demand caution.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Challenging Ocean Conditions:** A High Surf Advisory for east-facing shores means strong currents and dangerous breaking waves are a real threat. Seriously, stay out of the water today.
*   **Gusty Trade Winds:** Moderate trade winds with gusts up to 20 mph will make exposed coastal runs and higher elevation activities a bit of a grind.
*   **City Obstacles:** Expect traffic detours and potential disruptions if your route takes you through downtown due to the Onipa'a Peace March.

## The Nitty-Gritty: What's Really Going On Out There

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news on the pollen front – it's low, so your sinuses should get a break today.

### Air Quality (AQI: 66, Dominant Pollutant: Ozone)

The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 66, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While it's not "unhealthy," it's definitely not ideal. If you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel this during sustained, high-intensity efforts. Just something to keep in mind, especially if you're pushing hard.

### Weather & Winds

It's a clear, comfortable 21.7°C (71°F) out there, heading for a high of 79°F. Perfect running weather, right? Almost. The trade winds are in full effect, blowing from the east-northeast at around 15 mph, with gusts kicking up to 20 mph. This means that while you'll get a nice breeze, you'll also be fighting a headwind at times, especially on exposed stretches like those along **Ala Moana Beach Park** or if you're hitting the ridges.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**High Surf Advisory!** If you're thinking about ocean swimming, surfing, or even just hanging out on east-facing beaches, reconsider. There's a High Surf Advisory in effect through 6 p.m. today due to elevated swells and strong currents. Lifeguards may close beaches. Just yesterday, a swimmer had to be rescued from the waters near **Halona Blowhole**, emphasizing how dangerous conditions can be. Don't be that person.

### City Commotion & Construction

Beyond the natural elements, Honolulu's urban landscape presents its own set of "hazards."

<AlertBox type="info">
**Downtown March Alert:** If your workout route usually takes you through the heart of town, be aware that the Onipa'a Peace March 2026 is happening today. It starts at Mauna Ala and will impact streets like Nuuanu Avenue, Beretania Street, Richards Street, and South King Street, ending at **Iolani Palace**. Lane closures begin at 8:30 a.m., so plan your runs or rides accordingly, unless you want to be part of the crowd.
</AlertBox>

Construction is a perennial feature of our city, and today's no different. Expect ongoing right shoulder closures on the H-1 Freeway westbound for the H-1 Widening project. Also, watch for lane closures on the eastbound H-1 Freeway between Nuuanu Avenue and Pali Highway from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. for tree trimming. The Honolulu Rail Transit Project is also still chugging along, with foundation work on Nimitz Highway. These can mean unexpected detours or reduced shoulder space for runners and cyclists, so stay vigilant.
