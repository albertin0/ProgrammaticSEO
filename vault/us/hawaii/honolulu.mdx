Okay, Honolulu. Clear skies and comfortable temps make it tempting to hit the pavement today, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There are always caveats, and today's no different.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why Today Is (Mostly) The Day (But Still Be Smart)

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is officially "Moderate" with ozone playing the dominant role. If you're prone to lung irritation, you might feel this one a bit. Don't push it.</li>
  <li>Pollen levels are thankfully low, so at least your sneezes won't derail your run, unless it's from breathing in exhaust.</li>
  <li>Speaking of exhaust, construction crews are out in force. Expect delays and detours, especially on major routes.</li>
</BulletList>

The sun's out, the temperature is a pleasant 21.9°C (that's about 71°F for those still stuck in Fahrenheit land), and there's not a cloud in sight. Seems ideal, right? Well, almost.

### Air Quality: Keep an Eye on That Ozone

While the air might *look* clear, our AQI is clocking in at 66, which puts us squarely in the "Moderate" category. The culprit? Ozone. For most of you, this means it's generally acceptable for outdoor activity, but if you've got asthma or any other respiratory issues, you might notice some irritation, especially if you're pushing a hard interval session. Don't be a hero; listen to your body. The highest AQI in the last 24 hours hit 65 around 9 AM, so it's not a new development today. The State of Hawaii Department of Health's Clean Air Branch is always monitoring this stuff, so it's good to know someone's watching.

### Construction Chaos: Mind Your Route

Our beloved roads are, as usual, a construction zone. If you're planning on running along or near major arteries, prepare for diversions. For instance, **Kalanianaole Highway** is seeing single-lane closures for things like HECO work and sign maintenance through Thursday. This means narrowed shoulders and potential for more traffic. Same goes for parts of Nimitz Highway with HART work causing 24/7 closures between Awa Street and Richards Street all the way through November 2026. If your route takes you anywhere near these areas, plan for extra time or find an alternate path that doesn't involve dodging cones and construction vehicles.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Ozone Alert:** With an AQI of 66 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, individuals with respiratory sensitivities should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Your lungs will thank you.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Coastal Waters Warning:** While Honolulu's immediate shores aren't under the most severe warnings, the National Weather Service in Honolulu reported high surf advisories for north and east-facing shores of *most islands* today due to a fading north-northeast swell. Surf is expected to drop by evening, but strong breaking waves and currents still make ocean activities dangerous on these exposed coasts. When in doubt, stay out of the water.

  **Traffic & Detour Tip:** Check the Hawaii Department of Transportation website before heading out for the latest lane closures. Don't assume your usual path is clear. Patience is key.
