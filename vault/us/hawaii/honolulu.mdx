Alright, Honolulu, you want to know if you should actually get out there today? Honestly, it's not half bad for February, but don't go thinking it's perfect.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hitting "Moderate" levels thanks to ozone. Your lungs might notice it, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   Construction around spots like Kamehameha Highway and Dillingham Boulevard is still a thing. Expect detours and less-than-ideal running surfaces if you're hitting those areas.
*   While the weather itself is clear and a pleasant 22.1°C, the North and East shores are seeing elevated surf that's above advisory levels. If you're planning a beach run, watch those waves.
</BulletList>

### Don't Be a Hero, Check the Air

Look, a 66 AQI isn't going to kill you, but that "Ozone" tag means it's the kind of pollution that messes with your respiratory system. If you've got asthma or any other lung issues, today might be a good day for an indoor spin class or some laps at the Kaimuki YMCA pool instead of pushing it on a long run around Kapiolani Park. We live in paradise, but that doesn't mean our air is always pristine. Your lungs work hard enough without adding extra stress from ground-level ozone.

### Mind the Grind: Construction Chaos Continues

If your route takes you anywhere near the ongoing rail project, especially sections of Kamehameha Highway or Dillingham Boulevard, be ready for a headache. These projects are a permanent fixture right now, and while the major traffic adjustments for the City Center Guideway and Stations project are *officially* kicking off in March, you know the prep work and daily disruptions are already in full swing. Watch for uneven pavement, sudden lane shifts for pedestrians, and general urban chaos. It's not a deal-breaker, but it means you need to be more aware than usual. Don't be that runner glued to their phone, blindly jogging into a trench.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Coastal Caution for Water Lovers & Beach Runners:** The north and east facing shores are still seeing elevated surf. While it's expected to fade later, today is *not* the day to be cavalier about ocean conditions if your workout involves the water or the immediate shoreline. Strong currents can be a real problem, even for experienced ocean-goers.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Good News on the Pollen Front:** At least the tree pollen isn't out to get you today. Levels are low, so if seasonal sniffles are usually your nemesis, you're getting a pass on that front. Enjoy it while it lasts.
</AlertBox>

So, yeah, you *can* go outside, but be smart about it. Pick your routes wisely, be extra vigilant with the traffic and construction zones, and listen to your body, especially those lungs. Don't let the beautiful weather fool you into ignoring the subtle hazards.
