Alright, Baltimore, it's a "proceed with caution, maybe stick to the beaten path" kind of day.

<BulletList>
*   That recent winter storm? Yeah, it's gone, but its icy, slushy ghost might still be lurking on unplowed trails and shaded sidewalks, especially if temps drop tonight. Don't get complacent just because the sun's out now.
*   Air quality is officially "Moderate" thanks to ozone, so your lungs might not be singing opera, but they're not exactly in a mosh pit either.
*   Construction around the Inner Harbor and on major arteries like the Hanover Street Bridge means you'll be dodging more than just slow walkers. Watch your step.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The sun's out, the sky's clear, and it feels like spring is finally trying to peek through this endless winter-that-wasn't-quite-winter. But don't let the pretty facade fool you. Maryland, in general, just got walloped by a winter storm, and while the city proper might not have seen the 7-11 inches the Eastern Shore did, "hazardous road conditions" were reported statewide as recently as February 25. That means a very real chance of black ice, slush puddles ready to swallow your ankle, and general debris on those lesser-trafficked routes.

If you're heading out for a run, maybe reconsider that serene stretch of the Gwynns Falls Trail that never quite gets sunlight, or those less-maintained paths in the county parks. You're better off sticking to well-cleared sidewalks or the main drag of the Inner Harbor promenade – though even there, be aware of ongoing "Inner Harbor Crosswalks and Bicycle Wayfinding Enhancements" under construction. And good luck getting anywhere smoothly near the Hanover Street Bridge; that repair and resurfacing project is set to make things interesting all year.

As for what you're breathing in:

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

The pollen count is low, so sneeze away, allergies aren't your main concern today. However, the Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 69, with ozone being the primary pollutant. This isn't red-alert territory, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel it on longer, harder efforts. Think of it as a subtle background hum of irritation, not a full-blown siren.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** Despite the clear skies, lingering ice or slush from the recent storm could still be present, especially in shaded areas or on less-trafficked paths. A 9.2°C day can lead to melting, which then refreezes overnight if temperatures drop. Be mindful of slippery surfaces.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
Consider a treadmill run today if you're worried about uneven footing, or stick to major, well-maintained city streets. If you're running downtown, expect detours and potential bottlenecks around construction zones like those near the Inner Harbor.
</AlertBox>

The bottom line: It's not the worst day to run, but it's far from perfect. If you're going out, be smart, be visible, and prioritize footing over hitting that PR. Your joints will thank you later.
