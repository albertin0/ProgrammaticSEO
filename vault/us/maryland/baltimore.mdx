Alright, Baltimore, don't let the sunshine fool you this morning; today is a tale of two different workout days, and the second half is a real mess.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   Enjoy that morning chill – it's the best you're getting.
*   Serious winds and heavy rain are rolling in by late afternoon, so ditch those evening plans to run the promenade.
*   AQI is hovering at "moderate," meaning if you've got sensitive lungs, today might not be your PR day anyway.

## Today's Weather & Air: A Grim Forecast for the Evening

Look, if you're out there before noon, the crisp air and clear skies are pretty decent for a run along the Jones Falls Trail. The temperature is a cool 4.6°C (about 40°F), which is brisk but runnable. Your lungs won't be thrilled with the "moderate" AQI of 55, dominated by fine particulate matter, but it's not going to kill you unless you're already wheezing.

But let's be brutally honest: this morning's peace is just the calm before the storm. The National Weather Service is calling for some genuinely hazardous conditions to hit our region starting late this afternoon, specifically between 5 PM and 10 PM EST. We're talking a strong frontal system bringing heavy, intense rainfall for several hours, combined with high easterly winds. Those gusts could hit 50 MPH inland and a terrifying 60-70 MPH closer to the Chesapeake Bay.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**DANGER AHEAD: Evening Weather is NO JOKE!**
From 5 PM to 10 PM EST today, expect heavy rain, high winds up to 70 MPH near the Bay, and significant tidal flooding, especially around the Inner Harbor. Small streams and creeks could also flood due to saturated soils. Stay indoors!
</AlertBox>

This isn't just a "get a little wet" kind of rain; we're looking at potential flooding of small streams and creeks, especially with the ground already saturated. More importantly for us city dwellers, the combination of heavy rain and those fierce onshore winds means **moderate-to-major tidal flooding** for areas along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, including our beloved **Inner Harbor**. Don't even think about trying to "power through" that. It's not worth getting knocked over by a rogue gust or wading through murky, possibly contaminated floodwaters.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction & Closures (Minor Impact for Workouts)**
While there aren't specific trail closures from the last 24 hours directly impacting most major Baltimore running routes, remember that construction is ongoing across Baltimore County. For example, parts of Falls Road are seeing water main replacements, with potential lane closures even during the day. Always keep an eye out for unexpected detours on your routes.

## Pollen Breakdown

Good news for allergy sufferers, if you ignore everything else.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Ragweed     | Low   |

Overall, today's a split decision. Get your workout in early if you absolutely must be outside, but once that clock ticks past 4 PM, lace up your slippers, not your running shoes. Seriously, don't mess with 70 MPH winds and floodwaters. Your PR can wait.
