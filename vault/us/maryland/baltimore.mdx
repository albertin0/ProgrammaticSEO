Alright, Baltimore, let's talk about hitting the pavement today. If you're looking for a perfect, unhindered run, you're not getting it, but it's far from the worst.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering in that "moderate" zone, which means some of you with sensitive lungs might feel it.
*   Expect some showers to roll through later today, so your clear morning might not last for an afternoon stroll.
*   Downtown is a mess with event and construction closures, so plan your urban routes carefully.
</BulletList>

### Lungs: Moderate, Not Great, Not Terrible

Your lungs aren't going to be thrilled, but they're not staging a full-on revolt. Our AQI is sitting at 60, with "Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm)" being the dominant guest in the air party. That's "moderate," which sounds benign enough, but if you've got any kind of respiratory issues, take it easy, especially with prolonged, heavy exertion. You're not going to see any "Code Orange" alerts today like that nasty June day last year with the wildfire smoke, thank god. Pollen is mercifully low, so at least your nose won't be staging its own protest.

### Joints: Mind the Puddles and the Detours

The temperature is a pretty decent 9.4°C (around 49°F), which is fantastic for late February in Baltimore. Your joints should be happy with that. However, the forecast says "clear" but also warns of "showers developing in Maryland Thursday before spring-like weekend." So, while your morning might be dry, be ready for some wet patches or outright rain if you're out later. The good news is, we're not dealing with any lingering heavy snow or blizzards like the one that hit us a few days ago, which closed some Eastern Shore schools. So, no black ice surprises, probably.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Downtown Baltimore is a Labyrinth of Closures Today.** If your usual route takes you anywhere near the CFG Bank Arena or through the heart of the city, rethink it. We've got numerous lane closures on Baltimore Street, Eutaw Street, Guilford Avenue, Howard Street, Lombard Street, and Pratt Street, mostly between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. This isn't just a minor inconvenience; it's a full-on "where the hell do I go?" situation for runners and cyclists. Plus, the CIAA Basketball Tournament is in town, so expect heavier-than-usual traffic around that whole area well into the evening.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Overnight Tunnel Closures:** The southbound I-895 Baltimore Harbor Tunnel is shutting down tonight at 9 p.m. for maintenance, reopening at 3 a.m. If you're a night owl runner or commute through there, be aware of the two-way operations in the northbound tunnel.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Tree        | Low     |
| Grass       | Low     |
| Ragweed     | Low     |

Overall, it's a mixed bag. The air isn't sparkling, the roads are a mess if you're urban, but the temperature is cooperative, and your allergies should be chilling. Get out there, but keep your head on a swivel and maybe stick to the less congested parks if you can.
