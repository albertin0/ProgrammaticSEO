Today's a "get out there, but keep your head on a swivel" kind of day in Baltimore.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **AQI's a bit hazy:** While pollen is low, we're sitting at a moderate 69 AQI with inhalable particulate matter as the main culprit. That's not terrible, but it's not pristine, either, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   **Sneaky ice is a B****:** Remember that nor'easter that dumped snow and ice on us just a few days ago? Even with temps hitting a balmy 10.1C, shaded spots, bridges, and less-trafficked pathways (looking at you, back trails around Lake Montebello) can still be hiding black ice. Don't be that runner with a broken wrist.
*   **Construction's still a thing:** Baltimore's always building something, and right now, there's ongoing water main work on Falls Road, and scattered lane closures are still a possibility. Keep an eye out for cones and uneven surfaces, especially if you're trying to set a PR on your commute route.

## The Full Breakdown

### Air Quality Report
The air quality index is currently at 69, which falls into the moderate category. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), which basically means tiny bits of crud floating around that your lungs aren't thrilled about. While it's not hitting "stay indoors" levels, if you're prone to respiratory issues, or if you're planning a lung-busting sprint session, you might feel it. Take it easy, consider an easier route, or even opt for that indoor track you keep forgetting about. The good news? Pollen levels are blessedly low today.

| Pollutant Type       | Level    |
| :------------------- | :------- |
| General AQI          | 69       |
| Dominant Pollutant   | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) |
| Tree Pollen          | Low      |
| Grass Pollen         | Low      |
| Weed Pollen          | Low      |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory:** An AQI of 69 with particulate matter isn't great for sensitive groups or prolonged, intense outdoor activity. Pay attention to your breathing and consider scaling back.

### Weather & Ground Conditions
It's a clear day at 10.1 degrees Celsius, which sounds lovely on paper. But let's be real, Baltimore. We just got hammered with a winter storm. While the major snow from Sunday and Monday is mostly gone, the freeze-thaw cycle is the perfect recipe for black ice. This is especially true on bridges, overpasses, and those shaded stretches of path that never see the sun, like certain sections of the Jones Falls Trail. Remember that ice often forms first and lasts longest on elevated surfaces and in damp, shady spots. Assume it's there, especially in the morning or evening.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Black Ice Hazard!** Despite clear skies and above-freezing temps, recent winter weather means black ice is a significant, hidden risk on roads, bridges, and trails. Watch your step, especially on the Falls Road overpasses or shaded spots.

### Local Obstacles & Construction
Construction around Baltimore County is still ongoing. For instance, there's significant water main replacement happening on Falls Road between the city line and Brightfield Road, which might still involve lane closures during the day, even if the project is 99% complete. Be aware of your surroundings and any sudden traffic pattern changes if your route takes you through these areas. While Baltimore County's website states "no reported road closures" *currently*, local projects can pop up or have lingering effects. The major Harborplace redevelopment isn't kicking off until fall 2026, so no issues there today.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Heads Up on Your Route:** If you're running near ongoing construction, like the lingering water main work on Falls Road, be mindful of equipment, uneven surfaces, and potential lane shifts. Stay visible and stay alert.
