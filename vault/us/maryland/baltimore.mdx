Alright, Baltimore, you can get out there today, but maybe keep your downtown sprint plans on ice and bundle up a bit.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   It's a clear day, which is always a plus, even if it's freezing. No lingering snow drifts on your favorite trails like the Baltimore and Annapolis Trail, at least as of a few days ago.
*   Your lungs won't hate you thanks to low pollen and a 'Moderate' AQI, but don't push it if you're sensitive to fine particulate matter.
*   Traffic downtown is going to be a real mess later, so if your route takes you near the Inner Harbor, be warned.

## Today's Vitals

| Pollutant Type | Level    |

## What's Out There

The air quality is sitting at a "Moderate" AQI of 61, with fine particulate matter being the main culprit. This means for most of us hardy runners, it's business as usual. However, if you're one of those folks with asthma, heart issues, or just perpetually sniffly lungs, you might feel it. The Maryland Department of the Environment has historically issued "Code Orange" alerts when things get worse, advising sensitive groups to reduce strenuous outdoor activity. We're not quite there today, thankfully, but it's something to keep in mind, especially with that "fine particulate matter" hanging around.

<AlertBox type="info">
Remember, "Moderate" AQI isn't a free pass if your body usually complains. Listen to it. Maybe dial back that tempo run to an easy jog if you're feeling it in your chest.

Weather-wise, it's a crisp 0.7°C (33°F) out there, feeling more like -1°C (30°F) when you factor in the wind, even though it's clear. While Baltimore isn't under any extreme cold warnings today, that's still cold enough to make your joints ache if you don't warm up properly. Forecast says we'll warm up to a relatively balmy 15°C (59°F) later in the day, but don't count on that for your early morning miles.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Layer up! And don't skimp on the gloves or a good hat. Your body needs to maintain its core temperature, and those extremities are often the first to suffer. Cold muscles are tight muscles, and tight muscles are injured muscles.

Now for the real pain in the ass today: downtown traffic. It's Saturday, February 28, 2026, and the CIAA Basketball Tournament is still in full swing at the CFG Bank Arena. This means the Baltimore City Department of Transportation has some lovely "traffic modifications" planned, which is code for "good luck getting around." Expect lane closures and general chaos from 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. in the vicinity of the arena. This includes stretches of Howard Street, Lombard Street, Baltimore Street, and, yes, even **Pratt Street** near the Inner Harbor. If you usually run this area, you'll be dodging more than just slow tourists.

<AlertBox type="danger">
Avoid downtown running routes, especially near the CFG Bank Arena, after 3 PM today. Seriously. Unless you enjoy sharing your run with frustrated drivers and event-goers, find an alternate route.
</AlertBox>

Some good news: While a nor'easter did dump some snow recently (February 22nd), the Baltimore and Annapolis Trail was reported clear of snow and ice as of February 18th, and today's clear weather means most main paths should be fine. Just watch out for any residual icy patches in shaded areas, especially early this morning.

*Data grounded with WBFF and Weather Underground from February 28, 2026.*
