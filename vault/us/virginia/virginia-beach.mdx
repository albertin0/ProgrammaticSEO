Honestly, today's not terrible for a February run, but don't expect pristine conditions.

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is creeping up, folks. 77 with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't terrible, but it's not "crisp mountain air" either. You'll feel it if you're pushing serious mileage.
*   Temperatures are mild, bordering on pleasant for February, but that wind coming off the ocean, even if not "high," can still be a chilly kick in the face. Dress in layers.
*   Pollen is low, which is a rare win for Virginia Beach. Enjoy it while it lasts before spring decides to unleash its full floral fury.

## The Rundown: Breathe Easy? Sort Of.

Alright, Virginia Beach, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the dirt today, February 26th. The good news is we're not dealing with any major weather catastrophes. No blizzards, no hurricanes, no flash floods turning Shore Drive into a river. The bad news? We're still breathing air, and while the AQI of 77 isn't a "stay inside and hermetically seal your house" level, it’s not exactly ideal for an all-out effort, especially if you’ve got sensitive lungs or are prone to hitting the wall. That dominant ozone pollutant can be a sneaky lung irritant.

### The Ozone Omen & Other Annoyances

So, ozone. You know, that stuff that's good up high and bad down low? Yeah, it's making a bit of an appearance today. If you're planning on hammering out intervals on the Virginia Beach Boardwalk or pushing a long run through First Landing State Park, keep an eye on how you feel. Don't be a hero. A 7.9°C (about 46°F) day sounds lovely, but when you're sucking in that slightly-off air quality, it can make an otherwise decent temperature feel heavier.

I haven't seen any alerts about massive construction blocking the trails or any rogue wildfires turning our skies orange in the last 24 hours, so that's a small victory. No major event seems to be gumming up the works either, which means your usual routes should be clear.

<AlertBox type="warning">
That AQI of 77 with ozone as the dominant pollutant means you might experience some respiratory irritation, especially during intense or prolonged activity. If you're new to running, have asthma, or are just feeling a bit off, consider dialing back the intensity today. You're not going to set a PR with an ozone hangover.

<AlertBox type="info">
Layer up! While 7.9°C isn't freezing, the air can still feel damp and chilly, especially with any residual breeze coming off the Atlantic. A light jacket or long-sleeved shirt you can shed is smarter than freezing through the first mile. And seriously, a hat or ear band. Your ears will thank you.
