It's a "mostly good, but don't be a dummy" kind of day to get your miles in, Virginia Beach.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The wind is still trying to kick your ass, especially near the ocean. February in VB is always a breezy affair, and today's no exception, even if it feels clear.</li>
  <li>Don't be surprised by lingering puddles or full-on shallow floods, particularly near tidal waterways. A coastal flood advisory *just* lifted, so low-lying areas are likely still soggy.</li>
  <li>Construction closures, specifically around 17th Street, mean you'll need to reroute. Plan ahead or embrace the urban obstacle course.</li>
</BulletList>

The weather app says "clear" and 9.5°C (49°F), which sounds lovely, right? Don't let that fool you into thinking it's smooth sailing. We're still firmly in the "windy conditions" part of our February weather cycle. While we're not talking about the 40-54 mph gusts that slammed the Oceanfront earlier this month, you can bet your ass there's still a decent chop to the air, especially if you're out near the sand. That kind of wind can turn a pleasant run into a fight, taxing your lungs and making every stride feel harder than it should.

**Pollen Breakdown**

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Good news for your allergies: pollen is low today. Breathe easy on that front.

**Air Quality Report**

Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a moderate 60, with fine particulate matter being the dominant pollutant. This isn't a red alert, but if you've got asthma or any other respiratory shenanigans going on, pay attention. It means there are tiny airborne particles that can irritate your lungs, especially during sustained exertion. Listen to your body; if you feel it, ease up.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### Watch Out for Residual Flooding
  Remember that coastal flood advisory that wrapped up just a couple of days ago? That means areas near the shoreline and tidal waterways are still likely dealing with shallow inundation. Don't be a hero trying to splash through standing water on the trails or roads. Not only is it nasty, but you can't see what's underneath. Parts of South Independence Boulevard, for example, have a history of staying flooded after decent rainfall. Stick to higher ground, or at least familiar routes you know drain well.

### Construction Zone Headaches

Our city is constantly building something, which is great for the future, but a pain for your run. Right now, there are several road closures to contend with. The ever-present work on 17th Street between Pacific and Arctic Avenues is ongoing, and Winston Salem Avenue is also closed to through traffic for utility work until March. Even Indian River Road has lane closures you might encounter. If your usual route takes you through these areas, be prepared for detours. It’s not a bad idea to scout your path before you head out, especially if you're hitting the pavement in the resort area.

  ### Layer Up and Stay Visible
  With that brisk air and potential wind chill, even 49 degrees can feel colder. Dress in layers you can shed as you warm up. And since daylight is still relatively short this time of year, especially if you're out early or late, make sure you've got reflective gear and lights. Construction zones are no place to blend in with the scenery.
