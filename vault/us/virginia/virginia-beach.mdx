Today's a mixed bag for outdoor workouts, Virginia Beach.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is flirting with "Moderate" today, mostly thanks to fine particulate matter. Your lungs might feel it more than usual, so don't push the pace if you're sensitive.
*   It's a brisk 4.1°C (around 39°F) and clear, which means cold muscles and joints if you don't warm up properly. Don't be a hero; get those dynamic stretches in.
*   Construction around the city continues its relentless march, so expect detours and watch your step.

## Your Daily Run-Down: February 28, 2026

Alright, Virginia Beach, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the trails today. The good news for all you sniffle-prone folks is that pollen is at a lovely "Low" level. Take a deep breath. Just maybe not *too* deep, because the air quality isn't exactly pristine.

Your AQI is clocking in at 77, with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. That pushes us firmly into the "Moderate" category. For most of you, a moderate AQI might just mean a slightly less peppy stride, but if you've got any respiratory issues, or you're planning a seriously intense, long-distance effort, consider dialing it back or sticking to some indoor options. There's no medal for getting an asthma attack on your Saturday long run.

### Moderate Air Quality Alert
With an AQI of 77 and fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, those with respiratory sensitivities or planning high-intensity workouts should exercise caution. Listen to your body and consider adjusting your routine.
</AlertBox>

Weather-wise, it's clear but chilly at 4.1°C. Perfect for layering up, but remember what cold does to your body. Muscles are tighter, joints are stiffer. Before you even think about tackling the **Shore Drive** sidewalks or any of the bike paths, spend some real time warming up. We're talking dynamic stretches, light jogging, getting that blood flowing. Ignoring it is just an express ticket to a pulled hamstring or a cranky knee. Nobody wants to hobble through Sunday.

### Local Hazards & Hot Spots

Now, for the usual Virginia Beach obstacle course. While there are no new severe weather warnings or advisories for flooding or high winds impacting today, construction is a perennial favorite around here.

**Shore Drive Phase III** is still a beast. You're looking at ongoing lane closures, particularly at night, but expect median demolition to continue through the winter between Sea Shell Road and West Great Road, which means potential daytime lane closures and shifting traffic patterns. If your route takes you through there, be aware.

**Indian River Road** is also getting some love, with utility work causing lane closures in both directions between Macdonald Road and S Military Highway. You might find additional outside lanes closed during the day (9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Saturday), and repairs to the Speed Fentress Bridge are scheduled from March 9-30, 2026, so expect impacts.

And let's not forget **Winston Salem Avenue**, which is closed to through traffic for utility work through March 2026.

### Construction Zone Navigation
Ongoing construction across Virginia Beach, including on Shore Drive and Indian River Road, means you need to be extra vigilant. Look for signage, expect lane shifts, and be prepared for potential detours. Plan your routes accordingly, especially if you're on a bike or running.

Stay safe out there, Virginia Beach. Don't be that person who ignores the warnings and ends up calling me, your friendly neighborhood PT, because you rolled an ankle in a construction ditch.
