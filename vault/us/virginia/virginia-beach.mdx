Today's a "get it done before the rain starts" kind of day, Virginia Beach, so hit the pavement while you can.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering in the "moderate" zone, nothing to panic about, but certainly not crystal clear. Your lungs will notice the fine particulate matter if you're pushing hard.
*   Construction around the Oceanfront, particularly near 17th Street, is still a hot mess. Plan your routes to avoid unexpected detours or getting tangled up with heavy equipment.
*   While it's currently clear, the forecast is screaming rain later today, so don't dawdle unless you enjoy a good soaking.

## Virginia Beach Workout Report: February 26, 2026

Alright, Virginia Beach, it's Thursday, February 26th, and if you're looking to log some miles, you've got a window, but it's not perfect. We're sitting at a cool 8.4°C (about 47°F) with clear skies *right now*. That's decent for a run if you layer up, but don't get too comfortable. The weather models are all pointing to rain rolling in later this afternoon, with a near 100% chance of precipitation for the day. So, if you're planning a lunchtime jog or an evening long run, be ready to get wet or hit the treadmill.

### Air Quality & Allergies: Breathe Easy, Mostly

Good news for the sniffly crowd: pollen levels are low. You shouldn't be battling allergy attacks while trying to set a new PR on the Cape Henry Trail today.

However, the air quality isn't exactly pristine. We're sitting at an AQI of 63, which falls into the "Moderate" category. The dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter. What does that mean for your lungs? It means if you're sensitive, or if you're pushing a really high-intensity workout, you might feel it a bit more than usual. It's not "stay indoors" bad, but it's not "fresh mountain air" good either. If you have any respiratory issues, consider dialing back the intensity or opting for an indoor session.

### Roadblocks and Detours: The Usual VB Shuffle

Construction is the eternal hazard in Virginia Beach, and today's no different. If your usual route takes you anywhere near the Oceanfront, be advised that 17th Street between Pacific and Arctic Avenues is closed, and Arctic Avenue north of 17th Street is also shut down for extended periods. This isn't a new development, but it's a persistent headache for runners trying to navigate that area. Expect detours and restricted access if you're trying to cut through. Same goes for those of you trying to get around Great Neck Road or Indian River Road, which are both seeing lane closures due to ongoing utility work. These aren't trail closures, but they affect how you get to your starting point or might force you onto busier roads.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch for Wet Roads!** While it's clear now, a high chance of rain is forecast for later today. Wet roads mean reduced traction and potentially slick surfaces, especially around storm drains or painted lines.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for Success (and for Change):** With temperatures in the high 40s Fahrenheit and the strong possibility of rain, layers are your friend. A light, waterproof outer shell wouldn't hurt, and make sure your shoes have decent tread.
</AlertBox>

No crazy high winds or extreme cold to worry about today, and thankfully, no reports of wildfires or significant flooding. Just that moderate air, some pesky construction, and the looming threat of rain. Get out there early if you want to stay dry.
