Alright, Virginia Beach, let's talk about hitting the pavement today. It's technically clear out there, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's smooth sailing.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "Moderate" AQI with fine particulate matter isn't exactly a green light for your lungs, especially if you're already huffing and puffing.
*   Construction around the Oceanfront is a constant, frustrating obstacle course, and it's particularly bad right now.
*   While the recent coastal flood advisory has expired, low-lying areas near the water are still a gamble.

## The Rundown

Look, the sun's out, and the temperature's a brisk 7.8°C (around 46°F), which isn't terrible if you layer up properly. However, don't ignore that AQI reading of 71. "Moderate" means there's enough fine particulate matter floating around to irritate anyone with respiratory sensitivities, and honestly, none of us need extra crud in our lungs when we're trying to push it. Might not see it, but it's there.

Speaking of things you *will* see, the city's still a construction zone, especially if your usual routes take you anywhere near the water. The **17th Street/Virginia Beach Boulevard Improvements project** is in full swing, meaning 17th Street between Pacific and Arctic Avenues is closed down, along with sections of Arctic Avenue itself. This isn't just a minor detour; it's a full-on headache if you're trying to navigate the resort area on foot or bike. And let's not forget the massive Atlantic Park redevelopment at the old Dome site, which is essentially a permanent construction site right near the oceanfront. If you're planning a long run down the Boardwalk, be ready for bottlenecks, heavy equipment, and a general lack of serene running space.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Oceanfront Obstacles Ahead:** The 17th Street/Virginia Beach Boulevard Improvements, Atlantic Park redevelopment, and Rudee Park projects mean significant road closures and construction zones. Expect detours and less-than-ideal running conditions around the Oceanfront and ViBe Creative District.

Pollen, at least, is playing nice today with a "Low" rating. So your sniffles probably aren't coming from blooming trees, more likely from that fine particulate matter if you're feeling it.

For those of you who venture further afield, remember that February in Virginia Beach can be pretty damp and windy overall, even if today is clear. We also had a Coastal Flood Advisory just a few days ago (Feb 22-23) for low-lying areas. While that's passed, our coastal neighborhoods are always susceptible. If your route includes paths near tidal waterways or areas that notoriously hold water, exercise caution. It doesn't take much to hide a pothole under a shallow puddle, and twisting an ankle isn't anyone's idea of a good workout.

**Dress for the Unexpected:** Clear skies don't mean balmy. With temperatures hovering around 7.8°C, layers are your friend. A brisk wind can make it feel much colder, so consider a windbreaker.
