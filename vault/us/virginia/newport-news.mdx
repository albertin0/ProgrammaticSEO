Today? If you like dodging traffic and a crisp chill, sure, get out there. Otherwise, maybe rethink that long run.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  <li>**One City Marathon is NOT a suggestion:** Major road closures are happening all over the City Center/Oyster Point area for the Maritime 5K and other race events until at least 10:30 a.m. Don't be that person who ignores the cones.</li>
  <li>**Air's a bit hazy:** AQI is clocking in at 74, which is "Moderate," with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. If your lungs are sensitive, you'll feel this one, especially with that early morning chill.</li>
  <li>**It's brisk, but clearing up:** We're starting at a chilly 4°C (39°F) but it's supposed to warm up to a much more pleasant 14°C (57°F) with clear skies later. So, layer up, but know you can shed some gear.</li>

## The Full Rundown: Navigating Newport News Today

Alright, Newport News, let's talk about hitting the pavement today, February 28, 2026. My honest take? It's a mixed bag, and mostly because of human decisions, not just Mother Nature.

First, the good news for your allergies: pollen is low. So at least your nose won't be staging a rebellion while you're trying to breathe.

Now for the less-than-stellar stuff. The air quality isn't exactly pristine. We've got an AQI of 74, which means it's in the "Moderate" zone. The culprit? Fine particulate matter. This isn't just some abstract number; it means if you're out there pushing hard, especially if you have asthma or other respiratory issues, you're breathing in microscopic crud that can irritate your lungs. It’s not a full-blown red alert, but it's definitely a yellow light.

The weather itself is starting out cold, hovering around 4°C (39°F) this morning, but it's clear and expected to warm up to a pleasant 14°C (57°F) by the afternoon. This means layering is key. Start bundled, and peel off those layers as the sun does its job. Just be aware that patchy fog is predicted for tonight, so if your workout extends into the evening, visibility might drop.

### Local Hazards You Can't Ignore

**<AlertBox type="danger">
  **One City Marathon Road Closures are REAL.**
  Today is the Maritime 5K day for the One City Marathon weekend. That means full road closures are in effect for the City Center/Oyster Point areas from roughly 7:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Partial closures are also impacting Rock Landing Drive and nearby streets. If your usual route takes you anywhere near there, find an alternative. Seriously, the volunteers and police don't need your "but I just wanted to run" attitude. Plan ahead. Tomorrow, Sunday, March 1, will see even *more* significant, citywide closures for the full marathon.
</AlertBox>**

Beyond the race, don't forget the eternal state of Newport News: **construction**.
**<AlertBox type="warning">
  **I-64 Construction Continues.**
  Long-term lane closures and traffic shifts are still happening on I-64 at the J. Clyde Morris Boulevard overpass and near Hampton Roads Center Parkway. While you're probably not running on the interstate (I hope), this means getting to trails like the Noland Trail or Newport News Park might involve more traffic and delays than usual. Factor that into your travel time.
</AlertBox>**
And in case you were planning a peaceful jaunt by Lucas Creek Pump Station, be advised that HRSD is doing 24-hour pipe installation during weekdays, which can bring noise and bright light towers if you're out super early or late.

**<AlertBox type="info">
  **General Safety Reminder.**
  It's always smart to stay aware of your surroundings. Recent news has highlighted a concerning surge in gun violence this month, with multiple homicides reported across the city, including incidents near J. Clyde Morris Boulevard and Jefferson Avenue. Stick to well-trafficked areas, especially if you're out alone, and consider running with a buddy.
</AlertBox>**

So, go run, but don't be a hero. Respect the closures, be mindful of the air, dress for the temps, and stay safe out there.
