It's a solid day for a run, but don't get complacent just because the sun's out.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   That "Clear" sky is a bit deceiving; the AQI is nudging into the moderate zone, thanks to fine particulate matter. Your lungs might notice it if you're pushing hard.
*   The temperature is absolutely primo for getting outside. Not too hot, not too cold – just right for those mid-distance efforts.
*   Keep an eye on the ground though, especially if you're hitting any of the less-maintained sections around the Lafayette River Trail; after all the rain we've had this week, there could still be some slick spots or standing water off the main path.

## Today's Air & Allergies: Don't Let "Low" Fool You

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- |
| Low          | 60  | Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) |

Alright, "Low" pollen is basically a godsend for us seasonal sniffers, so go ahead and breathe easy on that front. No need to double-dose the antihistamines today.

However, that AQI of 60? That's creeping up. It's technically "Moderate," and while it's not going to instantly drop you to your knees, it's definitely enough fine particulate matter to be a minor irritant for anyone with sensitive lungs or if you're going for a really intense, long-duration workout. If you feel any tickle in your throat or shortness of breath beyond the usual "I'm running hard" kind, listen to your body. Maybe dial back the pace a touch, or cut your long run a little short. We’re talking about tiny particles here, the kind that sneak deep into your lungs. You won’t see them, but your body might feel them.

## Weather Watch: Perfect Temps, But Be Aware of What's Underfoot

We're looking at a fantastic 10.9°C (that's about 51.6°F for those of us who still use real measurements) and clear skies. Perfect running weather, honestly. Not too hot, not too cold. You can probably get away with a light long-sleeve or even just a short-sleeve once you warm up. No need for a jacket unless you're just walking around.

The real kicker today isn't the air or the sky, but what might be lingering from earlier in the week. We’ve had some decent rainfall, and while the main paved trails like the Elizabeth River Trail are probably fine, if you're venturing onto dirt or gravel, especially around areas like the Lake Whitehurst trails or any of the less-paved bits of the Lafayette River Trail near Norfolk Collegiate, expect some residual dampness, maybe even some standing puddles. Mud can be a joint killer, forcing your stabilizers to work overtime and setting you up for a twisted ankle if you're not careful.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Expect potentially slick or muddy patches on unpaved trails or low-lying areas, especially near water sources like the Lafayette River. Watch your footing.

## Local Alerts: Construction & Community Shenanigans

Good news for once: I haven't seen any major alerts for new construction blocking primary running routes, massive events shutting down entire parks, or any other usual Norfolk chaos in the last 24 hours. That's a win in my book. However, Norfolk is *always* under construction somewhere, so even without a specific alert, just keep your head on a swivel. Detours pop up without warning, especially downtown near Waterside or around the Ghent area. Don't assume your usual route is completely clear just because there wasn't a flashing headline. Always be ready to adapt.

<AlertBox type="info">
Remember to hydrate, even on cooler days. Low humidity and a moderate AQI still mean your body is working.
