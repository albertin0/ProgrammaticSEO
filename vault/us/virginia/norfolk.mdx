Alright, Norfolk, let's get real. Today is one of those days where you might regret not staying on the couch, but it's not a complete wash.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

### Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **AQI's a bit spicy.** We're sitting at a Moderate 77, with Ozone being the main offender. If your lungs usually complain, they'll definitely have something to say today. Not terrible for everyone, but don't push any personal bests.
*   **It's raining, folks.** Despite what some might hope, the current forecast for Norfolk is light rain throughout the day, with a 98% chance of precipitation. So much for "clear," huh? This makes for slicker surfaces and general damp misery, though the temperature is a mild 12°C (53°F).
*   **Construction is still a constant companion.** You can count on detours and general traffic headaches around the new Maury High School project and utility upgrades near Washington Park and Colonial Ave. Also, keep an eye out if your route takes you near Monroe Place, as there's a temporary road closure there for sewer work.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Air Quality

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 77, putting us squarely in the "Moderate" category. For most of us, this means it's generally acceptable for outdoor activity, but if you're part of a sensitive group – kids, older adults, or anyone with lung or heart issues – you might feel some minor to moderate symptoms, especially with prolonged exertion. The dominant pollutant is Ozone, which loves to mess with your respiratory system during outdoor workouts. Consider dialing back the intensity or shortening your run on the Elizabeth River Trail if you start feeling it.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Ragweed     | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are mercifully low across the board today. So at least that's one less thing to make your nose run while you're trying to breathe.

### Weather Conditions

While 12°C (53°F) is a pretty comfortable temperature for a workout, the persistent light rain and high chance of precipitation mean you'll be getting wet. The "clear" skies you might have heard about are nowhere to be found, so dress appropriately, and consider reflective gear if you're out near the roads. Historical data shows February in Norfolk can be quite damp, and today is certainly living up to that reputation.

### Watch Your Step: Wet Surfaces and Construction Ahead

With the rain, surfaces are going to be slick. Be extra careful on any boardwalks, metal grates, or painted lines on the road. The Elizabeth River Trail can get particularly greasy in spots. On top of that, ongoing construction around the Maury High School area means increased traffic, potential detours, and heavy machinery. Pay attention to signage, especially if you're running near Washington Park or Colonial Avenue. And yes, the sewer improvements on Monroe Place between Rockbridge Avenue and Magnolia Avenue are still closing off sections for through-traffic, impacting the Ghent area. Don't assume you can blaze through your usual path without interruption.

### Gear Up for the Drizzle

Grab a light, water-resistant jacket. Leave the earbuds at home, or at least keep the volume low, so you can hear traffic and any unexpected construction warnings. Visibility might be reduced, so bright colors are your friend. Remember, you're not made of sugar, but nobody likes soggy socks on a long run.
