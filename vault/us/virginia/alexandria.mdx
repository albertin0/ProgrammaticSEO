Today is one of those days where if you absolutely *have* to get outside, be smart, be prepared, and frankly, question your life choices a little.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   It's a chilly 1°C (34°F) out there with a wind chill that'll cut right through you, especially along the water. We've got a Gale Warning in effect for the Tidal Potomac River until 6 PM, meaning winds up to 35 knots, so expect to be fighting a headwind on half your run.
*   Watch your step! There are icy patches expected this morning on untreated surfaces like sidewalks, bridges, and overpasses. Nothing says "bad day" like a surprise slip on black ice near the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.
*   Air quality is moderate for Ozone, and while pollen is low, your lungs might still feel the burn from the cold, dry air and elevated pollutant levels.

### Today's Local Rundown: Don't Be a Hero, Be Smart

You know the drill, Alexandria. February sometimes gives us a taste of spring, and other times it reminds us we're still deep in winter's grip. Today, it's the latter, but with some extra spice.

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### Gale Warning on the Potomac!

Seriously, if you're planning a long run along the **Mount Vernon Trail** today, especially south of Old Town, brace yourself for some serious wind. A Gale Warning is in effect until 6 PM for the Tidal Potomac River with winds reaching 15-25 knots and gusts up to 35 knots. That's enough to knock you off your stride and make that 1°C feel like absolute zero. Bundle up, wear layers, and maybe opt for a route further inland if you hate fighting the wind.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Mind the Ice, Especially Early

With the temperature hovering around freezing, any lingering moisture from yesterday's almost-nothing-snow could turn into treacherous icy patches. This is particularly true on untreated bridges, overpasses, and shaded sections of trails. A fall on the **Holmes Run Trail**, which already has long-term closures and detours in effect due to past flooding damage, could really ruin your day. Stick to well-trafficked, well-lit areas if you're heading out this morning.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of the Mount Vernon Trail, if you *are* out there today, be aware that the "Potomac River Views 5k & 10k" event is happening. While it's great to see folks getting active, this means parts of the trail will be more crowded than usual. Be mindful of other runners and walkers, and if you're chasing a PR, maybe pick a different day or a less popular route.

<AlertBox type="info">
#### AQI & Cold Air Alert

Our Air Quality Index is currently 74, which is in the Moderate range, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. This, combined with the cold, dry air, means your lungs might take a beating. If you have asthma or other respiratory sensitivities, consider keeping your workout shorter, less intense, or indoors. And remember, the recreational water advisory for the Potomac River is still in effect due to sewage spills, so keep yourself (and any furry running buddies) out of the water.
</AlertBox>

Finally, while the extreme cold warning from earlier in the month isn't active, 1°C is still plenty cold to warrant proper winter running gear. Think layers, gloves, a hat, and something to cover your face if you're sensitive to cold air. Stay hydrated, even if it doesn't feel like you're sweating much.
