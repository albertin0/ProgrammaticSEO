Alright, Alexandria, shake off that morning chill and get out there if you dare. It's a surprisingly decent day to lace up, but don't let the clear skies fool you into thinking it's perfect.

<BulletList>
*   **That AQI is creeping up:** We're at a "moderate" 66, with nitrogen dioxide playing the starring role. That's enough to make your lungs take notice, especially if you're planning an intense session. Don't push your limits, particularly if you're sensitive.
*   **Chilly, but mostly clear:** At 5.7°C (around 42°F), it's brisk, but at least the sun *should* be making an appearance. Layer up, focus on a good warm-up, and you won't freeze your assets off.
*   **Construction season is always in season:** The Long Bridge Project continues its march through 2030, meaning ongoing rail construction. If your usual route involves the areas around **Alexandria Station**, expect potential noise and maybe some less-than-ideal detours or disruptions near the tracks. Keep an eye out.

You know the drill. Low pollen count is a win for anyone not wanting to sneeze their way through a run down the Mount Vernon Trail, but that AQI is a persistent buzzkill.

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

| Pollutant          | AQI |
| :----------------- | :-- |
| Nitrogen dioxide   | 66  |

<AlertBox type="warning">
That moderate AQI isn't going to kill you, but it's not ideal for maximum effort. If you find yourself wheezing more than usual or feeling a tickle in your throat, dial it back or opt for an indoor workout. Your lungs will thank you.

<AlertBox type="info">
With the temperature hovering around 5.7°C, dressing in layers is key. Start a little cold – seriously – because once you get moving, you'll warm up fast. A good base layer, a light mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell are your friends. Don't forget gloves and a hat, at least for the first mile or two.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
While there are no specific severe weather alerts for Alexandria today (Feb 26, 2026), forecasts for our general region can be fickle this time of year. Always check local radar before heading out; a "clear" morning can turn into "light rain" surprisingly fast. Slippery surfaces are no fun for anyone's joints.
</AlertBox>

Stay safe out there, Alexandria. Don't be a hero, just be smart.
