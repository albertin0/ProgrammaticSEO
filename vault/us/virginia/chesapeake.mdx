If you were banking on a clear, crisp run in Chesapeake today, well, Mother Nature apparently got a different memo than your general weather forecast. We're looking at rain, folks. Plan accordingly, or suffer the consequences.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Rain, rain, go away... or just get soaked:** Forget "Clear." Most local forecasts are calling for a nearly 100% chance of rain throughout the day. Your mileage may vary, but expect to get wet.
*   **Roads are a mess (more than usual):** Significant construction and lane closures on major arteries mean you'll be dodging more than just puddles.
*   **Moderate AQI, thanks Ozone:** It's not terrible, but sensitive lungs might feel it, especially with the added humidity from the rain.
</BulletList>

## Today's Chesapeake Grind: Rain, Ozone, and Cones. Lots of Cones.

Let's get real. The weather data I was given said "Clear," but every local forecast worth its salt *for today, February 26, 2026*, is screaming "Rain!". We're talking up to an inch of the wet stuff, potentially with some thunder. So, that planned run around Oak Grove Lake Park? Prepare for soggy shoes and slick pavement. The 12.2°C (54°F) temperature itself isn't bad for your joints, but rain drastically ups the risk of slips, especially on wet leaves or painted lines. Don't be that person I see in the clinic with a twisted ankle because you underestimated a puddle.

Speaking of things that will try to take you out, the air quality isn't exactly sparkling. Our AQI is hitting 77, with Ozone being the dominant jerk. That's "Moderate" territory, which means if your lungs are already finicky, you might feel a bit of irritation. Combine that with the humidity from the rain, and it's not ideal for pushing hard intervals. Take it easy on the breathing.

### Construction Chaos

If you're planning a road run or bike, good luck. Chesapeake's road crews are out in force. There are overnight mobile lane closures on the Chesapeake 168 Expressway until 5 AM for street sweeping. If you're an early bird, watch out for equipment. More significantly, Great Bridge Boulevard is undergoing manhole frame replacement between Bainbridge Boulevard and Lincoln Road, running from 7 AM to 5 PM today. Expect periodic lane closures and flaggers. This is going to be a nightmare for traffic, and an absolute hazard for anyone trying to run or cycle in that area. Stick to the sidewalks, and assume drivers aren't looking out for you. Another lane closure is happening on Rotunda Avenue near S Military Highway for guardrail repair from 9 AM to 3 PM. Just assume any road you want to run on has some form of impediment today.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Great Bridge Boulevard is a minefield today.** Avoid running or cycling on Great Bridge Boulevard between Bainbridge Boulevard and Lincoln Road due to manhole replacement and active lane closures. Seriously, your knees (and life) are worth more than proving a point.

On the bright side, no local wildfires are spewing smoke into our air, and fire danger is generally low. So at least you won't be coughing up ash. And if you're hitting trails like the Dismal Swamp Canal Trail, remember that even without recent rain-induced flooding, it's still a swamp. Keep an eye out for our slithery friends; copperheads are common and you don't want to step on one.

**Tip for the trails:** If you're out on the Dismal Swamp Canal Trail, even with no major events today, always be aware of your surroundings. Snakes are active in the warmer months, but even this time of year, it's good practice to watch your step.
