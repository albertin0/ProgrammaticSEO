Don't let the clear skies fool you, Chesapeake. Today's a decent day to get out there, but you'll be dodging more cones than squirrels if you're not careful.

<BulletList>
*   That mild 11.1°C (about 52°F) and clear weather? Chef's kiss for February. It's not often we get this kind of reprieve from the usual late-winter chill.
*   Pollen is playing nice, sitting at a mercifully low level. Your sinuses can breathe a sigh of relief, for once.
*   AQI is hovering around 62, putting us in the "Moderate" category due to fine particulate matter. It's not ideal, but it's far from a stay-inside-or-cough-up-a-lung situation. Just something to keep in mind if you're extra sensitive.
*   **Construction.** Oh, Chesapeake. We’re practically the cone capital of Virginia today. From new projects kicking off to long-haul endeavors, navigating our streets and bike lanes is going to be a workout in itself.

### On Your Run: Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive, and Dodge (Construction)

Look, the weather's saying "go for it," and your lungs are mostly on board. But your joints (and your sanity) might take a hit trying to navigate the current obstacle course our fine city has laid out.

**Great Bridge Boulevard** is getting a fresh dose of disruption starting today, February 26th. Manhole frame replacements are kicking off between the pump station west of the Bainbridge Boulevard intersection and Lincoln Road. That means periodic lane closures and flaggers from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. for the next week or two. If you usually weave through that area, expect delays, stop-and-go moments, and possibly some colorful language from frustrated drivers. This isn't exactly prime running territory at the best of times, but today it's a special kind of gauntlet.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Alert: Great Bridge Blvd is a mess today.** Expect lane closures and flaggers from 7 AM - 5 PM for manhole replacement. This isn't a minor annoyance; it's a full-on traffic headache that will impact pedestrian and cycling routes significantly. Consider alternate paths or times.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the ongoing saga. The **I-64 and I-464 interchange** is still a long-term construction zone with traffic shifts expected until summer 2026. While this mostly impacts drivers, if your route takes you anywhere near those major arteries, be extra vigilant for sudden changes in traffic patterns or debris. A recent fire at the construction site on February 14th was contained, but it's a reminder that these areas can be unpredictable.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip: Escape the Pavement Purgatory.** If you want to avoid the urban obstacle course, head for the **Dismal Swamp Canal Trail**. It's a straight shot, car-free, and offers a much-needed break from the city's perpetual construction. Just make sure you're layered up for the slightly cooler, open-air conditions out there.
</AlertBox>

Finally, today marks the *end* of a 24-hour consistent closure on **Executive Boulevard** near 1301 for the Belaire Road Extension Project. While the closure is technically lifting today, expect residual equipment, potential final touches, or unexpected changes as they wrap things up. Don't assume it's clear sailing just because the official end date is here.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Immediate Hazard: Watch out on Rotunda Ave.** There's a lane closure near S Military Hwy from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. today for guardrail repair. Flaggers will be present, but be aware if you're running or cycling through that stretch.
</AlertBox>

Overnight, from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., there will also be mobile lane closures on the **Chesapeake 168 Expressway** (northbound and southbound) for street sweeping. If you're a night owl runner or an early bird hitting the pavement before sunrise, keep an eye out for these moving closures and maintenance vehicles.

Overall, it's a good day to run from a pure weather perspective. Just be smart about *where* you run. Stay alert, watch for flaggers, and maybe choose a path less impacted by the city's eternal quest for infrastructure improvement.
