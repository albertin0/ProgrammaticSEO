Look, if you're thinking of a nice long run along the East Bay Bike Path today, you better be ready for some serious winter grit, because Providence is still digging itself out.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The city just went through a "historic snow event," with over three feet of accumulation, and despite the sun being out, recovery efforts are ongoing, which means sidewalks and secondary roads are still a mess.</li>
  <li>It's absolutely freezing out there at -7.3°C (that's about 19°F for those keeping score in freedom units), so exposed skin is going to suffer. Dress appropriately unless you enjoy frostbite.</li>
  <li>Don't expect clear sailing on all your usual routes; snow removal operations are still very much active, and some ramps are even temporarily closed for snow hauling.</li>

## Your Joints & Lungs: What to Expect Today

Today's a bit of a mixed bag, but mostly on the "stay inside unless you're truly dedicated" side. The air quality isn't terrible, sitting at an AQI of 76 with Nitrogen dioxide as the main culprit. That's moderate, so your lungs aren't going to be screaming about pollution. Pollen is low, which is a rare win for the allergy sufferers among us.

However, let's talk about the ground you'll be covering. Providence got absolutely buried a few days ago, and while Mayor Smiley announced the citywide parking ban is lifted as of 5 PM today, that doesn't magically melt 37 inches of snow. The city's been clear that snow removal is a "longer and more intense recovery" that will last for weeks. This means what looks like a clear road might have ridiculously high, icy snowbanks, and your favorite pedestrian routes? Forget about it. Property owners are *supposed* to shovel their sidewalks, but you know how that goes after a storm of this magnitude. Expect to be dodging icy patches, wading through slush, and possibly having to run in the street because the sidewalks are impassable.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ### Extreme Cold and Ice Hazards
  With temperatures hovering around -7°C, hypothermia and frostbite are real risks if you're not properly layered. Beyond that, the widespread snow from the recent "historic" storm means black ice and treacherous footing are lurking everywhere, especially in shaded areas or where meltwater has refrozen. Be extremely cautious, especially around corners and on unplowed paths.
</AlertBox>

### Local Headaches: Washington Bridge & Route 6
If you're anywhere near the Washington Bridge, brace yourself. The I-195 West bypass lanes from East Providence to Providence are still operating on the eastbound bridge, and they're calling for delays. Not ideal for a peaceful run. More directly impactful for runners, the on-ramps from Hartford Ave to Broadway Ave, Plaifield St, and Route 10 South are *closed today* until 2 PM for snow removal. So, if your usual loop involves any of those points, you'll be rerouting. Trying to hit up your usual spots near the **Michael S. Van Leesten Memorial Bridge** for a scenic run? Good luck navigating the icy approaches and snow mounds before you even get to the bridge deck.

  ### Layer Up, Seriously.
  This isn't just "chilly" weather; it's proper cold. Wear multiple layers, including a moisture-wicking base, an insulating middle layer, and a windproof/water-resistant outer layer. Don't forget a hat, gloves or mittens, and good wool socks. Exposed skin can get frostbitten in under 30 minutes in these conditions.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### Watch for Nitrogen Dioxide
  While the AQI is moderate, Nitrogen dioxide is the dominant pollutant. This usually comes from vehicle exhaust. Given the ongoing snow recovery means more trucks and plows on the road, try to stick to less trafficked areas if you can, or schedule your outdoor time for when traffic is lighter.
</AlertBox>

In short, today is for the truly dedicated or the treadmill warriors. If you're heading out, dress like you're going to Antarctica, assume every surface is secretly ice, and don't expect your usual clear paths. Providence is still a winter wonderland, which looks pretty but runs horribly.
