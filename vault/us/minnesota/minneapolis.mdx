Alright, Minneapolis, step outside, but keep your eyes peeled for detours and slick spots. It's a classic late-winter tease out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lungs:** Air quality is sitting pretty in the "moderate" zone at an AQI of 61. Nothing to write home about, but you won't be gasping for breath from pollution. Pollen is low, so your sinuses can relax.
*   **Joints:** We're finally above freezing at 1.4°C (34.5°F) with clear skies, which means your joints won't feel like they're grinding gravel. Enjoy the thaw while it lasts, because we know how fast things change around here.
*   **Hazards:** Major headaches for your usual routes. The Green Line Extension construction continues to swallow up popular paths, meaning detours are your new best friend on sections of the Cedar Lake Regional Trail and the Kenilworth Trail. Expect some rerouting and potential uneven surfaces.

</BulletList>

Look, the sun's out, the temperature isn't actively trying to freeze your eyelashes off, and the air is decent enough. That's a win in late February, right? But don't get too comfortable. This is Minnesota, after all.

## Today's Rundown: The Good, The Bad, and The Icy

The mercury might be teasing us with a breath of spring, but let's not pretend we're out of the woods. While the air quality is moderate and pollen counts are low, meaning your lungs get a relatively easy ride, your feet and ankles might have a different story.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail Closures are STILL a Thing
If your usual loop involves the **Cedar Lake Regional Trail** or the **Kenilworth Trail**, get ready for a change of scenery. Extensive closures are still in effect for the Southwest Light Rail Transit (Green Line Extension) project, forcing significant detours. Don't just show up expecting your usual path; check the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board's site for current maps or prepare for some creative route-finding. It's a long-term pain for runners, and it's not going away anytime soon.
</AlertBox>

While today's clear skies and above-freezing temps (hovering around 1.4°C or 34.5°F) are a welcome reprieve, remember that previous freeze-thaw cycles often leave behind insidious patches of black ice, especially in shaded areas or on less-traveled paths. Just because it *feels* mild doesn't mean you can slack on your footing. Look before you leap, or you'll be calling me for some PT advice you should've avoided.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch Your Step: Lingering Ice
Despite the mild temperature, be hyper-aware of icy spots. Shaded sections, bridge approaches, and less-maintained paths are prime candidates for lingering ice. A clear day doesn't mean a clear path. A surprise fall is a quick way to regret your "optimistic" shoe choice.

Thinking about planning your long run for tomorrow? Here’s a heads-up:

<AlertBox type="info">
### Friday Brings the Wind
Tomorrow, Friday, February 27, southwest winds are expected to pick up significantly, with sustained speeds of 10-20 mph and gusts potentially hitting 30 mph across the metro. If you're out there, expect to fight a headwind and generally feel a lot colder. Plan your routes accordingly, maybe stick to more sheltered areas.
</AlertBox>

Even further out, the forecast for Saturday, February 28, is calling for potential snow and a sharp temperature drop, so enjoy this relative calm while you can.
