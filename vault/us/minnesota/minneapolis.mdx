Today is absolutely *not* the day to hit those Minneapolis trails without serious caution, unless you're auditioning for a spot on the next Olympic bobsled team.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

### Why today is absolutely *not* the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Bitter Cold & Sneaky Ice:** While the sun might be out, it's a deceptive 21°F (-6°C) and feels even colder thanks to those wind chills. More importantly, the city saw freezing rain and a wintry mix yesterday, leaving behind a nasty glaze of ice. Expect those "clear" patches on the path to be black ice waiting to take you down. Your joints will regret it.</li>
  <li>**Moderate Air Quality (Ozone):** The AQI is sitting at 69, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While not terrible, it’s not ideal for hard efforts, especially when paired with frigid air that can already feel harsh on your lungs.</li>
  <li>**Ongoing Trail Disruptions:** If you were planning a long run around the Chain of Lakes, specifically near Cedar Lake, remember that the Southwest LRT construction has portions of the Cedar Lake Regional Trail and Kenilworth Trail closed for years. Don't count on your usual route being clear, even if the ice allows it.</li>
</BulletList>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ## Black Ice is a Real Threat!
  Yesterday's freezing rain means sidewalks and trails, especially in shaded areas or those less traveled, are likely coated in dangerous black ice. This isn't just a slip; it's a potential sprain, fracture, or worse. The Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board also noted an eastbound Minnehaha Parkway frontage road closure at Nicollet Avenue for storm sewer work, though the two-way parkway and trails should be open. However, residual ice from recent weather events will still be a major concern, particularly on bridges and underpasses where ice can linger.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ## Dress for Extreme Cold
  With temperatures around 21°F (-6°C) and wind increasing to 15 mph overnight, frostbite can occur quickly on exposed skin. Layer up, cover all extremities (hat, gloves, neck gaiter), and choose moisture-wicking materials. Don't be fooled by the sunshine; it offers minimal warmth.

  ## Consider an Indoor Workout
  Seriously, today might be the day to dust off that treadmill or hit a gym. If you *must* venture out, stick to well-maintained, cleared, and salted paths, if you can find them. Take shorter loops and bring your Yaktrax or similar traction devices. And for the love of all that is holy, slow down.
