Alright, Minneapolis, if you're itching to get outside today, it's not the worst call, but let's not pretend it's some kind of balmy spring paradise either.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality, while not sparkling clean with that "Inhalable particulate matter" hanging around, is sitting at a manageable 67 AQI. Your lungs can probably handle it, unless you're usually glued to an oxygen tank.
*   At a crisp 1°C and clear skies, it's just above freezing. Perfect for those who enjoy a bit of chill in their stride, or for showing off that new running jacket.
*   No new widespread trail closures or major event blockades reported for today. Your usual routes should be clear, assuming they weren't already messed up by ongoing projects.

## Today's Rundown

Let's be real, winter's still got one foot in the door, even if the sun's trying to peek through. With the temperature just nudging above freezing, you’ll definitely want layers, but at least you won't be battling icy death traps, at least not *today*. The low pollen count means your sinuses get a break, which is a rare win around here.

The AQI sitting at 67 isn't fantastic, but it's not "stay indoors and panic" bad either. For most of us, that's just a regular Tuesday in the city. If you've got some underlying respiratory issues, you might feel it a bit, but for your average runner, you're not going to be gasping for breath more than usual.

## The Usual Suspects: Trail Troubles & Future Frustrations

<AlertBox type="info">
### Construction Continues to Cramp Your Style
Remember that Green Line Extension project? Yeah, it's still doing its thing. That means the **Kenilworth Trail** and significant chunks of the **Cedar Lake Regional Trail** are still off-limits. Don't be that person who tries to sneak through, thinking you'll be faster than a light rail. You won't, and you'll probably just annoy a construction worker. Plan your detours or find a different route through the Chain of Lakes.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Brace Yourselves: Winds Are Coming (Tomorrow)
While today is relatively calm, Friday (February 27th) is looking like a different beast. Expect southwest winds to pick up, with sustained speeds of 10-20 mph and gusts around 30 mph across the metro. If you're planning an outdoor session tomorrow, be ready to get buffeted around like a tumbleweed. Stronger gusts, up to 50 mph, are predicted further northwest, so if you're heading out of the city, double-check that forecast.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Snowmageddon Lite on Saturday
Just when you thought we might catch a break, here comes Saturday. A "skinny snow band" is rolling in, likely south of I-94, bringing 1-3 inches of fresh powder and, more importantly, a sharp drop in temperatures to single digits. That means slick roads and potentially nasty trail conditions. If you're planning a long run, adjust your expectations or move it indoors. Nobody needs a broken hip for bragging rights.
