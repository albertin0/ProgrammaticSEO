Forget that "winter wonderland" nonsense, Minneapolis. Today, getting your miles in outside is less wonderland and more "wind-blasted tundra."

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   It's bitter out there. Even if the sun peeks through, the wind will cut right through you, making that -7.3°C feel like a solid -14°C. Your lungs will hate you, and your joints will be stiff before you even hit the first mile.
*   We've got a 35% chance of light snow during the day, which, coupled with any existing snowpack from earlier in the week, means slick spots and potential blowing snow reducing visibility. If you're planning on running around Bde Maka Ska, be prepared for gusty winds off the lake kicking up all sorts of icy nastiness.
*   The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 75, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not a red alert, but it's another reason your respiratory system might be feeling extra grumpy today.

## The Full Breakdown for Your Outdoor Misery (er, Workout)

### Weather: It's Just Plain Cold

The temperature is hovering around -7.3°C, but with the wind chill, it genuinely *feels* like -14°C. Dress for serious cold, folks. We're talking multiple layers, windproof outer shells, insulated gloves, and a balaclava that makes you look like a bank robber. Don't skimp, especially if you're out for any length of time. Frostbite happens faster than you think, particularly on exposed skin.

There's a 35% chance of snow falling today, which isn't a huge dump, but it's enough to make surfaces extra slippery. More importantly, the National Weather Service has issued a Winter Weather Advisory for the Twin Cities due to *blowing snow*. Even if there isn't much new accumulation, strong winds can whip up existing snow, creating whiteout conditions and icy patches, especially in open areas like along West River Parkway. Keep your head up and watch your footing.

### Air Quality & Allergies: Breathe... Carefully

Your lungs won't be thrilled with the moderate AQI of 75, primarily due to ozone. For those of us pushing hard, this isn't ideal. Take it down a notch if you feel any chest tightness or unusual shortness of breath. On the bright side, pollen is "Low," so at least your nose won't be running from cedar or birch. It'll just be running from the cold.

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- |
| Low          | 75  | Ozone              |

## Local Obstacles & Nuisances

You'd think winter would slow down the construction, but this is Minneapolis. While the major work on 1st Ave S is mostly done, there's still "punch list work" and landscaping happening through Spring 2026. Similarly, Hennepin Ave S is largely open, but expect "intermittent lane closures" for sanitary sewer lining over the next month. These are mostly car headaches, but pedestrians and cyclists still need to stay alert for changed patterns and detours.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Danger: Hypothermia & Frostbite Risks!** With "feels like" temperatures dropping to -14°C, exposed skin can get frostbitten in minutes. Layers are non-negotiable. If you're running, that sweat will quickly turn into an ice pack if you stop or don't manage your layers properly. Pay attention to numb fingers and toes.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Warning: Slick Surfaces & Reduced Visibility.** That chance of new snow combined with existing ice and potential blowing snow means trails and sidewalks will be treacherous. Areas around the Chain of Lakes, like the popular paths around Lake Harriet, will be particularly susceptible to wind-blown snowdrifts and icy patches. Watch your step, slow down, and maybe opt for traction devices on your shoes.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip: Fuel Up and Stay Hydrated.** Your body burns more calories just to stay warm in these conditions, and you still sweat even when it's freezing. Don't skip your water or underestimate your energy needs for an outdoor workout today. And tell someone where you're going if you're heading out for a longer run.
