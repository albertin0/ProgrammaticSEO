Another day, another opportunity to remember why we live in a city where your snot freezes before it hits the ground. Today’s clear skies are a trap, folks.

<BulletList>
*   That -9.8°C (14.4°F) isn't just a number; it's a constant reminder to layer up, and then layer up some more. We're well past the "crisp" stage and firmly into the "brass monkey" territory. Wind chill is your real enemy out there.
*   Air quality is sitting at a "moderate" 72 AQI, with ozone as the main culprit. If your lungs are usually drama queens, maybe dial it back or stick to the treadmill.
*   Construction never sleeps, apparently, so expect some detours if your route takes you near major infrastructure.

## The "Run Anyway" Rundown

Alright, for those of you who scoff at anything less than frostbite, here’s the deal. The good news? Pollen is practically non-existent right now, so at least your allergies won't be joining the winter misery party.

| Overall     | Low   |

### Mind the Chill

While we're not under the "coldest in seven years" extreme cold warnings we saw back in January, today's -9.8°C is no joke. The weather forecast for Minneapolis today shows clear skies, but it's still staying well below freezing, ranging from 18°F (-8°C) to 37°F (3°C). The real kicker is often the wind chill, which was "near 0" just a few days ago. Keep those extremities covered. Your fingers and toes will thank you later. This isn't the day to test out that new pair of thin running gloves you got for Christmas.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Extreme Cold Advisory: Dress for the deep freeze!** Exposed skin can suffer quickly. Think multiple layers, windproof outer shells, hats, gloves, and maybe even a face mask. Hypothermia isn't a badge of honor; it's a trip to the ER.
</AlertBox>

### Breathe (Carefully)

An AQI of 72 due to ozone puts us in the moderate category. This means that if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally cranky lungs, you might feel some irritation. It’s not a full-blown "stay inside" alert, but it’s definitely a "listen to your body" suggestion. Maybe skip those lung-busting intervals today and keep it to a steady, comfortable pace.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality Alert (Ozone):** Sensitive groups, children, and people with respiratory conditions should consider shortening their outdoor workouts or taking them indoors. Don't push it if you feel any discomfort.
</AlertBox>

### Trail Trouble

The Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board still lists **Stone Arch Bridge Repairs** as an ongoing project. If your scenic route involves that iconic crossing, be prepared for potential detours or limited access. Always check the Park Board's current projects page before heading out. Beyond that, significant construction on I-394 is scheduled to resume this month, which could snarl up approaches to trails in that corridor. And let's not forget the ever-present Southwest LRT construction, which has its own smattering of trail closures. Assume if there's a good view, someone's probably tearing it up or rerouting it.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Navigation:** Always check for current trail closures and detours, especially around major landmarks like the Stone Arch Bridge or areas impacted by Southwest LRT or I-394 work. A quick check can save you a frustrating dead end.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're determined to get out there, be smart, dress for the conditions, and keep an eye on that moderate air. Your lungs and joints are less forgiving than you think.
