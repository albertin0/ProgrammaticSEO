If you’re thinking of an outdoor workout in Saint Paul today, you’re looking at a mixed bag of winter nastiness and decent air, but mostly just *nasty*.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **The Air Quality is Just Okay:** AQI is clocking in at 74, which means "Moderate," with ozone as the main culprit. For most of us, it's fine, but if you've got lung issues, you might feel it.
*   **It's Seriously Cold (and Snowy):** We're talking -7.4°C (that's about 18°F) and a wind chill that'll make your eyeballs freeze. A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for the Twin Cities area until 3 PM today, bringing 2 to 4 inches of snow. Expect slippery surfaces and reduced visibility.
*   **Construction Never Sleeps:** There's enough road work going on to make navigating some of your favorite routes a headache, especially around major arteries.
</BulletList>

## Today's Rundown: Frostbite, Ozone, and Detours

Look, it's clear out there, but "clear" doesn't mean "warm" in February in Minnesota. That -7.4°C is just the start. Factor in a decent breeze, and you're quickly into wind chill territory that makes 18°F feel like something much, much colder – possibly even into single digits. Your lungs are going to get a shock, and your joints will be screaming if you don't layer up like you're heading to the Arctic.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### **Brutal Cold & Slippery Surfaces**
A Winter Weather Advisory is on for Saint Paul. We’re expecting 2-4 inches of snow today, with potential for localized heavier bands and reduced visibility. This means slippery roads and trails. Combine that with freezing temps, and you’ve got prime conditions for falls and injuries. Don't be a hero; adjust your pace and expect the unexpected.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the air. A "Moderate" AQI of 74 with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't ideal. While not "unhealthy" for everyone, those with respiratory sensitivities might find themselves coughing a bit more or feeling winded faster. This isn't a day to push PRs if you’re trying to avoid a post-run wheeze.

## Where Not to Get Stuck (or Freeze)

If you're still determined to get out there, be smart. That gorgeous stretch of **Mississippi River Boulevard** might look appealing, but with potential for fresh snow and blowing conditions, parts of it could be slick or obscured. Be extra cautious, especially on inclines or shaded spots where ice loves to hide.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### **Ongoing Construction & Road Closures**
If you typically run near downtown, know that there are significant ongoing projects. The Kellogg/3rd St Bridge is fully closed until December 2026, and the Jackson Street Bridge has a full closure through March. Even a tree removal project along I-35E near Shepard Road, reported yesterday, could snarl access or create debris. Check the city's website before you head out, because getting rerouted mid-run when it's this cold is a special kind of awful. Oh, and Highway 280 is set for a full closure between I-94 and I-35W/Highway 36 this year for resurfacing and repairs, so avoid that area.
</AlertBox>

My advice? If you absolutely *have* to run outside, dress like a lunatic, wear traction on your shoes, and stick to well-trafficked, cleared paths. Or, you know, hit the treadmill and save your joints (and dignity) for a better day.

*Data grounded with KARE 11 from February 27, 2026.*
