You know, sometimes Saint Paul throws us a curveball. Today? It's a weird mix of "could be worse" and "don't breathe too deeply."

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
- The good news first: pollen is practically non-existent. Go ahead and sniff all the crisp winter air you want. Well, mostly.
- The not-so-good news: our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 65, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. This isn't "stay inside and bubble wrap your lungs" bad, but it's definitely not ideal for pushing your limits, especially if you're sensitive.
- Expect some detours. Construction season never truly ends here. Major projects are always kicking off, closing off, or just generally making a mess of our usual routes.
</BulletList>

Look, the temperature is hovering around 2 degrees Celsius, feeling a bit chillier at -2 degrees Celsius. It's clear skies, so at least you won't be slogging through snow or ice, which is a definite win for the joints. But that moderate AQI is a real buzzkill for your lungs, especially during a hard effort. AccuWeather even warns that "sensitive groups may experience minor to moderate symptoms from long-term exposure" and advises reducing time spent outside if you're feeling symptoms like difficulty breathing. Pay attention to your body out there.

### Don't Choke on Particles
The moderate AQI, specifically the inhalable particulate matter, means your lungs are working overtime to filter that stuff out. If you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, seriously consider an indoor workout today. For the rest of us, take it easy on those heavy breathing efforts. Maybe skip the tempo run and stick to a conversational pace along the Mississippi River trails.

Speaking of trails, get ready for some urban navigation. The city is a patchwork of ongoing construction. While not all of it impacts pedestrian or bike routes directly, the sheer volume means increased traffic and general disruption. For example, Highway 280 is set for a full closure this year, between I-94 and Highway 36/I-35W in Roseville. That's a huge artery, and even if you're not driving, its closure can shift traffic patterns onto smaller streets you might be running or cycling on. And you know how the Mississippi River trails go; they're constantly seeing closures for flooding, construction, or just general upkeep. Always double-check your route before heading out, especially around areas like Crosby Park Regional Park where the boardwalk and fishing pier are currently closed for rebuilding.

### Construction Chaos Continues
The Kellogg/3rd St Bridge remains fully closed until late December 2026, and the Jackson Street Bridge project also has full road closures until March. These aren't just car problems; they force detours, create congestion, and can make crossing town on foot or bike a real headache. Keep your head on a swivel. Assume drivers are distracted.

### Dress for the "Feels Like"
With 2.3°C but a "feels like" temperature of -2°C, layering is your friend. A good base layer, a light mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell will serve you well. Don't forget gloves and a hat or ear band, even if the sun's out. It might be clear, but that chill can bite.

So, enjoy the crisp air and low pollen, but keep your eyes peeled for construction detours and your lungs mindful of that particulate matter. It's Saint Paul in late February – you gotta earn that outdoor sweat.
