If you absolutely *must* get outside today, February 26th, bundle up, watch your breathing, and avoid the river trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   That "moderate" AQI is hiding some nasty particulate matter you don't want in your lungs, especially if you're pushing it.
*   The actual air temperature might be above freezing, but a brutal wind chill of 8°F makes it feel like deep winter.
*   Pollen count is low, so at least your nose won't be actively fighting you today.

## The Chilly Truth: Saint Paul Outdoor Workout Report for February 26, 2026

Alright, runners, cyclists, and general masochists of Saint Paul, let's talk about hitting the pavement (or what's left of it) today. The calendar says late February, but the air still bites like January.

First, let's address the air you'll be sucking into those precious lungs. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 77, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. Don't let "moderate" lull you into a false sense of security. While one source showed AQI dipping as low as 11 recently, another pegs today's AQI in South St. Paul as "Poor" for sensitive groups. If you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity, this is a red flag. PM10 can irritate your airways, and nobody wants that cough-and-wheeze symphony halfway through their run.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**LUNG ALERT:** AQI of 77 with high particulate matter means those with asthma or other respiratory issues should seriously consider an indoor alternative. Even healthy runners might feel it.
</AlertBox>

Now, for the joints. It's 1.5°C (about 35°F) out there, which sounds okay, right? Wrong. The wind chill is a nasty 8°F. That's practically hypothermia territory if you're not properly layered and moving. Cold muscles are tight muscles, and tight muscles are injury magnets. Don't be that person limping around with a pulled hamstring because you thought a light jacket was enough.

Good news for allergy sufferers, at least. No yellow haze or sneezing fits from pollen today.

### Trail Conditions & Construction Chaos

Given the recent "Winter Load Increases" ending on February 24th in our frost zones, expect some serious freeze-thaw cycles. This means slick spots, hidden ice, and slush puddles are probably lurking, especially on shaded paths or anywhere drainage is less than ideal. The Mississippi River trails are notoriously susceptible to these conditions this time of year, with general warnings about "ice, snow, or other conditions" along the riverfront. Watch your footing out there, especially around turns or descents. A slip and fall on ice is a surefire way to earn yourself a physical therapy appointment (and trust me, I see enough of those).

<AlertBox type="danger">
**ICE & WIND CHILL HAZARD:** That 8°F wind chill combined with potential icy patches on less-maintained trails like parts of the Mississippi River trails means a high risk for falls and cold-related injury. Be extremely cautious.
</AlertBox>

There's also ongoing construction across the city. While no major marathon-route-blocking events are listed for today, you've got lane restrictions on 6th Street downtown until tomorrow, and sewer utility work impacting Robert Street between 10th and 7th until mid-March. If your route takes you through downtown, expect minor detours or slowed traffic. Don't count on a clear path; Saint Paul always has a project going.

<AlertBox type="info">
**PRO TIP:** If you're running along the river, consider sticking to the higher-traffic, more visible paths that might get better maintenance. And for the love of all that is holy, wear reflective gear. Drivers aren't expecting you in this weather.
</AlertBox>

My honest take? If you're determined to get outside, stick to known, well-lit, and likely-cleared main roads or sidewalks. Don't go chasing PRs today. It's a "maintain, don't gain" kind of day.
