Today's a pretty decent day to get outside in Henderson, just remember your lungs aren't made of steel and those road crews aren't taking a holiday for your PR attempt.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are gorgeous, sitting at a comfortable 19.2°C (that's pushing 67°F for you non-metric folks) with clear skies. Perfect for a long run or a solid hike.
*   Pollen count is finally playing nice, keeping it low across the board. Your sinuses can breathe a sigh of relief.
*   AQI is sitting at 65, which is "moderate," but with nitrogen dioxide as the star pollutant, it's not exactly sparkling desert air. Don't be surprised if your lungs feel it, especially if you're prone to respiratory issues.

## The Rundown

Alright, Henderson, let's talk brass tacks. The weather truly is on our side today. That crisp 19.2°C with clear skies is prime running weather, no excuses about scorching sun or freezing winds. And with pollen levels mercifully low, even those of us who usually sniffle our way through spring can enjoy some uninterrupted outdoor time. Go hit the **River Mountains Loop Trail** and soak it in.

| Pollen Type | Level (Ambee) |
| :---------- | :------------ |
| Overall     | Low           |

But before you lace up and sprint out the door like a gazelle, let's not forget where we live. This city is constantly growing, which means constant construction.

### Air Quality Check

Our Air Quality Index is currently 65. Now, on the grand scale, that's "moderate." But the kicker is the dominant pollutant: nitrogen dioxide. That stuff comes from vehicle emissions and industrial activity, and while 65 isn't "unhealthy" for everyone, it can definitely irk sensitive individuals. Think about it – if you're out there hammering away a tempo run, you're breathing deep. More deep breaths mean more exposure.

| Metric             | Value | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------------- | :---- | :----------------- |
| AQI                | 65    | Nitrogen dioxide   |
| Health Advisory    | Moderate for most; sensitive groups may experience minor effects |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory:** While the overall AQI is moderate, the presence of nitrogen dioxide means those with asthma, COPD, or other respiratory sensitivities might still feel it. Pay attention to your body. If you feel any throat irritation or breathing difficulty, it's not your imagination. Cut your workout short or take it inside.
</AlertBox>

### Construction Zone Chaos

Now for the real constant in Henderson: construction. That "Reimagine Boulder Highway" project is still chugging along, having just passed its halfway mark. They're adding bike lanes and transit, which is great for the future, but right now, it's a mess of intermittent lane closures and heavy machinery. You'll find similar headaches with the I-215 widening project between Pecos and Stephanie, set to drag on until mid-2028. Most of that major work happens overnight, but the aftermath and ongoing tweaks can still impact your route, especially if you're biking or trying to cross intersections.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Navigation:** If your route takes you near Boulder Highway or I-215 between Pecos and Stephanie, expect delays and altered pathways. Plan your runs or rides with extra time, or better yet, opt for a trail further away from the main arteries. The last thing you need is a close call with a dump truck when you're in the zone.
</AlertBox>

No major trail closures to report today, and thankfully, no recent smoke advisories from any fires. Flooding, while a historical nuisance around here, isn't a current threat for Henderson as of today. So, hydrate well, watch for traffic near construction, and enjoy that rare low-pollen air while it lasts.
