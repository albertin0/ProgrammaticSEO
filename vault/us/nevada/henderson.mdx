If you’re heading out for a run today, Henderson, you better be ready to dodge some cones and inhale some particulates, because while the weather's decent, our city's still a construction zone.

## Today's Rundown

| Factor           | Status       |
| :--------------- | :----------- |
| **Temperature**  | 22.8°C (Clear) |
| **Air Quality**  | AQI 61 (Moderate) |
| **Pollen Level** | Low          |
| **Dominant Pollutant** | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) |

<BulletList>
*   The temperature is actually pretty solid, hovering around a comfortable 22.8°C (73°F) and clear skies means you won't be melting or soaked.
*   That AQI of 61 is teetering on "Moderate" and means "Inhalable particulate matter" is hanging around. If your lungs are sensitive, you might feel this one.
*   Pollen is low, so at least your sneezes won't be adding to the general respiratory irritation.
*   Construction, Henderson's favorite pastime, is still widespread and actively messing with your usual routes.

### Local Hazards & Hot Spots

Look, the desert isn't exactly known for its pristine, uninterrupted running paths, but Henderson takes the cake with how much digging and paving is going on.

That infamous **Reimagine Boulder Highway** project is still a beast. They're laying groundwork for BRT stations and tweaking traffic signals, which means intermittent lane closures and general chaos from Wagon Wheel Drive down to Greenway Road. Residents are already griping about how long it’s taking and the headaches it causes, especially for anyone not in a car. So, if your usual long run takes you anywhere near Boulder, expect detours, uneven surfaces, and a healthy dose of dust.

Speaking of new developments, don't forget about the new asphalt trail construction along **Via Inspirada**, stretching from Via da Vinci to Volunteer Boulevard. They're adding bike lanes and improving 13 crossings, which sounds great for the future, but right now it just means more active work zones you'll need to navigate. Keep your head up and stay aware; these aren't exactly scenic detours.

And for those of you who venture further, there's also the **I-215 Widening project** which includes ramp upgrades and a new pedestrian bridge over Green Valley Pkwy at Village Walk Dr. Even if you're not on the I-215 itself, access roads and surrounding areas could be impacted by heavy equipment.

**Heads up, trail runners!** If you're planning a trip to the Spring Mountains, several popular trails like Mary Jane Falls and Trail Canyon are currently closed. Don't waste the drive; check Go Mt. Charleston for current conditions before you head out.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**AQI is moderate, but the particulate matter is no joke.** If you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, today might be better for an indoor workout or at least sticking to shorter, less intense outdoor sessions. That "inhalable particulate matter" is exactly what you *don't* want to be sucking deep into your lungs during a tempo run.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Always double-check local traffic and construction updates** before you go, especially if you're hitting lesser-known routes. The city's website often has the latest, or check the RTC for bus detours that might indicate road work. It's better to know ahead of time than to get stuck trying to cross a freshly dug trench.
