It's a pretty sweet day to get out there, just don't go breathing too deep if you're sensitive, and for Pete's sake, check your route.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Seriously, these Henderson skies are clear, and the 19.1°C (66.4°F) temp is about as perfect as it gets for hammering out some miles or hitting the pavement on your bike. No excuses for being a couch potato based on the weather.
*   However, we're sitting in the "Moderate" zone for air quality. It's not a red alert, but that dominant inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) means your lungs might notice it, especially if you're pushing hard or have any existing respiratory issues.
*   Major construction continues to chew up parts of the I-215 Trail, meaning your planned long run might hit a hard stop or a confusing detour. Plan ahead, folks, or you'll be doing extra road miles you didn't budget for.

## Pollen Breakdown

Good news for allergy sufferers: the pollen count is low. Go ahead and sniff the desert flowers, if you can find any.

## Air Quality — The Invisible Grind

Look, I've seen worse. An AQI of 74 isn't exactly "stay indoors and hermetically seal your house" territory, but it's not pristine mountain air either. We're in the yellow, which means "Moderate." The dominant pollutant, inhalable particulate matter, is the stuff that gets into your lungs. If you're generally healthy and doing a casual walk around Cornerstone Park, you'll probably be fine. But if you're planning a lung-busting tempo run on the River Mountains Loop Trail, or if you're one of those folks with asthma or other respiratory conditions, you might want to dial it back. The Las Vegas-Henderson metro area has historically struggled with ozone and particle pollution, so this isn't exactly new news.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate AQI Means Listen to Your Lungs:** An AQI of 74 is okay for most, but if you're sensitive, pregnant, a child, or elderly, consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Maybe push that interval workout to tomorrow or keep it indoors. Long-term exposure to this stuff isn't a badge of honor.

## Weather — Goldilocks Zone

Today's weather is *chefs kiss*. 19.1°C (66.4°F) and clear skies means you've got zero excuses to bail on your workout because of the elements. It's that sweet spot where you don't need a jacket, but you're not instantly melting either. Hydrate like it's summer, because even perfect weather can sneak up on you in the desert.

## Trail & Road Hazards — Construction Ahead!

Alright, here's where your meticulously planned route might get a little… rerouted. The I-215 Widening project is still in full swing, and it's directly impacting our beloved trail system. Specifically, significant, long-term closures are in effect on parts of the 215 Trail.

<BulletList>
*   **215 Trail (Green Valley Pkwy to Valle Verde Dr):** Closed for soundwall installation. You're detoured to Paseo Verde Pkwy.
*   **215 Trail (Arroyo Grande Blvd to Stephanie St):** Also closed for retaining walls. Another detour to Paseo Verde Pkwy.
</BulletList>

If you were planning to cruise these sections, you'll be taking the scenic (read: longer, less enjoyable) route on Paseo Verde. This means more road crossings, potentially more traffic, and definitely more frustration if you didn't know about it. Plan your run or ride accordingly, or you'll be adding unintended hill repeats to your day when you hit a dead-end. The City of Henderson's "Current Projects" page confirms this ongoing work.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Detour Smart:** If you're hitting the I-215 Trail today, especially between Green Valley Pkwy and Stephanie St, double-check the City of Henderson's official project pages. Expect detours and plan your water stops and mileage accordingly. Nobody likes a surprise extra five miles.

So, get out there, enjoy the perfect temps, but keep an eye on that moderate air quality and be ready to improvise on the trails.
