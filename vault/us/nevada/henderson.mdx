Alright, Henderson, let's talk about hitting the trails today. Honestly? If your lungs aren't made of steel, maybe reconsider that long run.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   **Air quality is a real problem.** While the pollen count is low, the overall Air Quality Index is trending poor, primarily due to Nitrogen Dioxide. This isn't just a sniffle risk; it's genuinely unhealthy for sensitive groups.
*   **Construction season is always in full swing.** You know the drill. While no major trail closures were announced in the last 24 hours, ongoing road and trail work, like the massive "Reimagine Boulder Highway" project, means detours and dust are a constant companion.
*   **Weather is a mixed bag.** We've got clear skies and a comfortable 20.7°C, which sounds lovely, but it also means those pollutants are just hanging out, not getting cleared out by any significant wind or rain.

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Deeply

Look, I'm usually all for pushing through, but today's air quality in Henderson is listed as "Poor," and that's not just some suggestion. Specifically, Nitrogen Dioxide is the dominant pollutant, which can really mess with your respiratory system. If you've got any kind of lung issue, or even if you just like breathing without a wheeze, seriously scale back or move your workout indoors. AccuWeather is even warning that the air has reached a high level of pollution and is unhealthy for sensitive groups, advising to reduce time spent outside if you're experiencing symptoms. That's a strong enough recommendation for me.

<AlertBox type="danger">
    **Danger: Poor Air Quality!** The AQI is pushing into unhealthy territory for sensitive groups due to Nitrogen Dioxide. Limit prolonged outdoor exertion, especially if you have respiratory conditions.

### Construction & Trail Annoyances

It wouldn't be Henderson without some orange cones, right? The "Reimagine Boulder Highway" project is still a beast, creating traffic headaches and general disruption that can spill over to nearby routes. And if you're planning on hitting up some of our fantastic pathways, remember there's always local work happening. For instance, the city has ongoing trail improvement projects, like the Via Inspirada Trail Project, which is adding asphalt and improving bike lane crossings. While these ultimately make our trails better, during construction, it means navigating around active work zones. No specific *new* trail closures were reported in the last 24 hours, but always be aware of your surroundings, especially if you're on a popular route like sections of the Union Pacific Railroad Trail that might crisscross affected areas.

<AlertBox type="warning">
    **Warning: Ongoing Construction.** Be prepared for potential detours, dust, and uneven surfaces near major road and trail projects, including the long-term "Reimagine Boulder Highway" work.

    **Pro Tip:** Even with low pollen, the poor air quality means you should consider wearing a mask if you're determined to be outside, and definitely stay hydrated.
