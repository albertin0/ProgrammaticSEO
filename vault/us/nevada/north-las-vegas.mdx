Today's a pretty sweet day to get outside in North Las Vegas, as long as your lungs are ready for some airborne grit and you're good at dodging construction cones.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Clear skies and a comfortable 17.6°C (63.7°F) mean your joints are probably doing a happy dance, no extreme temps to worry about.
*   But don't get too smug; the air quality is sitting at a moderate AQI of 60, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the main culprit, plus a moderate pollen count. Your lungs might have opinions.
*   Construction and long-term detours are still the uninvited guests on some of our favorite routes, so stay vigilant.
</BulletList>

Look, the weather gods are mostly on our side for February 26th. We're talking clear skies and a pleasant 17.6°C (63.7°F) which is practically perfect for hitting the pavement or the dirt. It's prime time for a run around the Aliante Trail System without baking or freezing your bits off. Just don't expect perfectly pristine air or totally clear pathways.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 60, which is "moderate." What does that mean for you? It means there's enough inhalable particulate matter floating around that if you're sensitive, you might notice it. Think of it as a subtle sandpapering of your lungs, especially when you're sucking wind on a long climb. Add to that a "moderate" pollen level, and your allergies might decide today's the day to remind you they exist.

<AlertBox type="warning">
If you've got sensitive lungs, asthma, or seasonal allergies, today's "moderate" AQI and pollen levels mean you might want to stick to shorter, lower-intensity workouts or hit the gym. Pay attention to how you feel, and don't push it if you're wheezing more than usual.

Beyond the invisible air quality, the visible world has its own challenges. Construction, glorious construction, continues its eternal dance across the valley. While there aren't any *new* major trail-blocking disasters reported in the last 24 hours, remember that several long-term detours are still in effect. For instance, sections of the River Mountains Loop Trail near the Alfred Merritt Smith Water Treatment Facility are routed onto Lakeshore Road due to ongoing aqueduct construction. Also, if you're near the I-215 Summerlin Parkway Interchange, be aware of pedestrian and cycle trail detours as part of the preservation project. Don't assume your usual path is clear; a quick check of the RTC Southern Nevada alerts before you head out is always a smart move.

<AlertBox type="info">
Keep an eye out for unexpected detours, especially around major roadwork like the I-215 preservation project, which has ongoing pedestrian/cycle trail detours. Check RTC Southern Nevada for current street closures if your route involves city streets or shared-use paths adjacent to them.
