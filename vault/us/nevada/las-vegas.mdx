Today's a mixed bag, Vegas. Don't let that sunshine fool you entirely.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is *not* entirely the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality Alert (for some):** While the official AQI is a decent 46, AccuWeather is calling today "Poor" for sensitive groups, with warnings about elevated particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. If your lungs are finicky, take note.
*   **Pollen Pocalypse:** High pollen levels are in full swing, especially if you're prone to seasonal miseries. Think watery eyes, runny nose, and that general "I'm fighting a ghost" feeling.
*   **Trail Blockages & Detours:** Ongoing construction projects mean your usual routes might be unexpectedly closed or rerouted, especially if you favor the 215 Western Beltway Trail or the new Summerlin Parkway Trail.

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

| Pollutant Type                   | Level         | Recommendation                                                                      |
| :------------------------------- | :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overall AQI (Ambee)              | 46 (Good)     | Generally acceptable for most individuals.                                          |
| Overall AQI (AccuWeather)        | Poor          | Unhealthy for sensitive groups; reduce time spent outside.                 |
| Dominant Pollutant (Ambee)       | PM&lt;10µm     | Inhalable particulate matter.                                                       |
| Nitrogen Dioxide (AccuWeather)   | Poor          | Increases risk of respiratory problems.                                   |
| Particulate Matter (PM2.5/PM10)  | Fair (AccuW.) | Can enter lungs and bloodstream, resulting in health issues.               |
| Pollen                           | High          | Expect significant allergic reactions for those sensitive.                          |

<AlertBox type="warning">
Despite a clear sky and pleasant 20.1°C (68°F), the air isn't quite as pristine as it looks. AccuWeather specifically warns that air quality is "Poor" today, recommending sensitive groups reduce time outdoors due to high levels of particulate matter and Nitrogen Dioxide. Don't shrug this off if you're an asthmatic or have other respiratory issues. Your lungs will thank you for taking it easy or staying indoors.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
If you're dead set on getting your miles in, stick to areas with less vehicular traffic to minimize particulate inhalation. Consider a shorter, lower-intensity workout. Today's a good day for a chill walk around your neighborhood, not trying to PR a 10K.

### Construction & Trail Hazards

Heads up for those who run the trails! The Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, including much of Mt. Charleston, still has a number of major closures in effect, like Cathedral Rock Trail and Mary Jane Falls Trail. Don't plan on hitting those summits today; you'll just be turning around.

Closer to home, the 215 Western Beltway Trail is under significant construction. There are "back-to-back weekend closures" of the 215 Beltway ramps at Charleston Boulevard starting tomorrow (Friday, Feb 27) through Monday, March 1, as crews install concrete boxes for new trail undercrossings. While today isn't a direct closure day for the ramps, expect ongoing work and potential detours on sections of the trail itself as the project progresses.

Similarly, if you're in Summerlin, the new Summerlin Parkway Trail project is chugging along. Crestdale Lane is closed for three months, starting in late January, to construct a tunnel under the road. This means detours and potential disruptions if your route involves that area. It's a 12-foot-wide asphalt pathway in the making, which will be great *eventually*, but for now, it's a construction zone.

<AlertBox type="danger">
With the persistent "High" pollen count, make sure you've taken your allergy meds *before* you head out, and maybe carry some tissues. If you start feeling wheezy or your throat gets scratchy, don't push it. There's always tomorrow.
