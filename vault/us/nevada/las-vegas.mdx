Alright, Las Vegas, let's talk about hitting the pavement today.

Today's a decent day for a run, provided you're not allergic to everything currently blooming, and you don't mind dodging construction cones.

<BulletList>
*   Pollen is high, so your sinuses might decide to run their own marathon while you're out there. Don't say I didn't warn you.
*   The air quality, for once, isn't trying to actively kill you. The AQI is good, which is a pleasant surprise given past smoke issues.
*   Construction around the valley, particularly on the west side, means your usual routes might have unexpected detours or uneven surfaces.

## The Rundown for February 28, 2026

First, let's address the elephant in the valley – the high pollen count. If you're one of the unfortunate souls who swells up like a pufferfish when allergens are in the air, you already know the drill. Today, everything from juniper to mulberry is probably trying to get into your airways. While the air quality index (AQI) itself is sitting at a "good" 45, with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, that doesn't account for the microscopic invaders making your eyes itch and your nose run. Don't confuse "good AQI" with "allergy-free paradise." They are not the same thing.

### Allergy Alert: High Pollen Today
If you suffer from seasonal allergies, today's high pollen count is going to be a nuisance. Consider an antihistamine before you head out, and maybe opt for an indoor workout if your symptoms are usually severe. Otherwise, prepare for some serious post-run sinus drainage.

Weather-wise, we're looking at a clear day with a current temperature around 18.2°C (64.8°F). This is pretty mild for a late February morning. However, don't get too comfortable; forecasts from just yesterday were hinting at temperatures reaching up to 87°F today, which would be well above normal for this time of year. So, while your morning miles might feel pleasant, if you're planning an afternoon session, be ready for it to warm up considerably. Hydration, as always in this desert, is non-negotiable.

Now for the fun part: dodging orange cones. Construction continues to be a staple of the Las Vegas landscape, and it affects more than just your commute. The **Summerlin Parkway Trail Project** is still chugging along, bringing a new 3.5-mile shared-use trail, but also ongoing disruptions. Specifically, Crestdale Lane has been closed for three months since January 2026 for a tunnel construction. This means if you typically run or bike in that area, you'll need to find an alternative route or be prepared for significant detours and potential dust from the worksite. The I-215 Beltway and its interchange with Summerlin Parkway are also undergoing major overhauls, so expect lane restrictions and general chaos in those areas.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Construction Zone Awareness
If your route takes you anywhere near the Summerlin Parkway or I-215, be aware of ongoing construction. Crestdale Lane is currently closed for tunnel work. Watch for changed traffic patterns, uneven surfaces, and construction vehicles. Plan your route ahead of time and stay vigilant.

On the bright side, no recent reports of major wildfires causing widespread smoke *today* that would significantly degrade our air beyond the pollen. The dramatic high winds we saw earlier this month on February 18th, with gusts up to 75 mph, are also thankfully not a factor. And good news for downtown runners: the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon and other early February road closures are long gone.

So, lace up, grab your allergy meds if needed, stay hydrated, and be aware of your surroundings, especially if you're out west. It's Vegas, baby, even the air tries to keep you on your toes.
