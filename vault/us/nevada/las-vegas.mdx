It's one of those "looks good on paper, but your body knows better" kind of days out there in Las Vegas.

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky is deceiving; we're in a high pollen count, so expect those lungs and sinuses to put in extra work.
*   Temperatures are pleasant *now*, but the National Weather Service has issued a "minor heat risk" for the valley, with highs expected to hit 83°F today and climb to 85°F by Saturday. Early-season heat is no joke, especially if you're not acclimated.
*   Don't forget the ongoing construction and trail closures; your usual routes might be blocked or rerouted.

## The Air You're Breathing

While the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting pretty at a "Good" 47, don't let that lull you into a false sense of security. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, but the real silent killer today is the *pollen*. It's high, folks. Your allergies probably already told you that.

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- |
| High         | 47  | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) |

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Pollen Power Hour
High pollen means your respiratory system is already under assault before you even lace up. If you're prone to seasonal allergies or exercise-induced asthma, seriously consider an indoor alternative, or at least pre-medicate and carry your inhaler. This isn't the day to try for a PR if you want to avoid a snot-soaked misery fest.

## Trail Talk & Temperature Traps

The thermometer says 72°F right now, which sounds glorious for a run. The problem? It's going to be climbing steadily throughout the day, hitting around 83°F. The National Weather Service even put out a "minor heat risk" warning. We're not in the dog days of summer yet, so your body hasn't adapted to this kind of warmth. Dehydration can sneak up on you faster than a tourist trying to cut in line at the buffet.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Don't Be a Heat Casualty
Even if it feels "nice" when you start, this early-season heat can be dangerous if you're not used to it. Carry more water than you think you need, wear light clothing, and for the love of all that is holy, don't leave your furry friends or small humans in the car. Keep an eye on the clock; aim for early morning or late evening if you can.

### Construction Zone Chaos

Planning a long ride or run on the **215 Western Beltway Trail**? Heads up. Ramps at Charleston are undergoing back-to-back weekend closures starting Friday night for trail undercrossing construction. This project aims to improve the multi-use trail, but for now, it means detours and potential frustration. Likewise, up in Summerlin, the **Summerlin Parkway Trail** project means Crestdale Lane is fully closed for three months, building a new trail tunnel connecting to the CC-215 Beltway Trail and Bonanza Trail. So, if you're in that neck of the woods, expect some rerouting.

For those looking to escape to the mountains, remember that many trails on **Mt. Charleston** are still closed from previous weather events, including popular spots like Cathedral Rock, Mary Jane Falls, Trail Canyon, and Upper Bristlecone. You can still hit a portion of Lower Bristlecone, but it's an out-and-back. Always check current conditions before you drive all the way up there for nothing.

### Plan Your Route, Seriously
Construction is a constant in this city, and it impacts trails. Check official sources for closures before you head out, especially on major routes like the 215 Beltway and around Summerlin. And if you're hitting Mt. Charleston, know before you go to avoid a wasted trip to a closed trailhead.
