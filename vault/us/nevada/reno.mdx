Alright, Reno, listen up. Today's one of those rare days where you *almost* don't have an excuse to stay on the couch, unless you're planning a trip to the backcountry, in which case, just don't.

<LungsJointsScore score={8} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air's actually decent for once, AQI sitting pretty at 46. Your lungs can mostly thank the lack of smoke from California for that.</li>
  <li>Pollen? Low. Allergy sufferers, rejoice. Your nose won't try to run a marathon on its own today.</li>
  <li>Weather is clear and a mild 11.8°C (about 53°F). Perfect for ditching the heavy layers, assuming you're not easily fooled by "spring in February."</li>
  <li>**BUT**, if your idea of "workout" involves actual mountains, stay put. The Central Sierra Nevada is an avalanche risk with wet, unstable snow. Seriously, don't be *that* person.</li>
  <li>Construction is always a thing in this city, and there are a few spots to watch out for.</li>
</BulletList>

## Today's Rundown: Clear Skies, Clearer Head (Mostly)

Let's be real, you rarely get a perfect day in Reno. There's usually a wildfire plume, a dust storm, or temperatures that could boil water or freeze your eyelashes off. But today, February 26, 2026, is leaning towards the "get outside" column, especially if your routine keeps you within city limits.

The air quality is a respectable 46, with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. It's not perfectly crisp mountain air, but it's far from the "don't breathe too deeply unless you want lung gravel" days we often endure. Pollen count is low, so your seasonal sniffles should be at bay. And that 11.8°C and clear sky? That's about as good as it gets for February in the Biggest Little City. Don't waste it.

### Pollen Breakdown

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Hazard Alert: Sierra Backcountry is a No-Go!**
  
  Listen up, snow junkies and peak baggers: The Central Sierra Nevada is under dangerous avalanche conditions. Wet, unstable snow means you should absolutely, unequivocally avoid avalanche terrain. Don't even think about a high-elevation trail run or ski tour today. It's not worth it.
</AlertBox>

### Watch Your Step, Especially Downtown

While the weather *within* Reno is behaving, a warm system is moving through the region. The National Weather Service is talking about gusty winds and potential poor drainage flooding in creeks and streams, plus snow sliding off roofs at higher elevations. For those hitting the **Truckee Riverwalk**, keep an eye out for potentially wet or slippery banks and debris. The river might be running a bit higher or faster than usual, so give it some respect.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Construction Zones: The Eternal Reno Obstacle**
  
  Reno's always building something, right? City Council recently approved several projects, including the O'Brien's Pass Safety Project, Keystone Avenue Safety Improvements, and South Virginia Reconstruction. Additionally, site work is underway for a new luxury home community, Ascente by Toll Brothers, in South Reno. While these aren't full trail closures (unless you're running down the middle of Virginia Street, which, please don't), expect some detours or increased traffic if your route takes you through these areas. Plan ahead to avoid having your stride interrupted by a backhoe.

So, lace up those shoes, grab some water, and enjoy the mild air. Just be smart about where you're going, especially if "running a few miles" turns into "climbing a mountain."
