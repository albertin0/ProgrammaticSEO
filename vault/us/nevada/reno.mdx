Alright, Reno, here's the deal for your Saturday workout: it's not terrible, but if you're heading for the hills or have sensitive lungs, maybe take it down a notch.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Moderate Air Quality for Many, but "Poor" for Sensitive Lungs:** While the overall AQI is moderate, the dominant particulate matter (&lt;10µm) means sensitive groups might feel it.
*   **Sierra Ridgetops are a Wind Tunnel:** If your weekend plans involve high-elevation trail running, be advised that Sierra ridgetops are getting absolutely blasted with gusts over 60 mph.
*   **Rivers are Running High:** Recent mild temps mean those mountain streams and rivers, like our beloved Truckee, are seeing high flows. Stay clear of the banks unless you fancy an impromptu, chilly swim.
</BulletList>

## The Rundown for February 28, 2026

It's a "clear" day at 8.8°C (about 48°F), but let's be real, "clear" doesn't mean "perfect." The NWS is forecasting things a bit differently, leaning towards cloudy with a 20% chance of rain today, and valley temperatures pushing into the upper 60s Fahrenheit. So, you might get a little drizzle or a surprisingly warm pocket depending on where you are.

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply (If You're Sensitive)

Your local air quality report pegs the AQI at 73, which is "Moderate." The bad news is the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (PM10). Now, for most of us, that's just a mild annoyance, maybe a bit of a cough if you're really pushing it. But if you've got asthma, COPD, or just a generally grumpy respiratory system, the forecast for today puts Reno's air quality in the "Poor" category for sensitive groups, specifically due to PM10. We're talking about tiny particles kicked up from, well, everything – wind-blown dust, some lingering construction. So if you're prone to lung irritation, maybe stick to some indoor stairs or the treadmill. Don't be a hero.

Here's the pollen breakdown, which at least is playing nice:

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

### Weather & Terrain: Watch Your Step

The good news is we're not dealing with extreme cold today. The mild temperatures are a nice change.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**High Winds in the Sierra Ridgetops:** Seriously, if you're planning on hitting trails up high, think twice. Gusts over 60 mph are no joke and can knock you off your feet or send debris flying. Stick to lower elevations today.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**High River Flows:** Our good old Truckee River is running high due to recent melt. The **Truckee River Parkway** is a fantastic spot, but common sense isn't so common these days, so I'll say it: stay well away from the fast-moving water. One slip, and you're going for a ride you didn't sign up for. Keep kids and dogs on a short leash, or better yet, a totally different park.
</AlertBox>

### Construction & Closures: Business As Usual (Mostly)

I checked for any new, sudden closures, and for the most part, Reno isn't seeing any major *new* workout-impacting construction or events today. The City of Reno's road closures page is always worth a look, but nothing immediately jumped out as affecting your usual running routes within the city for today. No events blocking up the Riverwalk District, thankfully. Just keep an eye out for existing projects, especially west of downtown where the Regional Transportation Commission kicked off some pavement rehab earlier this month.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Tip for Sensitive Lungs:** If you absolutely *must* get outside, try timing your run for earlier in the morning or later in the evening when particulate levels can sometimes be lower, and stick to areas away from traffic or construction dust. And obviously, listen to your body.
