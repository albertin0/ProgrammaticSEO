It’s a decent day to hit the pavement or trails, but don't assume "clear skies" means everything's perfect for your lungs or your footing.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lungs:** While the numbers look "moderate," local air quality advisories are calling it "poor" for sensitive groups today due to ozone. Don't be a hero if you feel it.
*   **Joints & Footing:** Lingering elevated water levels in creeks mean some riverside paths might be slick or partially flooded. Also, construction is gearing up on major routes just outside Reno.
*   **Weather:** Enjoy the relatively mild temps and clear skies now, because another storm system is lurking on the horizon for the weekend.

## Today's Rundown: Clear Skies, Hazy Warnings

You step outside in Reno this morning, and it’s looking pretty clear, with the thermometer hovering around 8.4°C. Perfect running weather, right? Mostly. But a quick check under the hood reveals a few things to keep in mind before you go for that PR.

First, let's talk about that air. Our official AQI number is 71, which usually falls into "moderate" territory. However, some local forecasts are already bumping that up to "poor" for Thursday, specifically warning that the air has reached a high level of pollution and is unhealthy for sensitive groups, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Ozone, as any seasoned runner knows, can be a real pain in the chest, aggravating existing respiratory issues and potentially leading to throat irritation. If you're someone who feels the air quality, maybe scale back that intense speed work today and stick to a steady, easier pace. Don't push it.

## Water Hazards and Construction Creep

The good news is that the heavier showers have diminished in the Sierra, and flooding concerns have *mostly* subsided. However, the National Weather Service in Reno still warns that water flows in area creeks and streams, like the **Truckee River**, will remain elevated through the rest of the week. This means if your usual route takes you along the river path, or near any low-lying areas by a creek, proceed with caution. Some sections could still be wet, muddy, or even have poor drainage flooding, making for slippery conditions or unexpected detours.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step by the Water!** Elevated water levels in the Truckee River and other local creeks mean uneven, muddy, or slick surfaces are possible. Don't go splashing through unknowns.

And just a heads-up if you venture into Sparks: the Pyramid Way resurfacing and improvement project is set to begin on March 1st. While not active *today*, it means that starting very soon, you'll encounter nightly lane reductions and 24/7 shifted, slightly reduced lane widths. Pedestrian detours will also pop up periodically. Plan your longer runs or bike rides accordingly if you typically use that area; it’s going to be a construction zone through spring 2027.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Headed to the Mountains?** Winter conditions persist in higher elevations, like the Tahoe Rim Trail, with deep snow and icy patches possible. If you're hitting the slopes or backcountry, be aware of terrain instability and potential tree wells.
