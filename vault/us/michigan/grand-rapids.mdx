Don't even think about hitting those trails hard today, Grand Rapids. It's a "take it easy or hit the treadmill" kind of morning.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Recent Snowfall:** A burst of snow moved through early this morning, leaving behind poor travel conditions with low visibility and snow-covered roads. Expect slippery surfaces on sidewalks and unplowed paths.</li>
  <li>**Chilly Temps:** While the thermometer might show 2.5°C (37°F), it feels more like -2°C (28°F) out there. That's enough to make your lungs sting if you're not careful.</li>
  <li>**Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is sitting at a moderate 72, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. Keep that in mind, especially if you're sensitive.</li>
  <li>**Low Pollen:** Good news for allergy sufferers, the pollen count is low.</li>
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. We're Michiganders. A little snow isn't going to stop us from getting our miles in along the Grand River Edges Trail. But seriously, this isn't the day to be setting any personal bests, unless your personal best involves not wiping out on black ice. The National Weather Service even warned about snowfall rates of half an inch per hour earlier this morning, leading to "poor travel conditions" and "low visibility." You'll be spending more time looking down at your feet than enjoying the river views.

  ## Watch Your Step (and Your Neck)!
  With the recent snow burst, expect slippery conditions on untreated roads, sidewalks, and especially trails like those around Millennium Park. Black ice is a real hazard when temperatures hover around freezing. Slow your roll, wear appropriate footwear, and consider taking your workout indoors today.

Beyond the immediate weather, keep an eye out for ongoing construction around the city. While specific trail closures for hazards weren't reported in the last 24 hours for Grand Rapids, MI trails, general road work can impact your routes. Major bridge repair projects at the I-196 and US-131 interchange started back in September 2025, and can still cause unexpected detours and traffic headaches. Always check city resources for road closures if your route takes you near major thoroughfares.

  ## Breathe Easy-ish
  An AQI of 72 with Ozone as the main culprit isn't terrible, but it's not ideal. If you're susceptible to respiratory issues, or you're planning a particularly intense session, be mindful of how you're feeling. Listen to your body – it's usually smarter than your training plan.

  ## Layer Up, Buttercup!
  That "feels like" temperature is no joke. Dress in layers, cover exposed skin, and make sure your gear can handle potential slush and lingering moisture. Nobody wants frostbite on their ears or soaked socks two miles in.
</AlertBox>

Stay safe out there, or better yet, stay inside and re-watch some old marathon footage. You earned it.
