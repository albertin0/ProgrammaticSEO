Don't let that "clear" sky fool you, Grand Rapids; it's still a brisk one out there, and frankly, some of our favorite trails are a mess.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today isn't exactly prime time for a PR

<BulletList>
*   **Brutal wind chill:** The thermometer might hover around freezing (-0.5°C), but with average winds hitting 15 mph and gusts up to a whopping 31 mph, it feels a lot more like 18°F (-7.8°C) out there. That's cold enough to make you question your life choices halfway through your run.
*   **Moderate air quality:** Our AQI is sitting at a moderate 66, with inhalable particulate matter being the dominant pollutant. While not terrible, it's not exactly "champagne air" for your lungs, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   **Construction chaos:** Forget a clear path; major chunks of our beloved trail system are under construction, rerouting your usual zen run into a frustrating detour.

### Grand Rapids, It's Winter, Act Like It

Okay, so the sun's out, and it's tempting to think "Spring is around the corner!" But this is Michigan, folks, and February's just pulling a fast one on you. The actual temperature is hovering just below freezing, but the wind is the real gut punch. AccuWeather pegs the "RealFeel" at a chilly 18°F (-7.8°C) today, with gusts that could knock your hat off. Seriously, this isn't the day to break out the short sleeves. Layer up, cover your skin, and if you feel that familiar burning in your lungs from the cold, it's time to slow your roll or call it a day. Frostbite and hypothermia are no joke, even when the sky looks innocent.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Don't Underestimate the Wind Chill!
A clear sky doesn't mean it's warm. Today's "RealFeel" temperature is significantly colder than the actual air temperature due to sustained winds and gusts up to 31 mph. Protect all exposed skin!

### Trail Trouble Ahead

Planning a long run or ride? Double-check your route. It seems every beloved path in Grand Rapids is getting some "enhancements" right now, which is great for the future, but a pain in the glutes today.

The **Musketawa Trail**, a favorite for logging serious miles, has a hefty 12-mile section closed down for a two-year reconstruction project. That means bridge replacements, repaving, and tree clearing are going to keep the Marne and Conklin trailheads shut through most of 2026. If that was your go-to, you're looking at a significant reroute.

Down by the river, the **Grand River Edges Trail** between Leonard and Ann streets is also kicking off construction this winter (which, last I checked, is *now*). They're building a new 12-foot wide multi-use trail, aiming to finally link downtown to Riverside Park. Again, great news eventually, but expect detours and disruptions if you're trying to connect those dots today. Crahen Valley Park and the Oxford Trail are also undergoing significant projects through 2026.

### Trail Closures Galore!
Large sections of the Musketawa Trail are closed for two years, and the Grand River Edges Trail (Leonard to Ann) is starting construction now. Plan your routes carefully to avoid unexpected dead ends.

### Your Lungs Aren't Loving It Either

While pollen is low, the Air Quality Index is currently moderate at 66, primarily due to inhalable particulate matter. [User data] This isn't red-alert territory, but it's enough to notice if you're pushing a strenuous workout. If you've got any respiratory sensitivities, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to some indoor hills today.

### AQI: Moderate Means "Take it Easy"
With a moderate AQI of 66 and fine particulate matter in the air, consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors, especially if you're sensitive. [User data]
