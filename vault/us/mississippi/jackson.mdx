Alright, Jackson, today's not a terrible day to get your miles in, but don't just blindly trust those clear skies.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is sitting at 59, which is "Moderate," and the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). That’s not your friend, especially if you’ve got sensitive lungs or plan on pushing the pace. Basically, it’s tiny crap floating in the air, and you don't want it deep in your respiratory system.
*   The Mississippi Forestry Commission has us at a "High Risk of Fire" today. While there aren't any massive infernos eating up our local green space in the last 24 hours that I could find, dry conditions mean it wouldn't take much for something to kick off, and even distant smoke can travel. PM10, remember? That’s smoke.
*   Pollen count is finally low, so at least your nose won't be staging a full-on rebellion, which is a small victory for us allergy-sufferers.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The sun's out, the temperature is a crisp 9°C this morning, heading up to a lovely 24°C later. Perfect running weather on paper, right? But paper doesn't account for what you're actually breathing in. Take a jaunt down the Pearl River Greenway near LeFleur's Bluff State Park, and you might feel it more than you think. What feels like a good, hard effort could just be your lungs working overtime to filter out microscopic junk.

### Air Quality & Your Lungs: A Reality Check

The AQI of 59 means it's generally okay for most folks, but if you're particularly sensitive, or prone to respiratory issues, that particulate matter is going to be an irritant. We've seen how lingering issues, like that South Jackson tire fire from last year, can affect air quality in the long run. While that specific blaze is old news, the general risk of airborne particles is always something to consider in an urban environment, especially when fire risk is elevated.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch for the Haze, Pay Attention to Your Chest:** Even if you can't see a thick haze, the "Moderate" AQI with PM10 as the dominant pollutant means there are tiny particles in the air. If you start feeling any chest tightness, unusual coughing, or shortness of breath, cut your workout short. Your lungs are trying to tell you something.

### Local Buzz & Trail Updates

Speaking of the Pearl River, the big news this week is that the Pearl River flood control project finally got the green light on Thursday, February 26th. Don't get too excited about new running trails or revamped riverfront views just yet; this thing is still in the "intensive design and engineering process" and construction isn't slated to start until late 2026 or early 2027. So, no detours or construction blockages *today* related to that, but it's a reminder of how our city's landscape is always in flux.

Also, for those of you looking for races, today is the "Breaking the Loop" event out in Brandon. It's not *in* Jackson, but if you're heading out there, expect some local traffic. Otherwise, most of our primary running spots are clear of organized events today that would cause major blockages.

**Hydrate, Even When It's Cool:** With the temperature climbing to the mid-70s later, it's easy to get complacent. Start hydrating now. Just because it's not scorching doesn't mean you can skip the water.
</AlertBox>

So, go for it if you're feeling good, but don't be a hero. Listen to your body, maybe opt for a slightly shorter or less intense run if your lungs feel iffy, and keep an eye on those changing conditions.
