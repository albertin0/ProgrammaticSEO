Forget those pristine 'clear skies' you think you see, Jackson, because today's a gamble for your lungs and a potential pain for your head (literally, with hail warnings).

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   Don't let that initial sunshine fool you; the National Weather Service is calling for isolated severe storms across Central Mississippi later this afternoon into early this evening, potentially packing hail. Seriously, who wants to outrun a hailstorm at LeFleur's Bluff?
*   The air quality sits at a 'moderate' 68 AQI, with inhalable particulate matter being the main culprit. Not exactly prime breathing for pushing the pace, even if the pollen count is finally playing nice.
*   Oh, and there's a 40% chance of rain today in Hinds County, ramping up to 85% tonight. So, that planned run could turn into a soggy slip-and-slide real quick.
</BulletList>

## Today's Vitals (and Why You Should Care)

The weather data you might be seeing out there could be a bit misleading. While it might *look* clear right now, the local forecast for Hinds County, where we actually live and breathe (or try to), points to a 40% chance of rain today, turning into an 85% chance tonight. More importantly, the NWS is throwing out warnings for isolated severe storms and possible hail. You know what that means for your outdoor plans: reconsider, folks. Nobody needs a concussion from a rogue ice chunk when they're just trying to get their miles in.

Then there's the air. A moderate AQI of 68 isn't going to kill you, but that dominant pollutant being inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) is just enough to make your lungs feel a bit grimy during a hard effort. This isn't the day to try for a PR, especially with the storm risk looming. Save that gas for a day when the air isn't actively trying to make you cough up a lung.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers, at least. Low pollen means one less thing trying to take you down while you're out there. Just don't let it give you a false sense of security about the rest of the environmental stew.

## Local Alerts & Hot Takes

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Severe Storms & Hail Warning:** The biggest threat today is the potential for isolated severe storms with hail late this afternoon and early evening. If you hear thunder or see ominous clouds, get inside. No run is worth a trip to the ER.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Soggy Conditions Ahead:** With a 40% chance of rain today and higher odds tonight, trails around places like LeFleur's Bluff State Park could get slick. Watch your footing, especially on roots and paved areas that collect water.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Continues:** Keep an eye out for potential lane closures on state routes. MDOT reports alternating lane closures daily from 6 AM to 6 PM on MS 471 between I-20 and MS 25 due to road work. While not a full blockage, it can make crossing or running near busy roads more hazardous. If you're running that stretch, be extra vigilant.
</AlertBox>

Honestly, today feels like a treadmill day. Or maybe a "Lagers and Joggers" event at Fertile Ground Beer Co. later tonight, but only if they've got good indoor space and a solid severe weather plan. If you absolutely must hit the pavement, keep it short, stay hyper-aware of the sky, and carry your phone. Your physical therapist (me) would rather you be bored on a bike indoors than sidelined with an injury from a storm or a slippery trail.
