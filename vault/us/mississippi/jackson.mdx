Alright, Jackson, look outside. If you thought you were getting a clear, crisp run today, think again – the skies are playing a different tune.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Rain on the Horizon (or already here):** Despite what some apps might say, the National Weather Service is calling for rain, which means slick roads and potentially muddy trails.
*   **Ozone's in the Air:** Our AQI is sitting at a moderate 68, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Most of us will be fine, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel it.
*   **Pollen's Taking a Break:** Good news for your sinuses, folks. The pollen count is low, so no sneezing your way through your mile repeats.

## Today's Outdoor Workout Rundown: Dodging Drops and Breathing Deep

So, you geared up for a run along the Museum Trail, maybe a brisk walk through LeFleur's Bluff State Park, and now the forecast is looking less "clear skies" and more "puddle jumping." The NWS forecast for Jackson today, February 26th, is predicting light to moderate rain throughout the day. This isn't August 2022 levels of Pearl River flooding, but it's enough to make you reconsider your fancy new carbon plates.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Slick Surfaces & Reduced Visibility Ahead
With rain expected, roads, sidewalks, and especially trails will be slick. Expect reduced visibility if it really starts coming down. Watch your footing, especially around corners and on uneven terrain. This isn't the day to PR your downhill segments. Also, drivers tend to be even *less* aware of runners in the rain, so assume you're invisible.
</AlertBox>

On the air quality front, we're holding steady at a Moderate AQI of 68, primarily due to ozone. For the average runner, this is generally acceptable. However, if you're asthmatic or have other respiratory issues, pay attention to how you feel. Don't push it if you start coughing or experiencing shortness of breath. There are no major wildfire smoke events impacting us directly right now, which is a silver lining.

### Pollen Report: A Brief Respite

For those of us who usually spend half our run wiping snot off our face, today's a win. The pollen level is low. Enjoy it while it lasts, because we all know how quickly that changes around here.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

### What's Up Around Town?

Construction on the next phase of the Museum Trail, extending it behind the Old Capitol Museum and Hal & Mal's, is slated to kick off in March. So, while it's not impacting your run *today*, keep an eye out for future reroutes and dust once that gets going. Always a good time for infrastructure improvements, right?

Also, shout out to the "Lagers and Joggers" event happening today. If you're participating, stay hydrated – with water, before the lagers, obviously – and mind the wet conditions. It's a great way to stay active, but the weather requires extra caution.

### PT's Two Cents: Mind Your Gait in the Rain
If you're still heading out, shorten your stride slightly and increase your cadence. This helps improve traction and reduces the impact on your joints when landing on wet surfaces. Also, consider shoes with better grip. Nobody wants to end up at the ER with a sprained ankle just because they had to get their miles in. Be smart.
