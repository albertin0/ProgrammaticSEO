Forget that "winter wonderland" nonsense, Anchorage. Today is a day to reconsider if your lungs can handle being flash-frozen to your ribs.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
*   Ambient temperatures are brutally cold at -24.7°C, with wind chill making it feel even worse, creating a serious frostbite risk in minutes.
*   Moderate air quality with inhalable particulate matter means your lungs will be working overtime to filter frosty, dirty air.
*   While trails like those at Kincaid Park are groomed, the cold makes conditions hard-packed and unforgiving if you fall.
</BulletList>

## The Deep Freeze Is Real

Let's be blunt: it's absolutely freezing out there today. The thermometer says -24.7°C (that's about -12°F for those still in denial), but with even a whisper of wind, it'll feel like -30°C to -34°C (-23°F to -30°F). The National Weather Service in Anchorage even issued an "Extreme Cold Watch" for parts of the region that was in effect until this evening, warning of dangerously cold wind chills that could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 to 20 minutes. Seriously, don't mess around with those numbers. Your skin, nose, and any exposed bit will thank you for staying inside.

The Nordic Skiing Association of Anchorage reported yesterday that trails like the popular loops at Kincaid Park were groomed, but noted it was "noticeably colder out there" and to "bundle up, manage expectations, and enjoy your time on the snow." That "bundle up" part is an understatement when your breath is literally turning into ice crystals mid-air.

## What's in the Air?

While the biggest immediate threat is the cold, don't forget about what you're actually breathing.

| Pollen Level | AQI Score | Dominant Pollutant                |
| :----------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Low          | 73        | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) |

An AQI of 73 might sound "moderate," but when it's this cold, those inhalable particulate matters (PM10) can feel a lot worse on your airways. Your body is already working hard to warm the air you breathe; adding fine dust or other irritants to the mix is just asking for a cough or worse. If you have any kind of respiratory sensitivity, this combination is a hard pass.

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### Frostbite Risk: Immediate and Severe
With wind chills making it feel like -30°C or colder, exposed skin can get frostbite in minutes. Your fingers, toes, ears, and nose are especially vulnerable. Seriously, skip the outdoor heroics today.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Lung Irritation
The moderate AQI with PM10 as the dominant pollutant, combined with extreme cold, means your lungs will be struggling. If you must go out, cover your mouth and nose with a scarf or balaclava to warm and filter the air.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
#### Layer Up (Or Don't Go Out)
If you absolutely *must* be outside, think multiple, loose layers, especially over your core, head, hands, and feet. Wool or synthetics are your friends. Cotton is a one-way ticket to hypothermia in this weather. And bring a buddy.
</AlertBox>

In short, unless you're a seasoned ice-marathoner with all the right gear, today is a fantastic day to hit the treadmill, the pool, or just chill out with a hot cup of coffee. Your body will thank you.
