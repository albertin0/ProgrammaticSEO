It's one of those days in Pasadena where you *could* get a decent run in, but don't expect a perfect stroll through the park without a few caveats.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The weather is playing nice, finally. Clear skies and a comfortable 20.3°C means you won't be melting into the pavement or shivering your way around.
*   Pollen is low, so your sinuses can take a much-needed break from the usual Houston-area assault. Breathe easy, buttercup.
*   However, don't get cocky. Our air quality isn't exactly pristine, with moderate ozone levels hanging around. Your lungs are technically safe, but if you're sensitive, you might feel it.
</BulletList>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Ozone Alert for the Sensitive Runners

That AQI of 73? It means ozone is our dominant pollutant. For most of us, it's just a bit hazy. But if you're prone to respiratory issues, or if you're planning an intense, long-duration workout, you might want to dial it back a notch. Keep an eye on how you feel; this isn't the day to PR your mile if your chest feels tight.
</AlertBox>

Alright, let's talk trails. The pavement on places like the Patrick Ferry Park loop is probably fine, but if you're eyeing our beloved bayou greenways, a word of caution. While there's no *new* flooding or major closures reported today, let's just say our local trails, particularly around areas like **Clark Henry Park** and the Vince Bayou Greenway, have a history of being... temperamental. Back in September 2024, parts of the trail near Clark Henry Park were reportedly washed out and blocked by construction. Even if today's clear skies mean no *fresh* washouts, these trails are often susceptible to erosion and patchy conditions. Don't assume smooth sailing just because the sun's out. You know what they say: Houston weather giveth, and then it immediately taketh away your trail stability.

### Hydration, Even When It's "Nice"

Just because it's not sweltering doesn't mean you can skip the water bottle. Texas humidity always finds a way to sneak up on you, even on a clear, 20-degree day. Stay hydrated, especially if you're hitting those longer routes or pushing the pace.
</AlertBox>

Also, if you're thinking of venturing a bit further, remember that major construction projects are a constant companion in our neck of the woods. For instance, the White Oak Bayou Greenway, a bit north in Houston, has closures due to IH-45/I-10 connector ramp work that started in January 2026 and are expected to last through 2028. While not directly in Pasadena, it's a good reminder that if you're driving to another trail system, double-check those TxDOT alerts. There's always some lane reduction or ramp closure somewhere.

Overall, it's a decent day to get out there. The good news is the low pollen count and comfortable temperature. The bad news is the moderate AQI for sensitive folks, and the perennial "check the damn trail yourself" warning for our bayou paths. Lace up, be smart, and maybe stick to the paved stuff if you're feeling lazy about dodging eroded sections.
