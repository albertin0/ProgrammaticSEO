Alright, El Paso, you wanna hit the pavement today? Fine, but don't come crying to me about your lungs.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Dusty AF:** Those "breezy" conditions forecasters keep chirping about? Yeah, they're kicking up enough Chihuahuan Desert dust to make your lungs feel like sandpaper. With wind gusts up to 40 mph and blowing dust cutting visibility, your AQI is sitting in the "Moderate" zone, thanks to inhalable particulate matter. If you're planning a run up Transmountain Road, expect a free exfoliating treatment for your airways.</li>
  <li>**Heat is ON:** It's February, but El Paso decided to go full summer. We're looking at highs in the mid-80s today, pushing into near-record territory for the weekend. That might sound nice for lounging, but for a solid workout, it means extra sweat, extra dehydration risk, and generally feeling like you're running in a convection oven.</li>
  <li>**Construction Chaos Continues:** TxDOT is still at it, with I-10 widening projects and lane closures affecting sections from Redd to Mesa, and along North and South Desert. If your usual route involves any frontage roads or overpasses, double-check the closures or be prepared for detours. Nothing like an unexpected construction zone to kill your stride.</li>
</BulletList>

## Today's Hot Takes & Hazards:

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### Blowing Dust & AQI
  The AQI is currently 57, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. The gusty west winds, reaching up to 40 mph, are stirring up significant dust. This isn't just a nuisance; it's a genuine respiratory irritant. If you've got asthma, allergies, or just a general aversion to coughing up dirt, seriously reconsider your outdoor plans, especially during peak wind hours. Doctors are already warning about allergy flare-ups with these conditions.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ### Elevated Wildfire Risk
  Thanks to low humidity, dry air, and those lovely gusty winds, the fire weather conditions are elevated. There was a brush fire on West Paisano just a couple of days ago. Be extremely mindful of anything that could spark a flame, especially if you're out on any of the dry trails. This isn't the time to flick your half-smoked cigarette butt into the brush, you heathen.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  ### Hydration is Non-Negotiable
  With temperatures in the mid-80s, you'll be sweating more than you think. Don't just bring water; bring *more* water than you think you need. Consider an electrolyte drink, especially for longer efforts. Heat stress is real, and it sneaks up on you quicker in dry heat.
