Today? If you think "clear and warm" means "go wild," you're forgetting where you live. This isn't the day for heroics, El Paso.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky is packing a moderate AQI thanks to inhalable particulate matter, which strong westerly winds up to 25 mph (with higher gusts, naturally) will happily whip into your lungs.
*   Brush fire risk is pegged at "Extreme" today, meaning that moderate AQI could turn nasty with little warning, especially with those winds.
*   While the temperature is a pleasant 27.6°C (81.7°F), combine that with the dry air and strong winds, and dehydration can sneak up on you faster than a roadrunner on a mission.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The sun's out, the sky's blue, and you're itching to hit the trails. But let's be real about what's actually happening out there. That "moderate" air quality isn't just a number; it means there's enough particulate matter floating around to make your lungs work harder than they should, especially when you're sucking wind on a climb. And those gusts? They're not just messing with your hair; they're stirring up all that dust and grit that makes El Paso charmingly... arid.

If you're planning on tackling anything in the Franklin Mountains State Park, think twice about pushing for a PR. Reservations are recommended anyway, so maybe use that as an excuse to reschedule if your lungs aren't feeling 100%. If you absolutely *must* get out, consider an earlier start before the winds really pick up, or keep it short and sweet around Memorial Park instead of a full mountain assault.

### Mind the Wind & Fire Risk
Strong westerly winds (15-25 mph, with higher gusts) are predicted for today, significantly increasing the "Extreme Risk of Fire" in the area. A brush fire was being tackled just yesterday near W. Paisano, so stay vigilant and report any smoke immediately.

### Construction Chaos Continues
If you're driving to any outdoor spots, be aware of the constant construction on major arteries. TxDOT is still hard at work on the I-10 Widening West Project with nightly closures expected, including this evening on I-10 eastbound between Vinton/Westway and Artcraft. Plan your routes and expect delays. Seriously, expect them.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### AQI: Don't Breathe Deeply
An AQI of 56 might sound okay, but with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant and strong winds, your respiratory system is on notice. If you have any lung conditions or feel generally off, listen to your body. Today might be better suited for an indoor workout or just a very gentle stroll.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, folks. I'm a PT, not your mom, but I see enough busted knees and overworked lungs to know when to pull back. Today's one of those days.
