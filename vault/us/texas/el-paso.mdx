If you're looking for a sign to hit the trails today, this is it – but keep your eyes peeled for ongoing roadwork.

<LungsJointsScore score={8} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air quality is stellar:** With an AQI of 10 and low pollen counts, your lungs are getting a treat today. Breathe deep, El Paso.
*   **Weather's a winner:** A clear sky and a comfortable 20.9°C (around 70°F) make for near-perfect running weather.
*   **Wind might kick up:** KVIA's forecast mentions "Warm, Windy, Wednesday," so expect some gusts later in the day, especially if you're out on exposed routes.

## The Good, The Bad, and The Dusty

Today is shaping up to be one of those glorious El Paso days for outdoor activity. The air is clean, the temperatures are ideal, and the sun is out, meaning less sneezing and more breathing for everyone. Seriously, a low pollen count and an AQI of 10? That's about as good as it gets in the desert.

However, it wouldn't be El Paso without some traffic and construction. Our city is in a constant state of improvement (or so they say), and right now, that means a lot of ongoing road projects that could affect your routes, especially if you drive to your favorite spots or run near major arteries.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Metro Mess: I-10 and Loop 375 Construction Continues

Expect significant delays and closures, particularly along **I-10 and Loop 375**. The I-10 Widening West Project is still in full swing, with various daily and nightly lane closures, detours, and crews working on everything from sweeping to striping and bridge painting. For instance, the eastbound I-10 between Redd and Mesa is slated for nightly closures today. Similarly, the Loop 375 (Purple Heart Highway) Widening Project, including the Sergeant Major Bridge Reconstruction Project, has continuous closures until March 2026. If your route takes you anywhere near these areas, be prepared for uneven surfaces, dust, and increased traffic. Stay vigilant, assume drivers aren't paying attention, and consider alternative routes on surface streets or dedicated trails further from the freeway.

### Pollen Breakdown (Not Applicable Today, But Good to Know)

While today's pollen is thankfully low, for future reference, here's what typically plagues us.

| Pollen Type | Level (Today) | Typical High Season |
| :---------- | :------------ | :------------------ |
| Trees       | Low           | Spring              |
| Grass       | Low           | Spring/Summer       |
| Weeds       | Low           | Late Summer/Fall    |

### Trail Cautions Beyond the Pavement

For those heading to the mountains, remember last week's rescue in **Franklin Mountains State Park** on the Mammoth Rock Trail where a hiker fell about 150 feet. While the conditions are great, the mountains are no joke. Know your limits, wear appropriate footwear, carry water, and tell someone where you're going. It's easy to get complacent on a beautiful day, but the desert can still bite.

### Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate!

Even with pleasant temperatures, El Paso is dry. Stay ahead of dehydration, especially with potential winds, and carry more water than you think you'll need.
