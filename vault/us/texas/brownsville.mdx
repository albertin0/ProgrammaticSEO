Alright, Brownsville, get ready to navigate a bit of a mixed bag if you're hitting the streets or trails today.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Downtown Lockdown:** Charro Days parades and the Sombrero Festival are shutting down major arteries and parks, especially around Historic Downtown Brownsville and Washington Park. Forget your usual Elizabeth Street sprint.
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** AQI is clocking in at 61, which is "moderate," but the dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter. That's the stuff that gets deep in your lungs, potentially from distant wildfires or local sources you can't see.
*   **Construction Zone Ahead (and everywhere):** Ongoing road construction on International Boulevard and State Highway 4 means detours and uneven surfaces. Don't expect smooth sailing if your route takes you near these areas.
</BulletList>

Look, I love Charro Days as much as the next local, but it's a nightmare for an uninterrupted run. With the Grand International Parade kicking off at 10 AM on Elizabeth Street and International Boulevard, and Washington Park basically being a festival ground all weekend, you can forget about hitting those downtown routes. Plan your mileage away from the festivities unless you enjoy dodging churro stands and parade floats.

The weather itself is pretty clear today, hitting a pleasant 20.7°C (69°F) this morning and warming up to around 28°C (82°F) later. Low pollen is a win. But that "moderate" AQI with fine particulate matter is still a yellow flag. Even if you don't feel it now, consistent exposure to that stuff isn't doing your lungs any favors. And yes, a Dense Fog Advisory was in effect for early morning in our coastal areas and bays, which could have made visibility tricky if you were out super early near the resacas.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch for Traffic & Closures:** Seriously, with Charro Days in full swing, downtown Brownsville is a maze of road closures. Check local updates before you head out, and consider hitting trails further afield to avoid the chaos. The area around Washington Park, in particular, is off-limits for workouts until early March.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Consider the West Rail Trail:** While improvements are planned for the 6.6-mile West Rail Trail (including parking and restrooms), it might be a better bet today for space away from the parade routes. Just be mindful of any current work if you venture out there.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**AQI & Breathing:** An AQI of 61 with fine particulate matter means sensitive groups might experience respiratory symptoms. If you have asthma or other lung conditions, err on the side of caution. Maybe today's the day for an indoor workout or a shorter, slower outdoor session. The air isn't exactly crisp.
