Don't let that sunshine fool you, Frisco – today is a pretty rough day for your lungs if you're planning an outdoor sweat session.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   High pollen count means your sinuses are going to hate you, even if you don't typically "get" allergies.
*   "Moderate" AQI with fine particulate matter? That's code for "your lungs are working overtime to filter out tiny crap" which isn't ideal for a heavy workout.
*   Construction around Lebanon Road will add extra dust and detours to your usual routes, so be ready to improvise or get frustrated.

## Environmental Breakdown

### Pollen Alert

| Pollen Level | Dominant Types | Impact |
| :----------- | :------------- | :----- |
| High         | &mdash;        | Significant risk for allergy sufferers; can affect anyone with prolonged exposure. |

### Air Quality Index (AQI)

| AQI Level | Dominant Pollutant              | Health Advisory                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :-------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 67 (Moderate) | Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) | Air quality is generally acceptable for most individuals. However, sensitive groups may experience minor to moderate symptoms from long-term exposure. Reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion if you're in a sensitive group or experiencing symptoms. |

### Weather Report

It's a clear, warm day out there, clocking in at a pleasant 25.1°C (77.2°F). The clear skies are inviting, but don't let the nice weather distract you from the less visible hazards.

## Today's Workout Hazards

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Double Whammy: High Pollen & Moderate PM2.5
Your respiratory system is under assault today. Not only are the trees dumping pollen like it's their job, but the air quality is also rocking a moderate AQI thanks to fine particulate matter. This stuff gets deep into your lungs. If you're asthmatic, have seasonal allergies, or just generally enjoy breathing, seriously consider moving your run indoors or keeping it super short and low intensity. Don't be a hero; your lungs will thank you.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Construction Chaos on Lebanon Road
Heads up, runners and cyclists! The city's still plugging away at widening Lebanon Road, and that means intermittent blockages are in effect between Teel Parkway and Lone Star Ranch Parkway. Expect delays and detours, especially if you're out between 9 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. That also means more dust and exhaust fumes to contend with, adding to your respiratory burden. Maybe take the paved trails around Frisco Commons Park today instead, but even there, stay vigilant for local construction noise bleeding over.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today is one of those days where the weather looks great, but the air and ground conditions are conspiring against a truly enjoyable outdoor workout. If you insist on hitting the pavement or trails, keep it mellow, hydrate like it's your job, and bring a tissue box.
