If you're dead set on getting outside today, Frisco, you're going to be fighting for every breath, but at least your joints will appreciate the mild temps.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   That "Very High" pollen count isn't just a suggestion, it's a full-on assault on your respiratory system.
*   AQI hitting "Moderate" with Nitrogen dioxide as the star pollutant means even without the pollen, your lungs are working overtime.
*   Gorgeous, clear 16.2°C weather means your muscles and joints get a reprieve from extreme temps, which is a rare win.
</BulletList>

Look, the weather gods finally decided to be nice, giving us a beautiful, clear day at 16.2°C. That's fantastic for keeping the body from overheating or freezing, and it certainly makes the pavement more inviting than a treadmill. Your knees and hips are probably thanking you just thinking about it. But don't let those blue skies fool you; this isn't a free pass for a carefree long run.

### Air Quality & Pollen Report

| Pollutant           | Level       |
| :------------------ | :---------- |
| **Overall AQI**     | 72 (Moderate) |
| **Dominant Pollutant** | Nitrogen dioxide |
| **Pollen**          | Very High   |

<AlertBox type="danger">
Seriously, folks, the pollen is doing its absolute best to recreate a scene from "The Happening" for your lungs. With a "Very High" rating, every breath is going to feel like you're inhaling a cloud of tiny, irritating allergens. If you have asthma, allergies, or any kind of respiratory sensitivity, this is a day to reconsider pushing it hard outdoors. Even if you don't, you're going to feel it. Add that on top of a "Moderate" AQI, with Nitrogen dioxide as the main culprit, and your airways are under a double assault. Nitrous oxides are no joke for respiratory health, especially during sustained exertion.

### Local Construction & Trail Status

Construction is still the unofficial state bird of Frisco, so expect some detours if you're hitting your usual spots. While the city's official site doesn't list any major *new* trail closures in the last 24 hours, remember the ongoing extension work on the **Cottonwood Creek Trail** under the Dallas North Tollway. If that's part of your route, expect some dusty sections or alternative paths. It's an "in progress" situation, so things change. Always assume some disruption.

Also, be aware of significant downtown redevelopment. 5th Street between Main and Elm Streets remains closed until Monday morning, March 2, for underground utility work. So if your route takes you through the **Rail District**, plan accordingly. You don't want to add unnecessary mileage because you ran into a "ROAD CLOSED" sign you could have avoided.

<AlertBox type="info">
Hydrate aggressively if you're determined to brave the pollen and AQI. Shower and change immediately after your workout to get that pollen off your skin and out of your hair. And for the love of all that is holy, don't forget to wash those workout clothes!
</AlertBox>

No crazy wind advisories or wildfire threats were reported for today, which is a small mercy, especially after North Texas saw gusty winds and high fire danger earlier this week. But this is Texas, so always keep an eye on the sky.

Honestly, if you're chasing PRs today, you're probably chasing an asthma attack right alongside it. If you absolutely *must* run, take it easy, cut your mileage, and listen to your body. Or just hit the gym, you know, like a smart person.
