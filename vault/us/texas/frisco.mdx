Today? You *can* get outside in Frisco, but you'll be dodging allergens and road cones.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Pollen is high, so your lungs might not thank you if you're sensitive.
*   Moderate ozone levels mean you might want to adjust those intense intervals.
*   Construction around major roads like Lebanon is going to mess with your usual routes.
</BulletList>

Look, the weather today is pretty sweet for February 26th. We’re talking clear skies and a comfortable 16.9°C (that’s about 62°F for those of you not on the metric system yet). That usually screams "get out there and hit the trails!" But hold your horses, because Frisco always has a few curveballs.

First up, that invisible enemy: **pollen**. It’s high today, which means if you’re one of the many unlucky souls in North Texas with seasonal allergies, your long run might turn into a snotty slog. Pair that with a Moderate Air Quality Index (AQI) of 71, with ozone as the dominant pollutant, and your lungs might feel like they're working overtime even if you're just cruising. If you’re prone to respiratory issues, take it easy. Maybe opt for an indoor session or keep your outdoor workout short and less intense. No PRs are worth a week of wheezing.

### Roadwork Ruckus

Now, for the physical hazards. Frisco is *always* under construction, and today is no different. The city’s "Weekly Roadwork Roundup" is a perpetual source of headaches for runners and cyclists.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Expect intermittent blockages on **westbound Lebanon Road** between Teel Parkway and Lone Star Ranch Parkway. These closures are happening from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and are expected to wrap up by Friday afternoon, February 27. If Lebanon is part of your route, you're going to hit detours. Plan accordingly, maybe reroute to Stonebrook Parkway.
</AlertBox>

And if you were thinking of hitting up **Frisco Commons Park** for a workout that involves the playground or baseball fields, think again. The playground and baseball field are closed for safety due to construction expected to finish by the end of February 2026. So, while the trails *around* the park might be open, don't count on using those specific amenities. You'll probably hear some heavy machinery, too, which isn't exactly peak serenity.

<AlertBox type="info">
Always check the city's official traffic updates before heading out, especially if your route takes you through downtown. 5th Street, for instance, is closed between Main and Elm Streets until February 27 for utility work. Don't assume your usual path is clear.

Yeah, it's that time of year where everything tries to kill your sinuses.

So, while it's a beautiful day temperature-wise, tread carefully, Frisco. Your lungs, knees, and sanity will thank you.
