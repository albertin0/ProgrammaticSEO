Alright, Grand Prairie, today is absolutely *not* the day to forget your antihistamines, or your brain.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The pollen count is officially in "hell no" territory. We're talking "Very High" with cedar, juniper, elm, and ash all having a party at your sinuses' expense.</li>
  <li>Air quality is just "okay." An AQI of 68 with nitrogen dioxide as the star pollutant means it's not ideal, especially when you're sucking wind on those hills.</li>
  <li>Construction in downtown is really picking up. If you're planning on navigating Main Street or Jefferson Street, expect detours, dust, and general chaos.</li>
</BulletList>

Look, the weather's clear and a comfortable 15.9°C (around 61°F), which sounds great on paper. But for us runners, "clear" often means "clear for pollen to fly directly into your face." Today, that's exactly what's happening. The pollen index is a whopping 10.2, and it's expected to climb higher. If you've got even a hint of seasonal allergies, your lungs are going to feel like you've run through a field of cottonwood trees after about five minutes on the Walnut Creek Paddling Trail loop. Don't say I didn't warn you.

As for the air quality, an AQI of 68 isn't terrible, but it's not great either. The dominant pollutant is nitrogen dioxide, which isn't exactly a lung-friendly cocktail when you're pushing your pace. Take it easy, especially if you're sensitive.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Downtown Grand Prairie is a construction zone.**
  Major revitalization projects are kicking into gear. Site prep at the former Calvary Church is ongoing, and Main Street (from NW 6th to NE 5th Street) will see full roadway reconstruction and pedestrian improvements starting this winter. Jefferson Street is also getting a facelift from State Highway 161 to Cimmaron Trail, starting in the spring. If your route takes you anywhere near these areas, plan for significant detours and increased vehicle traffic. Widened sidewalks are coming, eventually, but for now, it's a mess.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Consider an indoor workout.**
  Seriously, The Epic has some solid indoor options. They just upgraded their basketball courts, and while not a trail, it'll keep you moving without the pollen assault or dodging construction cones. Your sinuses will thank you.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Regional Wildfire Smoke Threat.**
  While not *in* Grand Prairie, there are "Red Flag Warnings" and ongoing wildfires raging across the Plains in South Central Texas. Keep an eye on the sky; smoke can travel further than you think and can quickly degrade air quality, making outdoor exercise risky.
</AlertBox>

So, if you absolutely *must* run outside today, keep it shorter, check for airborne particulate matter if you can, and for the love of all that is holy, take your allergy meds *before* you step out the door. Otherwise, maybe hit the treadmill and save your lungs for a less irritating day.
