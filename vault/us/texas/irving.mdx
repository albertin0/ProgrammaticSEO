Alright, Irving, let's cut to the chase. If you're planning to hit the trails today, you better love breathing pollen and dodging construction, because that's the vibe.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is *not* the day (unless you're an allergy-proof robot)

<BulletList>
*   **Pollen Apocalypse:** We're talking "Very High" pollen levels out there. Your sinuses will stage a full-blown rebellion if you try anything strenuous.
*   **Mediocre Air Quality:** An AQI of 70 means the air is only "Moderate," with Nitrogen dioxide as the dominant pollutant. Throw in some lingering smoke aerosols from scattered burning activities across Texas, and your lungs are going to feel like they're running through a dusty attic.
*   **Construction Zone Ahead (and behind, and to the side):** Don't even think about a smooth run near the Alan-A-Dale bridge. That thing's been closed since September for demolition and drainage work as part of the West Irving Creek Construction Project, and it's not reopening until fall 2027. Parts of Northwest Park are also undergoing renovations. Good luck with that.
</BulletList>

Today's clear, 16.2°C (61°F) weather might *look* inviting, but it's a trap. The air is deceptively poor for anyone with a respiratory system that isn't made of steel. While your joints might appreciate the mild temperatures, your lungs will be cursing you.

### Current Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level (Irving, TX) |
| :---------- | :----------------- |
| Overall     | Very High          |

<AlertBox type="warning">
Your nose and throat are going to hate you today. With pollen at "Very High" and an AQI hovering in the "Moderate" zone, sensitive individuals should absolutely reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. Don't be a hero; your airways aren't impressed.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, if you must get outside, stick to a walk, maybe a light jog. If you plan on tackling the Campión Trails, understand that while the main paths might be clear of physical obstacles, the air itself is your adversary. And if your route takes you anywhere near the West Irving Creek area, consider it a no-go zone due to ongoing construction.

<AlertBox type="danger">
Avoid the Alan-A-Dale bridge area like it's a surprise hill repeat. It's closed for demolition and won't be back for a *long* time. Trying to navigate construction zones with heavy machinery and restricted access is an injury waiting to happen. There's also a lane closure on W. Pioneer Drive for water line installation, which could mess with your road routes.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. Even if you're just taking it easy, the combination of allergens and pollutants means your body will be working harder than usual. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after any outdoor activity.
</AlertBox>

If you're an allergy sufferer, or if your lungs feel anything less than perfect, today's the day for the treadmill or some indoor strength work. Your body will thank you later. Or, you know, just sit on the couch and binge-watch something. No judgment here.
