Alright, Plano, look, today's one of those days where your lungs are gonna hate you, but the rest of you might actually enjoy getting outside if you play it smart.

<LungsJointsScore score={5.5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Pollen Apocalypse:** We're hitting "High" for pollen levels. If your nose runs more than a faucet or your eyes itch like crazy, you know the drill.
*   **Ozone's Back:** AQI is moderate at 71 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not terrible, but enough to make those deep breaths a little less refreshing, especially if you're sensitive.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Seriously, try driving anywhere without hitting a cone. Road and trail construction are still a beast, so watch your step and expect detours.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The clear skies and 17.7°C (that's a comfortable 64°F for those still on Fahrenheit) are tempting, a real reprieve from the unpredictable Texas winter. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's all sunshine and roses out there.

We've got "High Risk of Fire" warnings floating around, not directly in Plano, but close enough that we should be aware. There's an "UNNAMED" fire 69 miles south-southwest with winds pushing at 19 mph. The Texas A&M Forest Service had our state at a Level 3 Preparedness yesterday for wildfires, responding to 31 fires burning over 2,500 acres. While your run through Oak Point Park and Nature Preserve likely won't put you in the path of a blaze, elevated fire risk often means more particulate matter floating around, even if it's not a full-blown smoke-out. Couple that with the high pollen count and moderate ozone, and your respiratory system is already working overtime before you even lace up.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Fire Risk Is Real:** While no active wildfires are reported *in* Plano, the region has a high fire risk. Avoid any outdoor burning whatsoever. If you see smoke, report it immediately.

Then there's the ongoing saga of Plano's infrastructure. If you're planning a long ride or run, be ready for some detours. The Ed Sanders Trail is still closed due to DART construction, and that's been going on since 2023. Beyond the trails, expect lane closures and general road headaches across the city. Just last week, we saw updates on closures along Coit Road, 14th Street, Independence Parkway, and Spring Creek Parkway, with some projects stretching into 2027. Keep your head on a swivel if you're sharing the road.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Zone Ahead:** Significant road and trail construction is ongoing throughout Plano. Check the city's website for specific closures, especially if your route takes you near Plano Parkway or Coit Road. The Ed Sanders Trail remains closed.
</AlertBox>

So, if you absolutely *must* get out there, consider an indoor workout to spare your lungs the pollen and ozone cocktail. If the trails are calling, stick to shorter distances and pay attention to how you feel. And for the love of all that is holy, bring water, wear bright colors, and assume every driver hasn't seen a traffic cone, much less a runner, in weeks.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pollen & Ozone Plan:** If you have respiratory sensitivities, consider an indoor workout today. If you're heading outside, stick to shaded areas and consider wearing a mask if pollen usually gets the best of you.
