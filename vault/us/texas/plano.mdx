Look, if your lungs hate pollen and you're tired of dodging traffic cones, today isn't exactly a runner's paradise.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

### Why today is &lt;em&gt;not quite&lt;/em&gt; the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Your Lungs Are Under Attack:** It's a high pollen day, folks, which is just par for the course in North Texas this time of year. But on top of that, Plano's Air Quality Index is hitting a "Poor" rating for sensitive groups, with Nitrogen dioxide as the dominant pollutant. We're talking about PM2.5 and PM10 being elevated, too, meaning you're not just breathing in cedar and ragweed, you're getting a dose of urban grime and probably some regional wildfire haze. You might not see the smoke from the Panhandle fires directly, but those particulate matter levels are no joke for your respiratory system.
*   **Construction Zone Dodgeball:** Unless you enjoy an obstacle course that includes lane closures and heavy equipment, prepare for some route adjustments. Plano Parkway is a mess with ongoing lane closures expected through spring 2027. We've also got various street work messing with Custer Road, 14th Street, and Northcrest Drive, with concrete, sewer, and waterline projects making things interesting until March and April. Don't even get me started on the trails.
*   **Trail Turmoil:** Thinking of hitting the dirt? Not so fast. The City of Plano's official site shows active construction impacting trails. Shady Brook Trail, for instance, has a section closed due to unsafe conditions, and there's retaining wall renovation happening that won't wrap up until winter. Even the Cotton Belt Trail (Silver Line Rail Trail) is under construction for its hike & bike path, which just started in January and will be ongoing through summer 2027. While Oak Point Park & Nature Preserve has open natural surface trails, always check for specific paved trail closures there.

### AQI & Pollen Tag Team
Today's moderate AQI (86) isn't telling the whole story. AccuWeather is pegging Plano's air quality as "Poor" for sensitive groups due to elevated PM2.5, PM10, and especially Nitrogen dioxide. Combine that with high pollen levels, and you've got a recipe for irritated airways. If you're asthmatic or have other respiratory issues, seriously consider an indoor workout.

### Construction Chaos: Watch Your Step (and Your Lanes)
Road construction isn't just an inconvenience; it's a hazard. Expect detours and reduced lanes on major arteries like Plano Parkway and Custer Road. Even our beloved trails aren't safe from the Orange Cone Brigade. Always stay vigilant, assume drivers aren't paying attention, and if a trail looks sketchy or closed, respect the barricades. That "unsafe conditions" warning for Shady Brook Trail isn't just for show.

### Today's Allergy Breakdown for Plano:

| Pollen Type       | Level |
| :---------------- | :---- |
| Overall Tree      | High  |
| Overall Grass     | Low   |
| Overall Weed      | Low   |
| Dominant Allergen | Cedar |

### Your Best Bet
If you absolutely must get out there, stick to shorter routes on familiar, well-maintained paths where you know there isn't active construction. Head out earlier in the morning before traffic really picks up and kicks up more pollutants, and definitely before pollen counts peak. Shower immediately after to wash off allergens and pollutants. And for the love of your lungs, don't skimp on hydration.
