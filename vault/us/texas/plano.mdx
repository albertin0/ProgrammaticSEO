Alright Plano, let's talk about hitting the trails today. If you're planning an outdoor workout, you'd better bring your tissues and your patience, because between the allergies and the endless construction, it's a bit of a dumpster fire out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Your Lungs Will Hate You:** We're sitting at "Very High" pollen levels. Combine that with a "Moderate" AQI of 72, driven by nitrogen dioxide, and your respiratory system is in for a real treat. Don't even think about pushing intervals if you're prone to asthma or seasonal allergies.
*   **Watch Your Step (and Your Hearing):** Construction is a permanent fixture in this city, and it's actively messing with our best running spots. The NTMWD Custer Road Water Main Replacement Project is still chewing up lanes, creating noise and potential detours for anything more than a quick neighborhood jog. Same goes for sections of Legacy Trail, where they're replacing sewer lines.
*   **Gusty Winds Aren't Helping:** While not extreme, we've got south winds picking up to 15 mph with gusts up to 20 mph today. That's enough to kick up all that lovely pollen and dust, further irritating your airways and making you feel like you're running into a hairdryer.
</BulletList>

Today's temperature sits around a comfortable 15.3°C and it's clear out, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a perfect day. What you can't see is the air quality trying to wage war on your sinuses. AccuWeather actually lists our AQI as "Poor" and warns sensitive groups to reduce outdoor time due to high pollution levels.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Pollen Apocalypse is Real:** With "Very High" pollen, this isn't just a sniffle day. If you've got allergies, you're looking at watery eyes, sneezing fits, and a general feeling of malaise that will absolutely tank your workout. Consider an indoor alternative or at least load up on antihistamines.

**Construction Navigation:** If you *must* hit the trails, be smart about it. The Chisholm Trail Undercrossing at Spring Creek Parkway is still experiencing delays with its renovation, so check the City's trail closure map for detours before you head out. Legacy Trail also has intermittent closures due to the sewer main replacement. Don't assume your usual route is clear.

Here's the pollen breakdown for what's attacking us today:

| Pollen Type  | Level       |
| :----------- | :---------- |
| **Overall**  | Very High   |
| Tree Pollen  | Very High   |
| Grass Pollen | Low         |
| Weed Pollen  | Low         |

Seriously, if you're not absolutely married to getting miles in outside today, maybe hit the treadmill. Your lungs and joints (especially if you trip over some unexpected construction debris) will thank you.
