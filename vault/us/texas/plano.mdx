Forget about that picture-perfect run, Plano. Today, you're going to have to work for it, and then some.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky? It's just a front for "High" pollen counts that'll have your sinuses performing a symphony of sneezes.
*   Air Quality Index is clocking in at 82, with a nice dose of fine particulate matter floating around, meaning your lungs get an extra workout whether they want one or not.
*   The weather itself is glorious at 22.4°C, but don't let that fool you into thinking the trails are clear sailing. They are absolutely not.
</BulletList>

Look, I know you're itching to get out there, especially with this decent weather. But let's be brutally honest: your lungs are going to be fighting a two-front war today. First, you've got the high pollen assaulting your airways, which for anyone with allergies or asthma, means reaching for the tissues (and maybe an inhaler) before you even hit the pavement. Then, there's that AQI of 82. "Moderate" sounds fine until you're huffing and puffing, pulling in all that fine particulate matter. Think of it as tiny, invisible sandpaper for your lungs. Not exactly peak performance conditions.

Beyond the air you breathe, the ground beneath your feet is a minefield of current and upcoming construction projects. If your usual route takes you anywhere near the **Legacy Trail**, consider it a "choose your own adventure" with more detours than actual trail. The North Texas Municipal Water District is busy with a major sewer main replacement there, meaning intermittent closures through the summer. And don't even think about the Chisholm Trail undercrossing at Spring Creek Parkway, which is still on hold with material delays, or a section of the Shady Brook Trail that's currently closed due to unsafe conditions. It’s a mess out there.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Your Lungs Are Not Playthings:** With high pollen and moderate AQI (fine particulates), even a gentle breeze could kick up more irritants. If you're prone to seasonal allergies or respiratory issues, seriously reconsider anything more strenuous than a brisk walk, or just hit the treadmill.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Trail Takeover - Construction Ahead:** Major road and trail construction is ongoing across Plano. Roads like Parker, Legacy, and Plano Parkway have projects underway. More importantly for us runners, be prepared for significant disruptions on Legacy Trail, Chisholm Trail, and Shady Brook Trail. Sections are either intermittently closed or fully shut down, with some construction expected to last well into 2026 and 2027. Always check the City of Plano's updates *before* you head out, or you'll be adding unscheduled mileage to your cooldown trying to find a clear path.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Strategy for Survival:** If you must run outside today, plan an indoor workout as a backup. For outdoor activity, stick to known, shorter loops you can verify are clear, or embrace the treadmill. Consider an N95 mask if the particulate matter or pollen bothers you significantly, though that's not exactly comfortable for a hard run. And for the love of all that is holy, hydrate. You'll need it.
