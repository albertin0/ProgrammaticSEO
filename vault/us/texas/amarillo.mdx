Don't let that clear sky fool you entirely, Amarillo. Today's a mixed bag for hitting the pavement or the trails, so lace up with a dose of caution.

<BulletList>
*   The good news: temperatures are hovering around a pleasant 10.6°C (51°F) with clear skies, which sounds like prime running weather.
*   The bad news: we’re still dealing with moderate pollen, and the air quality, while not terrible at an AQI of 59, still has ozone as its dominant pollutant. Sensitive lungs, take note.
*   The ugly news: yesterday's intense winds and wildfire activity stirred up a *lot* of dust across the Panhandle, and while the gusts aren't 69 mph like they were at Rick Husband International Airport yesterday, that particulate matter doesn't just vanish.

### Pollen Breakdown

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Lungs (and Eyes)!**
Despite the overall "Moderate" AQI rating (which leans on ozone today), don't forget that yesterday saw significant wildfire activity and sustained strong winds that kicked up widespread blowing dust across the Texas Panhandle. Even if the immediate threat of smoke isn't pervasive, fine particulates can linger and easily be re-aerosolized, especially with any residual breeze. If you're hitting spots like the trails around Palo Duro Canyon, be aware that dry conditions and recent high winds mean dust could still be an issue for your respiratory system and contacts. Keep an eye on visibility, especially on exposed paths.

**Construction Chaos on Major Routes**
If your workout involves cycling or running along major thoroughfares, be prepared for headaches. The Georgia Street Reconstruction Project is in full swing, with a complete closure from SL 335 to Daytona Avenue. This isn't a quick fix; this section is expected to be shut down through May 31, 2026. That's a massive detour for anyone trying to navigate that area, whether you're on foot, bike, or in a car. Also, keep an eye out for continued work on the expansive SL 335 upgrade project, which aims to turn it into a four-lane freeway and includes new pedestrian and bike paths – but requires a lot of dirt and disruptions in the meantime. Plan your routes carefully, or find an alternative. Seriously, there's nothing zen about dodging heavy machinery.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate.**
Clear skies and moderate temperatures can still be deceptive. With the dry conditions that fueled yesterday's fire risks, your body will thank you for extra hydration. Don't leave home without your water bottle, even for shorter distances.
