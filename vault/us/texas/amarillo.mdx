Alright, Amarillo, if you're looking to hit the streets or trails today, it's a bit of a mixed bag, so don't just blindly walk out the door.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality for your lungs is officially "moderate" thanks to ozone, and you've got moderate pollen to contend with on top of that. Don't go setting any personal bests if you're sensitive.
*   We're still dealing with some elevated wildfire risk in the Panhandle, which means keeping an eye on the wind is smart, even if the immediate smoke isn't choking you out.
*   On the bright side, the temperature is absolutely fantastic for February, sitting at a comfortable 15°C (59°F) and clear skies.
</BulletList>

### Lungs: Moderate Annoyance
Look, nobody loves "moderate" air quality, especially when ozone is the dominant pollutant. The city's own forecast might say "Good" for ozone today, but your provided data is showing 65 AQI with ozone, so trust what you've got in front of you. Combine that with a solid "moderate" pollen count, and you've got a recipe for some irritated airways, particularly if you already have respiratory issues. Don't push it too hard out there today; it's not the day for max effort sprints down Coulter.

Speaking of air, the Texas Panhandle is still under increased wildfire risk due to dry conditions and high winds. While no active Red Flag Warning is specifically issued for Amarillo today, these regional conditions mean fire weather is still a concern through the weekend. If you smell smoke or see anything suspicious, adjust your route immediately.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone & Pollen Combo:** With moderate AQI from ozone and moderate pollen, sensitive individuals might experience respiratory discomfort. Consider keeping your outdoor workouts to a moderate intensity.

### Joints: Mostly Happy, But Watch Your Step
Your joints are getting a nice break today with that sweet 15°C (59°F) weather. No ice, no extreme heat, just pleasant conditions. However, don't let that lull you into a false sense of security.

If you're a golfer, tough luck. The **Comanche Trail Golf Complex** is completely closed today for electrical upgrades by Xcel Energy. So much for getting your 18 holes in. You'll have to head over to Ross Rogers if you're desperate for a round.

Also, the equestrian trails over at **Palo Duro Canyon State Park** have been closed for maintenance since January 9th. So if your workout involves hoofs, you're out of luck there too.

Around town, there's ongoing construction. Remember that Georgia Street reconstruction is still messing with traffic patterns until May, and there are other projects, like the SL 335 expansion, which will be ongoing until late 2026. Keep an eye out for unexpected detours, uneven surfaces, and increased vehicle traffic if you're running or cycling on city streets.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Stay Aware of Construction:** Always be vigilant for construction zones and temporary detours, especially on main thoroughfares like Georgia Street and around the SL 335 corridor. These can appear quickly and change your route.
