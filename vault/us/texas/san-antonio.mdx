Alright, San Antonio, today's one of those days where you *can* get outside, but you better be paying attention, or you'll end up detouring into a construction zone or inhaling someone else's bad choices.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Fire Hazard is REAL (and close):** There's a Red Flag Warning for our friends in the Hill Country to the north and west from 11 AM to 7 PM, thanks to unseasonably warm temps, low humidity, and winds gusting up to 25 mph. Bexar County itself is under a high fire danger. This isn't just a "Hill Country problem"—if something sparks up, that wind is pushing it our way, and the air quality could go south fast.
*   **Construction Creep is Still Your Biggest Trail Hazard:** Expect your favorite routes to be interrupted. The Leon Creek Greenway under the 1604 overpass is still messed up from TxDOT work, and various segments of the Salado Creek Greenway, like the section near Tobin Park Trailhead, are seeing intermittent closures. Even some sections of San Pedro Avenue are undergoing major VIA Rapid Green Line construction with lane and sidewalk closures. Don't be that person surprised by a "Trail Closed" sign; check before you roll out.
*   **Seasonal Allergies, Meet Moderate AQI:** Pollen is moderate, which is par for the course right now. What's less fun is an AQI of 60, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) as the dominant pollutant. Mix that with moderate winds and potential wildfire smoke from our neighbors, and your lungs might feel it, especially if you're sensitive.

## Pollen & Air Quality Breakdown

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant       |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------------- |
| Moderate     | 60  | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10&mu;m) |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads up, Trail Runners and Cyclists!** Those brisk northerly winds (10-15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph) are fueling a high fire danger in Bexar County and a Red Flag Warning just outside city limits. A small spark from a dropped cigarette, a poorly extinguished campfire, or even a hot car catalytic converter could turn into a big problem quickly. Be hyper-aware, especially if you're out on the unpaved sections of our greenways.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Leon Creek Greenway: Expect Interruptions!** Parts of the Leon Creek Greenway, especially under the Loop 1604 overpass near the Valero Trailhead, have been impacted by TxDOT construction and were closed through mid-February. While some dates might be "through" mid-February, these projects notoriously run over, so proceed with caution and be ready for detours or full turnarounds. Check the City of San Antonio Parks and Rec website for the absolute latest specific closures before you plan a long run there.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration and Sun Protection:** It's February, but the forecast high is flirting with the 90s (33C). "Unusually hot" is the term they're throwing around. Even if it doesn't quite hit that, 70F (20.9C) and sunny means you'll still be sweating. Bring more water than you think you need, especially if you're susceptible to the heat.
</AlertBox>

Don't let the beautiful clear skies fool you into thinking it's an easy day out there. Stay safe, stay smart, and for the love of all that is holy, extinguish your damn campfires.
