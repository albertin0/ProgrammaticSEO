Today? Yeah, you can get out there, but don't assume your usual route is clear sailing.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
  - Air quality is just okay with some particulate matter, so don't go for a PR if your lungs are finicky.
  - Construction isn't just a suggestion, folks; actual trails and park access points are SHUT DOWN. Plan ahead or be ready to reroute.
  - Temps are sweet, and pollen is practically non-existent, making for a comfortable run if you dodge the roadblocks.
</BulletList>

Look, the weather gods finally decided to play nice today in San Antonio. We're looking at a glorious 18.1°C (that's around 64.6°F for you non-metric folks) and clear skies. Perfect running weather, right? Almost. Don't let that fool you into thinking it's a completely hazard-free zone. Your lungs might be catching a break from the usual cedar assault, with pollen levels sitting pretty at "Low." But the Air Quality Index is creeping into the "Moderate" zone at 59, with inhalable particulate matter being the dominant pollutant. Combine that with the National Weather Service forecasting potential patchy morning fog around sunrise, and if you're sensitive, you might feel it.

  ### Construction Chaos is REAL
  Seriously, if your workout route involves any major thoroughfare or popular greenway, you need to check local updates. TxDOT is still tearing up our highways with ongoing work on **Loop 1604, I-35, and US 90**, which means unexpected lane closures and detours are the norm, not the exception. But it's not just the roads. The city is busy improving parks and trails too, which is great long-term, but a pain right now.
</AlertBox>

Specifically, the **Lees Creek Park** walking trail is closed for improvements until the end of March. If you're a regular on the **Culebra Creek Greenway**, a section within Culebra Creek Park is undergoing reconstruction for the next three months. And don't even think about a full, uninterrupted trek along parts of the **San Pedro Creek Culture Park**'s east bank trail, as sections are temporarily closed for ongoing work. Even the **Mission Reach**, a gem for many, has its Acequia Park Trailhead temporarily closed due to "stem density work" south of Theo Avenue to Mission Road. Don't be that person surprised by a "Trail Closed" sign after a mile-long sprint.

  ### Heads Up, Urban Warriors
  If you're running or cycling on city streets, remember the City of San Antonio Transportation Department launched its "High-Injury Network Dashboard" recently. It pinpoints where the most severe crashes happen. Keep your head on a swivel, assume drivers don't see you, and make eye contact. Traffic impacts from the VIA Rapid Green Line construction on San Pedro Avenue, with intermittent lane and sidewalk closures, will also affect urban routes.

So, enjoy that crisp, relatively clean air and low pollen count, but do your homework before you head out. Or just resign yourself to some creative detouring. It's San Antonio, after all; we're built on layers of history and, apparently, endless construction projects.
