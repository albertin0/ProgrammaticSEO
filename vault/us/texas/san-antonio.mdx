Today in San Antonio? Unless you're trying to set a new record for "sweatiest run" or "least breathable air," you might want to reconsider that outdoor workout.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Actual Record-Breaking Heat:** We're talking February highs pushing into the low to mid-90s Fahrenheit, possibly even challenging a 72-year-old record of 91 degrees. This isn't your grandma's mild winter day; this is "feel like April or May" heat, and it's dangerous for anything more strenuous than walking to your AC unit.
*   **Fire Danger is Real:** A Red Flag Warning is active for parts of the Hill Country, and Bexar County itself is under high fire danger. Gusty winds up to 25 mph combined with low humidity are a recipe for disaster. Think twice before hitting trails like those near Government Canyon State Natural Area, where dry brush is plentiful.
*   **Pollen and Trail Headaches:** While the AQI is holding steady in the good range, pollen is moderate, and if you planned on a scenic long run, parts of the Mission Reach are still dealing with maintenance closures.

## The Rundown: Don't Be a Heat Casualty

Seriously, folks, the mercury is climbing today. Forecasters are calling for temperatures in San Antonio to hit the low 90s, with some areas south and west potentially flirting with triple digits. This is not normal for late February, and it carries a significant risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Your lungs, while currently enjoying good air quality (AQI 45), are still contending with moderate pollen and the general stress of breathing hot air during exertion. Plus, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is forecasting Ozone/PM2.5 for San Antonio, meaning air quality could degrade later in the day due to ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter, some of which might be lingering smoke from Mexico.

**Extreme Heat Warning!** With temperatures potentially hitting 90-98°F (32-37°C), outdoor exercise, especially in the afternoon, is incredibly risky. Hydrate constantly, wear light clothing, and consider moving your workout indoors to avoid heat-related illnesses. Listen to your body – dizziness, nausea, or excessive sweating are not signs of a "good workout." They're signs you're cooking yourself.
</AlertBox>

If you insist on getting out there, be smart. Head out at dawn, not in the middle of the afternoon. Carry more water than you think you need. Consider sticking to routes with some shade, like parts of the Salado Creek Greenway, though even then, shade won't completely negate the heat.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**High Fire Danger in Bexar County!** While the Red Flag Warning is primarily for the Hill Country, Bexar County is still facing a high fire danger. If you're running on any natural surface trails, especially those bordering undeveloped areas, be extra vigilant. A stray spark from anything – even a hot car exhaust if you're parking near dry grass – could ignite a fast-spreading wildfire, especially with those 25 mph wind gusts.

And speaking of trails, if your usual route includes the Mission Reach, specifically the Acequia Park Trailhead area, be aware it's temporarily closed. Crews are doing "stem density work" south of Theo Avenue and Probandt Street to Mission Road. This isn't a minor detour; it's an ongoing project expected to last until Spring 2026, so plan your route accordingly or find an alternative.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Mission Reach Partial Closure:** The Acequia Park Trailhead along the Mission Reach of the San Antonio River is temporarily closed for vegetation maintenance until Spring 2026. This affects the section from south of Theo Avenue and Probandt Street to Mission Road. Look for signage and plan alternative routes.
