If you're thinking about hitting the trails today in San Antonio, you might want to reconsider, or at the very least, drastically adjust your plans.

<BulletList>
*   It's hotter than Hades out there, folks. We're looking at potential record-breaking temperatures, pushing into the low to mid-90s, possibly even touching 98 degrees by late afternoon. That's *April* weather in *February*, and it's dangerous.
*   The extreme heat coupled with strong gusts up to 25 mph and low humidity means an elevated wildfire risk. There's a Red Flag Warning for much of the Hill Country until 7 p.m., so staying out of wildland-urban interface areas is just plain smart.
*   Moderate pollen levels from our early spring preview will add insult to injury if you're battling allergies on top of heat exhaustion.

## Today's Rundown: The Heat is ON, Literally

Seriously, San Antonio, this isn't normal. Forecasters are saying we could tie or break a 72-year-old record high of 91 degrees today, with some spots even eyeing 100°F. This kind of heat in February is an express ticket to heatstroke if you're not careful. Your usual mid-day run down the Mission Reach? Yeah, maybe not today, unless you fancy ending up in an ambulance instead of at the finish line.

The dry, gusty winds aren't just making it feel like a hair dryer; they're fanning the flames of wildfire risk. A Red Flag Warning means conditions are ripe for blazes to spread fast, especially west of the city. Do yourself and the first responders a favor and don't be that person who accidentally starts something with a carelessly tossed cigarette butt or hot car parked on dry grass.

### Local Trail Headaches & Hazards

Beyond the obvious "don't die of heatstroke" warning, we've got a few local annoyances to be aware of:

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Heat Warning:** Temperatures are forecast to be well into the 90s, possibly nearing 100°F in some areas. This is dangerously hot. Hydrate aggressively, schedule outdoor activity for very early morning or late evening, and listen to your body. Heat exhaustion and heatstroke are serious.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**High Wildfire Danger:** A Red Flag Warning is in effect for much of the Hill Country from 11 AM to 7 PM due to high winds (up to 25 mph) and low humidity. Avoid anything that could spark a fire, especially if you're near dry brush or natural areas.
</AlertBox>

Over on the **Mission Reach**, specifically the Acequia Park Trailhead, they're doing "Stem Density work" from Monday through Friday afternoons, which means temporary closures. Don't plan on a smooth, uninterrupted run there during peak work hours. Also, a heads-up for anyone using the northern part of the **Brackenridge Park Trail** near Josephine Street inlet and Highway 281: the lighting is out due to electrical issues, with repairs expected by tomorrow. If you're out there in the dark, proceed with extreme caution.

And, as always, our city loves a good construction project. You'll find intermittent closures on parts of the Leon Creek Greenway (under the 1604 overpass north of Valero Trailhead) and the Salado Creek Greenway near Tobin Park Trailhead. The trail in Culebra Creek Park that links to the Culebra Creek Greenway is also shut down for about three months for reconstruction. Check the city's parks website before you head out, unless you enjoy running into "trail closed" signs.

<AlertBox type="info">
If you're still determined to get outside despite the glaring sun and fire warnings, do it smart. Early morning is your *only* safe bet. Wear light, loose clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and carry more water than you think you need. Or, you know, just use the AC and hit the treadmill. Your lungs and joints will thank you.
