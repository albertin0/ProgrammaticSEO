Look, if you're planning a PR attempt today, maybe just hit the treadmill, because San Antonio is giving us a real mixed bag of "meh, maybe not."

<BulletList>
*   **It's already a sauna out there.** We're hitting 30°C (that's 86°F for you old-schoolers), and it's only going to get hotter this week with temps possibly creeping into the 90s. This isn't exactly prime running weather, folks, unless you enjoy feeling like a slow-cooked brisket.
*   **The air isn't exactly pristine.** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a "moderate" 56, with inhalable particulate matter being the main culprit. Given the near-critical fire conditions today and a wildfire burning (albeit 80% contained) in Gillespie County, that airborne crud isn't going to do your lungs any favors, even if we're not seeing thick smoke right downtown.
*   **Your favorite trails are probably messed up.** Good luck finding an uninterrupted run on the greenways. We've got major closures on the **Culebra Creek Greenway** for reconstruction, sections of the **Leon Creek Greenway** still impacted by TxDOT work under the 1604 overpass, and the **Acequia Park Trailhead** on the Mission Reach is shut down for "stem density" work through spring. Oh, and if you like running after dark in **Brackenridge Park**, the lighting is out on the north side of the trail near Josephine Street. Repairs are *supposed* to happen by tomorrow, but don't hold your breath.

## The Heat is On (Literally)

We're in late February, and it feels like summer decided to crash the party early. With temperatures pushing into the upper 80s today and forecasts hinting at 90s tomorrow, heatstroke is a real concern, not some abstract warning. Hydration isn't just a suggestion; it's survival. And if you’re thinking about pushing a long run, remember that your body works harder in this kind of heat. Your heart rate will be elevated, and your ability to cool yourself diminishes significantly. This isn't the weather to test your limits.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heat Advisory (My Version):** Seriously, stick to early mornings or late evenings if you *must* run outside. Wear light-colored, moisture-wicking clothes. Carry more water than you think you need, and for the love of all that is holy, don't ignore the signs of heat exhaustion. Dizziness, nausea, extreme sweating—that's your body telling you to quit. Listen to it.

## Air Quality & Fire Risk

While the AQI of 56 is "Moderate," it's due to particulate matter. Coupled with the "near-critical fire conditions" today across South Central Texas and a Red Flag Warning kicking in tomorrow for our western neighbors, the air isn't exactly crisp. The Nebo Mountain Fire in Gillespie County, while mostly contained, means there’s active burning in the region, which absolutely impacts air quality even if San Antonio isn't directly in a smoke plume. If you've got any kind of respiratory issues, this is a day to seriously consider an indoor workout.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Lungs First:** Even if you don't feel smoke, the particulate matter can irritate your lungs and throat. If you're asthmatic or have other respiratory conditions, stay inside. Even for healthy runners, this isn't optimal breathing air for high-intensity efforts.

## Trail Troubles: A City of Construction

Our beloved greenways are a patchwork of closures right now. The continuous closures for reconstruction on sections like the **Culebra Creek Greenway** or the temporary (but ongoing) electrical issues on the **Brackenridge Park Trail** can throw a wrench in your plans and force you onto less safe routes. Don't assume your usual loop is open. Check the City of San Antonio Parks and Recreation website *before* you head out. Nothing is more frustrating than lacing up only to hit a "TRAIL CLOSED" sign a mile in. Also, a heads-up for those familiar with the Mission Reach: the **Acequia Park Trailhead** is closed for maintenance until spring. Find an alternate route or just accept your fate and hit the pavement.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Always Check Before You Trek:** Construction and maintenance are ongoing all over the city. A quick check of the San Antonio Parks and Recreation website for current trail closures will save you a lot of wasted time and frustration. Seriously, just do it.
