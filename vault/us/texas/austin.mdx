Alright, Austin, let's talk about hitting the trails today.

Today is one of those days that *looks* perfect for a workout but is secretly trying to mess with your lungs and your navigation skills.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Gorgeous, clear skies and a balmy 26.9°C (that's 80°F for you Celsius-averse folks) make it *feel* like a prime day to sweat. Hydrate, people.
*   Don't let that "good" AQI number completely fool you. With a "Very High" pollen count and inhalable particulate matter floating around, your respiratory system is in for a fight.
*   Major construction around Lady Bird Lake and other key routes means your usual run might involve more detours and less flow than a city council meeting.
</BulletList>

## Pollen & Air Quality: A Sneaky Combo

You see that clear sky and think "perfect." I see that "Very High" pollen count and the mention of "Inhalable particulate matter" at an otherwise "good" AQI of 50, and I hear your lungs wheezing later. While 50 is generally fine, when cedar and oak are practically assaulting the air, those fine particulates just hitch a ride right into your airways. If you've got even a hint of allergies or asthma, today's outdoor run is a guaranteed snot-and-cough fest. Be smart, carry your inhaler, and maybe consider an indoor spin class if you're prone to seasonal suffering.

## Construction Chaos: Lady Bird Lake and Beyond

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Major I-35 Construction Impacting Lady Bird Lake Trails!**

The I-35 Capital Express Central Project is a beast, and it's making a mess of your favorite running spots. As of the week of February 9th, the east-side pedestrian crossing over I-35 near Lady Bird Lake is **CLOSED for roughly a year** to build the new bridge. This means you CANNOT cross between the north and south shores on the east side of I-35. Don't even try it unless you like playing Frogger with construction vehicles.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, if your route involves crossing I-35 on the east side of the lake, you need a new plan. The good news? The new Wishbone Pedestrian Bridge at Pleasant Valley opened on February 7th, so that's your new best friend if you're trying to get across the lake further east. Otherwise, head west and cross at South Congress if you must.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Boardwalk Access and Lou Neff Road Detours:**

The pedestrian ramp to the Boardwalk along northbound I-35 frontage road at Riverside Drive is closed through 2029. While the Boardwalk itself and the staircase *should* be open, expect intermittent closures. Also, a short-term detour is in effect near Lou Neff Road, routing trail users onto the road. Expect delays and be extra cautious sharing the road with vehicles.
</AlertBox>

And let's not forget the Shoal Creek Trail. That landslide area between 26th-27th Street is *still* closed, with detours on the N Lamar Blvd sidewalk. Construction is ongoing between 29th-31st Street as well, adding more potential closures and congestion.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Travis County Burn Ban:**

There's an active Burn Ban for Travis County as of February 10th. This mostly affects campfires and outdoor burning, but it's a good reminder that conditions are dry, even with recent cooler weather. Be mindful if you're off the paved trails.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're heading out today, choose your path wisely. Hydrate aggressively, consider your respiratory health, and be prepared for some unexpected detours and urban scrambling. Or, you know, just hit the gym. Your call.
