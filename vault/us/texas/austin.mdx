Today? Forget about hitting that perfect stride without some serious caveats.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
*   **Your lungs are going to hate you.** "Very High" tree pollen combined with an AQI of 50 means a double whammy for your respiratory system. You'll be breathing in more than just fresh air, thanks to Elm, Cedar/Juniper, and Ash making their presence known.
*   **The trails are a minefield of detours.** TxDOT's never-ending I-35 Capital Express Central Project continues to wreak havoc on the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail around Lady Bird Lake. If you're planning on crossing Lady Bird Lake near I-35, the east-side pedestrian crossing is closed for roughly a year. You'll need to reroute over the South Congress Bridge or hit the new Wishbone Pedestrian Bridge at Pleasant Valley. Plus, that convenient parking lot under I-35? Gone until 2033.
*   **It's hot, windy, and crispy.** Temps are pushing into the upper 80s°F (around 31°C) with winds gusting up to 30 mph. This isn't just uncomfortable; it's dangerous, especially with a Red Flag Warning for critical fire conditions in the nearby Hill Country.

### Trail Closures & Detours Are Widespread
Seriously, folks, parts of the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail are a mess. The TxDOT I-35 Capital Express Central Project has shut down the east-side I-35 pedestrian crossing near Lady Bird Lake, and it's not coming back for about a year. Expect reroutes, blocked access, and a general headache if your route involves that section. On top of that, there's a short-term detour near Lou Neff Road and ongoing streambank repair on Barton Creek that'll push you onto Toomey Road. Double-check your route before you head out, especially if you're on two wheels.

### Red Flag Warning for Fire Danger
The Hill Country is under a Red Flag Warning from 11 AM to 7 PM today due to breezy winds, low humidity, and high temperatures. While Austin isn't directly *in* the warning area, the dry, windy conditions mean any spark could quickly get out of hand. Think twice about anything that could cause a fire, and if you see smoke, report it immediately.

### Protect Your Lungs
With "Very High" pollen and an AQI that's "Poor" for sensitive groups, consider taking your workout indoors. If you must be outside, go early in the morning before pollen counts peak and traffic pollution has a chance to build up. Wear a mask if you're particularly susceptible to allergens or airborne particulates. And for the love of all that is holy, hydrate. You're losing a lot more moisture than you realize in this dry, windy heat.
