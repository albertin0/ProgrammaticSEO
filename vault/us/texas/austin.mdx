Look, if you're planning on crushing any PRs outside today, you might want to rethink your definition of "crushing." More like "crushing your lungs and joints."

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

### Why today is absolutely *not* the day:

<BulletList>
*   Your allergies just called, and they're bringing all their friends. We're talking *Very High* pollen levels, folks. Enjoy that watery-eyed, snot-nosed dash.
*   It's February 25th, and it's nearly 29 freaking degrees Celsius (that's pushing 84°F for the Fahrenheit folks). This isn't a spring jog; it's a mid-summer suffer-fest waiting to happen.
*   Air quality is moderate at an AQI of 57, but don't let that fool you into a false sense of security. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, with residual smoke from scattered burning activities across the state likely kicking up those PM2.5 levels. Your lungs are doing double duty fighting pollen and micro-soot.
</BulletList>

You wanted to hit the trails around **Lady Bird Lake**? Good luck, champ. The I-35 Capital Express Central Project has turned the area into a perpetual construction zone. The I-35 pedestrian bridge has been closed since early February and isn't reopening anytime soon, forcing you way out of your preferred route to cross between the north and south shores. If you *do* manage to navigate the detour, watch out for reroutes on the Butler Hike and Bike Trail itself, which are expected to continue through 2033. Planning a simple loop these days feels like solving a riddle wrapped in an enigma, covered in orange cones.

| Tree Pollen        | Very High      | Cedar (Ashe Juniper) is likely still in full swing, even if it's winding down, and other trees are waking up with this heat. Expect misery.                                                                      |
| Air Quality (AQI)  | 57 (Moderate)  | Dominant pollutant is Inhalable Particulate Matter (&lt;10µm). Light density residual smoke aerosols from regional burning activities are adding to the particulate load. Travis County recently failed new EPA standards for fine particulate matter, so "moderate" might be a bit of a sugarcoat. |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**WILDFIRE SMOKE & FIRE DANGER:** While there aren't *major* fires directly in Austin reported today, the broader Texas region is under "elevated-to-critical fire weather conditions" due to dry air, strong winds, and high temperatures. Light smoke from scattered burning activities is contributing to the particulate matter in our air. If you're west of I-35, fire weather conditions are elevated, and Travis County even has a burn ban in place. Don't be surprised if your afternoon run tastes a little like campfire.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**EXTREME HEAT FOR FEBRUARY:** Seriously, 29°C in late February is just wrong. This isn't "nice and warm," it's "dehydration and heat exhaustion risk" weather, especially if you're not acclimatized. Stay hydrated, and if you must run, keep it short and in the shade, preferably before 8 AM.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**TRAIL CONSTRUCTION & CLOSURES:** The I-35 Capital Express project has shut down key pedestrian crossings and rerouted parts of the Butler Hike and Bike Trail near Lady Bird Lake. Expect delays, confusing signage, and an increased chance of running on uneven surfaces or closer to traffic. Barton Springs Pool is also closed for maintenance until mid-March. This isn't the day for a spontaneous long run around the lake. Check the city's parks and recreation website before you head out, or just stick to your neighborhood streets.
</AlertBox>

Look, I get it. We're runners. We like to be outside. But sometimes, the city and the universe conspire against us. Today's a prime example. Save your lungs and your sanity. Hit the treadmill, hit a spin class, or just hit up a local coffee shop (indoors, please) instead.
