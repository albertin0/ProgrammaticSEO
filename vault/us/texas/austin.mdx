Look, the weather's clear and the temperature is alright, but your lungs are going to hate you today, so maybe keep it indoors if you're prone to seasonal misery.

<BulletList>
*   **Pollen Apocalypse:** We're talking "Very High" pollen levels out there, folks. If you don't already feel it, you will. Your nose will run more than the Barton Creek Greenbelt after a downpour.
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** An AQI of 67 means moderate air quality, and the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter. So, you'll be breathing in tree dust *and* other crud. Double whammy for your respiratory system.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Major roadwork is still eating up parts of our city, especially around I-35 and some of our prime running spots. Expect detours and less-than-ideal conditions.
</BulletList>

Today's a classic Austin late-February day where it *looks* nice, but the air wants to fight you. That 17.3°C (63°F) and clear sky is a cruel mistress, luring you outside just to assault your airways. The "Very High" pollen count, likely from our overzealous cedar and oak trees, combined with a moderate AQI (thanks, fine particulate matter), makes for a less-than-ideal breathing experience. If you’re not an allergy sufferer, you might just feel a bit more winded than usual. If you *are* an allergy sufferer, well, I hope your Zyrtec is prescription strength.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Respiratory Ruckus:** Between the "Very High" pollen and moderate AQI with particulate matter, your lungs are in for a workout whether you want them to be or not. Consider an N95 mask if you absolutely must run outside, or opt for indoor cardio today.
</AlertBox>

On the bright side, the temperature is perfect, and we don't have any immediate threats like wildfires or floods. However, if you're planning on hitting the **Ann and Roy Butler Hike and Bike Trail** along Lady Bird Lake, especially near I-35, prepare for a maze. The I-35 Capital Express Central Project has significant detours in effect. The pedestrian ramp to the Boardwalk at Riverside Drive is closed until 2029. Also, the east-side I-35 pedestrian crossing is completely shut down for about a year as they build the new Lady Bird Lake Bridge. While the new Wishbone Pedestrian Bridge at Pleasant Valley opened recently as an alternative, crossing the lake on the east side of I-35 is a no-go. You'll find significant reroutes on the north shore of the trail all the way through 2033.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**I-35 Trail Closures:** Avoid attempting to cross Lady Bird Lake on the east side of I-35 via pedestrian pathways. Major bridge construction has closed this route for roughly a year, with overall project detours on the Hike and Bike Trail lasting through 2033. Use the South Congress bridge or the new Wishbone Pedestrian Bridge at Pleasant Valley if you need to cross.
</AlertBox>

Even if you're not near the lake, South Lamar Boulevard is still a construction zone, with the Mary Street Roundabout wrapping up and storm drain improvements ongoing through 2027. Expect lane closures and general road headaches for all users.

So, if you brave the outdoors, be prepared for some serious congestion in your sinuses and on the roads/trails.

**Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate:** With the high pollen count, staying well-hydrated can help thin mucus and potentially alleviate some allergy symptoms. Carry more water than you think you need.
