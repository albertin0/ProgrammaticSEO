Alright, Corpus Christi, let's talk. Today's not terrible, but you'll have to earn that sweat with a bit of navigation and a dose of caution.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The temperature is solid for a run, but if you're hitting the pavement early, that famous Coastal Bend fog is rolling in. Expect limited visibility near the water and inland until around 9 AM. Don't be that person who thinks their neon gear is a superpower against a wall of mist.
*   Pollen is playing nice, which is a win for all you sniffly sufferers.
*   Air Quality is nudging into "moderate" territory, likely thanks to the lingering regional wildfire activity. While not directly *in* our backyard, the Texas Panhandle is still dealing with fires and the smoke drifts. Your lungs won't be screaming, but they might grumble a bit.

## The Daily Grind: Fog, Fine Particles, and Forever Construction

Look, the weather gods are mostly on our side today. We're sitting pretty at about 19.5°C with clear skies once that morning gloom burns off. No blistering heat, no sudden downpours, and the wind, for once, isn't trying to rip your hat off. Enjoy it while it lasts, because we know how fast things change around here.

The biggest pain in your posterior, as always, is going to be the city's seemingly endless quest to repave, rebuild, and generally reconfigure every single road we rely on. We've got major projects underway that are still causing headaches for drivers and runners alike. The City has a fresh list of closures for February 28th, and it's extensive.

If you're planning a scenic jaunt along the Oso Creek Greenbelt, be aware that Yorktown Boulevard between Rodd Field Road and the Oso Creek Mud Bridge still has westbound lanes closed, funneling traffic into a two-way nightmare on the eastbound side. So, while the greenbelt itself might be clear, getting *to* it might be a test of your patience and pedestrian agility. Same goes for the ongoing work on Bonner Drive, Aaron Drive, and Castenon Street – expect detours and keep your head on a swivel. This isn't just about cars; it's about sidewalk closures, uneven surfaces, and distracted drivers trying to figure out which temporary lane to take.

### Watch Your Step, Literally: Construction Zones
Corpus Christi remains a perpetual construction zone. Pay attention to all detour signs and temporary walkways, especially around major projects like Yorktown Boulevard, Bonner Drive, and Aaron Drive. Many of these projects are still on track for completion later this spring, so don't expect miracles overnight. Your usual route might be a minefield of cones and equipment.

### Morning Fog: Be Seen or Stay Home
If you're an early bird, that dense fog rolling in from the bay is no joke. Seriously, dig out your brightest gear and consider a headlamp, even if the sun *should* be up. It’s better to look like a glow stick than become part of a fender bender.

### Pollen Breakdown (Don't @ Me, Allergens)

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for your sinuses, folks. The pollen count is low today, so breathe easy on that front.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Regional Smoke & Burn Bans
While our local AQI isn't in the red zone, the persistent wildfire danger across the state, including an ongoing burn ban in Nueces County, means conditions are ripe for smoke. If you start smelling smoke or notice unusual haze, especially if you have respiratory issues, maybe opt for an indoor workout. That "fine particulate matter" in our AQI isn't coming from nowhere.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today's workout is a go, but plan your route, stay vigilant, and accept that getting around might require a little extra effort.
