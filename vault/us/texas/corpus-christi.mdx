Listen, Corpus Christi, today ain't exactly a runner's paradise, but it's not a complete wash either.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is sitting at a "moderate" 57, with fine particulate matter messing with your lungs. Don't be a hero; your airways deserve better.
*   While the thermometer might say a balmy 27.2°C (81°F) right now, local forecasts are yelling about temperatures soaring into the 90s and even hitting 100°F today. That's "oven" territory, not "optimal training."
*   Southerly winds are whipping through at around 20 knots, gusting up to 30 knots. You'll be fighting a headwind one minute and pushed sideways the next, making any sustained effort a real grind.
*   Construction is still a nightmare, especially around Oso Parkway where they've got a full street closure for drainage work. Your "scenic route" might just be a detour into traffic.

### Your Lungs & Joints Today

Alright, let's talk turkey. The low pollen count is about the only good news for your respiratory system right now. Everything else is leaning into the "maybe stay inside, champ" zone. That AQI of 57 with fine particulate matter? That's not terrible, but it's enough to irritate if you're pushing it, especially with those winds kicking everything up.

And the heat. Oh, the heat. My weather app says 27.2°C, but every local news outlet is screaming about us hitting the 90s and possibly 100°F. That's not just "warm," that's "actively dangerous" for a long run, even in February. We've got above-normal temperatures expected all weekend, so this isn't a fluke. Hydration is non-negotiable, and maybe push that long run to tomorrow morning at the crack of dawn, before the city turns into a convection oven.

Then there's the wind. A small craft advisory is in effect, which means it's breezy enough to make your run feel like you're fighting an invisible wall, or getting shoved from behind when you least expect it.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**DANGER: Extreme Heat & High Winds.** The combination of forecasted 90-100°F temperatures and sustained 20-30 knot winds creates a significant risk for heat exhaustion and dehydration. Plan any outdoor activity for early morning or late evening, keep it short, and carry plenty of water.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**WARNING: Watch for Construction Zones.** Don't assume your usual route is clear. There's a full street closure on Oso Parkway for drainage infrastructure work, and many other roads like Everhart Road are seeing ongoing construction and lane closures. Be ready for unexpected detours, distracted drivers, and uneven surfaces.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Tip: Moderate Your Activity.** With the moderate AQI and high winds stirring things up, take it easy. If your chest feels tight or you're coughing more than usual, head inside. This isn't the day to try for a PR.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, folks. Corpus Christi can be a beautiful place to run, but today requires some serious common sense. Your PR can wait; your health can't.
