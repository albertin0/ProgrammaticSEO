Look, if you're planning an afternoon run in Corpus Christi today, you're either a glutton for punishment or you haven't checked the forecast.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Don't breathe that in, for real:** The AQI might look "moderate" on paper at 59, but that's a lie. We're getting a generous dose of "elevated Particle Matter" from smoke wafting up from Mexico and Central America. They're even calling it "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups," which, let's be honest, means most of us after a solid effort. Your lungs don't need that.
*   **It's gonna be a scorcher:** That lovely 20.4°C (68.7°F) morning? Kiss it goodbye. The mercury is set to soar, possibly hitting a brutal 90°F (32°C) or even 96°F (35.6°C) later today. It's February, for crying out loud! This isn't normal, and your body's going to hate that sudden spike, especially when combined with the particulate matter. Hydrate like your life depends on it, because it kind of does.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Just when you thought you had your route dialed in, remember that Corpus Christi is in a perpetual state of "improvement." Expect detours and uneven surfaces, particularly around ongoing projects like those impacting Yorktown Boulevard near Rodd Field Road. Keep your head on a swivel.

Honestly, the air quality alone is enough to make me suggest the treadmill, and I *hate* the treadmill. But when you add in the forecasted heat spike, it's just asking for trouble. If you absolutely *must* get outside, make it an early morning affair before the heat really cranks up and the air gets even thicker.

Pollen is thankfully low today, so at least your sinuses won't be staging a full-blown rebellion on top of everything else.

### Today's Allergy & Air Quality Breakdown

| Pollutant Category        | Level       | AQI/Notes                                                                     |
| :------------------------ | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overall AQI**           | Moderate    | 59 (but elevated particulate matter, "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups") |
| **Dominant Pollutant**    | PM10        | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm)                              |
| **Pollen Level**          | Low         |                                                                               |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**HEAT ALERT:** Temperatures will rapidly climb into the low to mid-90s this afternoon. This is dangerously hot for sustained outdoor activity, especially with the added strain on your respiratory system from the elevated particulate matter in the air. Consider moving your workout indoors during peak heat.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**SMOKE ADVISORY:** That "moderate" AQI is misleading. We have elevated levels of inhalable particulate matter from distant smoke. If you have respiratory issues like asthma or COPD, or are otherwise sensitive, seriously reconsider outdoor exercise today. Shorten your workout, reduce intensity, or just hit the gym.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**STAY HYDRATED, Seriously:** With temperatures climbing fast and breezy conditions, dehydration is a real risk. Drink more water than you think you need, before, during, and after your workout. Electrolytes wouldn't hurt either.
