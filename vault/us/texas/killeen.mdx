Today's not the day to push it hard outside, Killeen, unless you enjoy coughing up a lung or battling a pollen-induced existential crisis.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Pollen Apocalypse:** We're sitting at "Very High" pollen levels. If you have allergies, your body is already fighting a losing battle out there. Even if you don't, that much crap in the air isn't doing your respiratory system any favors.</li>
  <li>**Ozone's a Real Buzzkill:** Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is a 68, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. That means the air quality is "Poor" for sensitive groups and could lead to throat irritation, headaches, and chest pain for anyone really pushing themselves. Don't confuse "clear skies" with "clean air."</li>
  <li>**Ongoing Roadwork & Park Maintenance:** While no new, major workout-stopping hazards like wildfires or floods cropped up in the last 24 hours, keep in mind there are still ongoing closures and planned maintenance. For instance, Chaparral Road has been experiencing lane closures through March 6 for watermain installation, which can affect local traffic and detours, even if it's not directly on a trail. Plus, look out for Killeen Athletic Complex parking closures for restriping in early March.</li>

## Environmental Breakdown

| Pollutant          | Level          | Health Impact (General)                                       |
| :----------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pollen**         | Very High      | Significant irritation for allergy sufferers.                   |
| **AQI**            | 68 (Moderate)  | Unhealthy for sensitive groups; reduce outdoor exertion. |
| **Dominant Pollutant** | Ozone          | Can aggravate respiratory diseases, throat irritation, headaches, chest pain. |
| **Temperature**    | 15.7°C (60°F)  | Comfortable, but don't let it fool you about air quality.      |
| **Condition**      | Clear          | Visually appealing, but deceiving given the air quality.      |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Pollen Bomb Incoming (or Already Here):** With "Very High" pollen levels, your lungs are going to feel it. If you're planning a run on the Pepper Creek Hike & Bike Trail, expect to be sneezing your way through it. Consider an indoor workout if your allergies are usually bad.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Ozone Alert for Sensitive Lungs:** An AQI of 68, driven by Ozone, means the air is "Poor" for anyone with asthma, emphysema, or other respiratory issues. Even if you're a seasoned runner, pushing hard in these conditions isn't smart. You could be risking throat irritation, headaches, or chest pain. Seriously, ease up.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  If you absolutely *must* get outside, aim for early morning when pollen might be slightly lower and ozone hasn't had all day to cook in the sunlight. Keep your route shorter, and hydrate like it's your job. And for the love of all that is holy, take an antihistamine if you need one.
