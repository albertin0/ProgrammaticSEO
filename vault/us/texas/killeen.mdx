Today is one of those days where Killeen seems to be actively working against your outdoor workout plans. Don't say I didn't warn you.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today isn't exactly prime for pounding the pavement:

<BulletList>
*   Your allergies are going to hate you. Pollen levels are still in the "Very High" range, thanks to all that lovely cedar doing its thing. Expect to be a snotty, watery-eyed mess if you push it too hard outside.
*   That "Moderate" AQI of 70? Yeah, it's mostly ozone, and for anyone with sensitive lungs or asthma, that's not just a suggestion to take it easy, it's a direct order from your respiratory system.
*   It's a bit too warm for February, hitting 25.3°C (77.5°F). Combine that with the pollen and ozone, and you're just asking for an uncomfortable session.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The sun's out, it's "clear," and you want to get your miles in. But if you're planning on hitting the trails around **Lion's Club Park** or just going for a run down the recently maintained Leifester Circle, you need to be smart about it.

### Allergy Alert: Pollenocalypse Continues
Seriously, the tree pollen is through the roof. If you're one of the unfortunate souls who gets "cedar fever" this time of year, today is not your day to be a hero. Pop your meds *before* you even think about stepping out, keep your workout shorter than usual, and maybe stick to an indoor track if you have access. Otherwise, prepare for the Killeen pollen to kick your sinuses square in the face.

### Ozone: The Invisible Lung Punch
That AQI of 70 isn't "Good." It's "Moderate," and the dominant pollutant is ozone. For those with respiratory issues, or even healthy individuals doing prolonged exertion, this means potential chest tightness and reduced lung function. If you start feeling it, cut your workout short. This isn't a badge of honor; it's your body telling you to chill out.

### Construction & Road Works
While there aren't any massive, trail-blocking disasters to report today, the city's always doing *something*. Road maintenance was just planned for Leifester Circle on the 25th, and some punch-list items for Bunny Trail Road reconstruction are ongoing through February. Keep an eye out for unexpected detours or uneven surfaces, especially if you're running or cycling on city streets. Stay aware of your surroundings; Killeen drivers are, shall we say, "attentive" on their best days.

### Hydration is Key, Even if It's "Just Warm"
At 25.3°C (77.5°F), it's easy to underestimate how quickly you can dehydrate, especially with any exertion. Carry water, and drink it. Don't wait until you're already feeling parched.
