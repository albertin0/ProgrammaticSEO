Look, if you absolutely *have* to get outside in Killeen today, February 26th, you better be okay with choking down pollen, dodging construction cones, and keeping an eye out for smoke. It's not the best day, folks.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Your Lungs Will Hate You:** Pollen levels are through the roof. We're talking "Very High." Couple that with a moderate AQI where ozone is the dominant pollutant, and you're essentially signing up for an asthmatic's nightmare.
*   **Watch for Flames (Seriously):** We've got an elevated wildfire risk across Central Texas today and tomorrow, thanks to dry conditions and those lovely Killeen winds gusting up to 20 mph. Remember that grill fire on Aquila Drive just two days ago that spread like wildfire due to high winds? Yeah, that. The Killeen Fire Department isn't messing around; they're telling people to skip outdoor grilling. If they're telling you to put away the BBQ, maybe rethink that long trail run.
*   **Roads Aren't Your Friend:** Construction continues to be a pain. If your route involves Chaparral Road between Trimmier Road and Taylor Renee Drive, forget about it. The eastbound lane is closed for watermain work through March 6th. Good luck finding a clear path. Even Bunny Trail Road, which recently reopened, still has "punch-list items" and landscaping work happening through February, so don't expect it to be perfectly pristine. And if you were planning a playground workout at Long Branch Park, that's closing March 2-7 for surfacing upgrades.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Level | Dominant Types |
| :----------- | :------------- |
| Very High    | Oak, Juniper   |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Fire Danger:** The combination of low humidity, dry vegetation, and breezy winds means any spark, no matter how small, can turn into a serious problem fast. Stay vigilant and report anything suspicious.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Respiratory Irritation Ahead:** With "Very High" pollen and "Moderate" AQI due to ozone, anyone with allergies, asthma, or other respiratory conditions should seriously reconsider exercising outside. Stick to the treadmill, your lungs will thank you.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration is Key:** While it's clear and not scorching, the temperature is hitting the low 80s, which can sneak up on you, especially with that Texas humidity. Drink more water than you think you need.
