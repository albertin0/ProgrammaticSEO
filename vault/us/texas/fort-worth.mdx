Looks like Mother Nature decided to play a cruel joke on our lungs today, Fort Worth.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Your allergies are already screaming.** Tree pollen levels are absolutely through the roof, sitting firmly in the "Very High" category. Don't even think about it if you usually get hit hard.
*   **The air quality is mediocre at best.** With an AQI of 70 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, you'll be breathing in more than just that sweet, sweet pollen. Sensitive groups, consider yourselves warned.
*   **Wildfire risk is elevated.** North winds are kicking up, and along and west of Highway 281, there's an elevated fire threat. Any smoke that pops up will make that already questionable air quality even worse.
</BulletList>

Alright, Fort Worth, let's talk turkey. Today's one of those days where you really gotta ask yourself if that PR is worth the snot, tears, and potential lung damage. We're looking at a decent 17.8°C (around 64°F) and clear skies, which *sounds* lovely for a run or a ride along the Trinity Trails. But peel back that pretty facade, and it's a mess out there for anyone with a respiratory system or even just a mild aversion to discomfort.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level       |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| Tree        | Very High   |
| Grass       | Very Low    |
| Weeds       | No values   |

Seriously, "Very High" tree pollen isn't a suggestion, it's a damn warning. We're talking over 2250 grains per cubic meter, and it's holding steady at that ridiculous level today. If your nose is already running a marathon before you even tie your shoes, take a hint.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads up, allergy sufferers!** That "Very High" tree pollen count isn't messing around. Expect major irritation. Consider an indoor workout or double-dose your antihistamines if you're stubborn.

And then there's the air itself. An AQI of 70 with ozone as the main offender means that even if your sinuses are miraculously clear, your lungs are still getting a workout they didn't sign up for. "Fair" air quality is for fair-weather athletes, not for those of us trying to actually get some decent oxygen.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Elevated Fire Threat!** The north winds are strong enough to spread any brush fires quickly, especially west of Highway 281. If you see smoke, don't play hero. Turn around. Air quality can go from 'meh' to 'hazardous' in a blink with wildfire smoke.
</AlertBox>

Now, for those of you eyeing a scenic jog or bike ride on the Trinity Trails, keep in mind we had some pretty significant flooding in the metroplex back in mid-February. While the major flooding is long gone, there's always a chance of lingering muddy patches or even some eroded sections, especially near the river banks. A little mud won't kill you, but a twisted ankle when you're already wheezing from the pollen and ozone is just adding insult to injury. Also, general construction around the I-30 and I-35 corridors means you might hit unexpected detours or find debris if your route gets too close to those areas. Stay alert.

Look, I get it. The sun's out, the temperature is mild, and the couch is calling your name a little too loudly. But sometimes, discretion is the better part of valor (and not blowing out your sinuses or breathing in crap). Maybe hit the gym today, or at least keep your outdoor session short and slow. Your lungs and joints will probably thank you for it.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip:** If you absolutely *must* run outside, aim for early morning before pollen counts hit their peak and ozone has had all day to bake. And for the love of all that is holy, bring some water, probably an inhaler, and definitely some tissues.
