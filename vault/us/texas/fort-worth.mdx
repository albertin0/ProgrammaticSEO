Forget about setting any PRs today, Fort Worth. Your lungs are going to hate you more than a stray dog hates a leash.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Pollenocalypse Now:** "Very High" pollen is the headliner, and it's going to make every breath a struggle for anyone with allergies. Cedar, Elm, and Ragweed are likely going full assault mode.
*   **Windy with a Chance of Wheezing:** Those "breezy" conditions, with gusts up to 20 mph, mean all that delightful pollen gets kicked up and stays airborne longer, right into your airways.
*   **Sneaky Particulates:** While the overall AQI is "Good" at 39, the dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Combine that with the pollen and wind, and you've got a recipe for respiratory irritation, even if you don't typically struggle with air quality.

### Today's Rundown

It's clear and sitting at a pleasant 20.5°C (that's about 69°F for the folks still clinging to Fahrenheit). Sounds lovely on paper, right? But Mother Nature in North Texas often has a cruel sense of humor. The dry, breezy air is perfect for stirring up the copious amounts of pollen we're currently experiencing. Your eyes will itch, your nose will run, and your lungs will feel like you've been chain-smoking cedar trees.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Respiratory Rant:** Seriously, if you've got asthma, seasonal allergies, or any other respiratory issues, take this "Very High" pollen warning to heart. Consider moving your workout indoors or sticking to very low-intensity activities. The PM2.5 isn't helping, either. Don't be a hero; nobody wants to deal with your coughing fit on the Trinity Trails.

### Local Hazards to Watch For

Beyond the airborne irritants, there are a few other things to keep in mind.

*   **Lingering Wet Spots:** While the major flooding from a couple of weeks ago (remember that Valentine's Day mess?) has cleared from most main roads, areas along the Trinity River Basin might still have some damp, muddy patches. If you're hitting the trails down there, watch your step. The Fort Worth Fire Department was still dealing with high-water calls not too long ago.
*   **Construction Chaos:** Keep an eye out if you're driving or cycling near Loop 820. There are ongoing overnight closures for reconstruction between Beach Street and Rufe Snow Drive through today. And let's be honest, construction dust adds another layer of fun to that PM2.5 problem. The City of Fort Worth also lists various other road closures for ongoing projects, so plan your routes and expect potential detours.
*   **Festival Fun (or Folly):** The Fort Worth Music Festival is kicking off today and running through March 1st at The Stockyards. If your route takes you anywhere near there, expect extra crowds, traffic, and general hubbub. Probably not ideal for a peaceful long run.

**Pro Tip:** Your clothes, hair, and even your dog will be coated in pollen after an outdoor excursion today. Consider showering immediately and washing your workout gear to minimize continued exposure. And maybe a nasal rinse wouldn't hurt.

### Pollen Breakdown (Because Misery Loves Company)

| Pollen Type | Level (Likely) | Impact |
| :---------- | :------------- | :----- |
| Cedar       | High           | Sneezing, itchy eyes, runny nose, congestion |
| Elm         | High           | Similar to Cedar, respiratory irritation |
| Ragweed     | Moderate-High  | Severe allergic reactions for many |
| Grasses     | Low-Moderate   | General allergy symptoms |

All that said, the temperature is great for being outside... if you can breathe. Just be smart about it, Fort Worth.
