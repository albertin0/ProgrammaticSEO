Today's a mixed bag, Denton runners, mostly good news if your allergies are under control, but keep an eye on the air.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   "Very High" pollen counts mean your sinuses are probably already screaming. Good luck out there; you'll need it.
*   While the air quality index (AQI 63) sits in the "Moderate" zone, the dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm). This isn't exactly a hug for your lungs, especially when your allergies are already in overdrive.
*   Warm, clear weather at a lovely 24.4°C (76°F) is nearly perfect for getting outside, but expect some moderate winds with gusts potentially up to 20 mph.
</BulletList>

## The Rundown for Denton:

Let's be blunt: if you suffer from seasonal allergies, today is going to be a miserable slog. The "Very High" pollen levels are no joke, and while I commend your dedication, sometimes the smart play is to hit the treadmill or find an allergy-friendly indoor activity. Your lungs will thank you.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Allergy Sufferers, Beware:** With pollen levels hitting "Very High," your outdoor workout on trails like the **Ray Roberts Greenbelt Corridor** could turn into a snot-filled nightmare. Consider an indoor alternative or heavily medicate before you head out. Don't be that person stopping every five minutes to blow your nose into a Kleenex you suddenly regret bringing.
</AlertBox>

On the air quality front, we're sitting at an AQI of 63, which technically falls into the "Moderate" category. However, the dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter. This stuff can get deep into your lungs, and when combined with a "Very High" pollen count, it's a recipe for respiratory discomfort for anyone sensitive, not just those with full-blown asthma. AccuWeather actually lists today's air quality as "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups," so listen to your body if things feel off.

Weather-wise, the day is clear and warm at 24.4°C (76°F), which sounds ideal, right? Just keep in mind that we're looking at north-northeast winds generally around 5 to 10 mph, but with gusts that could push up to 20 mph. These aren't hurricane-force winds, but they can still kick up dust, pollen (surprise!), and loose debris on less-maintained parts of the trail.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Elevated Wildfire Threat:** Denton and much of North Texas are currently under an elevated wildfire threat due to persistently low humidity, warm temperatures, and those moderate winds we just talked about. These conditions make it easier for fires to start and spread. Stay hyper-vigilant, avoid anything that could spark a blaze (no discarded cigarettes, people!), and if you see smoke, report it immediately.
</AlertBox>

No significant construction or trail closures have been reported for the last 24 hours impacting our major running routes like the DCTA A-train Rail Trail, which was completed years ago. So, at least you won't be rerouted into a construction zone. But seriously, hydrate, consider a mask if your allergies are bad, and be aware of your surroundings.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Watch Your Step on Gusty Days:** Winds up to 20 mph are expected today. This means leaves, small branches, and other random crap can be blowing around, creating tripping hazards, especially on more natural or less-maintained paths. Keep an eye on the ground, secure your gear, and stay hydrated in the pleasant but breezy warmth.
