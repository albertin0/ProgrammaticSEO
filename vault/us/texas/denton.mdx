Today is a prime example of why you can't just trust the sunshine; what's in the air matters. Don't be a hero out there.

<BulletList>
*   **Pollen Armageddon:** Look, if your nose isn't already itching, give it five minutes. "Very High" pollen isn't just a suggestion; it's a threat. Cedar/Juniper, Elm, and Ash are having a party in your respiratory system.
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** An AQI of 70 is sitting squarely in "Moderate," with Nitrogen dioxide being the main culprit. It's not a red flag, but it's not exactly crisp mountain air either. Sensitive lungs, take note.
*   **Fire Risk Lingers:** While our immediate air quality isn't showing smoke, North Texas has seen wildfires recently, and Denton's fire risk remains moderate with dry conditions. Keep an eye out, especially with those 10-15 mph winds.

You might be looking out the window at that 15.7°C (around 60°F) and clear skies, thinking it's a perfect day to hit the trails at **Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center**. And visually, sure. But your lungs are going to disagree vehemently. We've got a potent cocktail of pollen and slightly elevated air pollution just waiting to assault your airways.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Allergy Attack Imminent:** With pollen levels in the "Very High" category, this is a terrible day for anyone prone to seasonal allergies or exercise-induced asthma. Even if you don't usually suffer, a sustained hard effort in this stuff is asking for trouble. Consider an indoor workout, or at the very least, take your antihistamines *before* you even lace up. And for the love of all that is holy, shower and change immediately after to get that pollen off you.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type       | Level     | Notes                                   |
| :---------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Overall           | Very High | Expect significant irritation.          |
| Cedar/Juniper     | High      | Known for aggressive allergy symptoms.  |
| Elm               | High      | Common allergen this time of year.      |
| Ash               | High      | Contributes heavily to overall count.   |

**AQI & Lung Health:** An AQI of 70 isn't going to kill you, but when combined with "Very High" pollen, it creates a pretty irritating environment. If you're going for a run, maybe scale back the intensity. This isn't the day to try for a PR, especially if you have any underlying respiratory issues. And remember, that Nitrogen dioxide can be worse near busy roads, so sticking to less trafficked areas might offer a slight reprieve.

Yesterday saw some pretty stout winds, with gusts up to 37 mph recorded in Denton. While today's winds are forecast to be a milder 10 to 15 mph from the NNE, that's still enough to keep stirring up all that delightful pollen and could potentially contribute to the spread of any grass fires that might spark up in our dry conditions. Seriously, don't be flicking cigarette butts out your car window. This isn't the year to add "wildfire evacuee" to your running resume.

No major trail closures or flooding warnings were reported in the last 24 hours that would directly block your path on places like the Greenbelt or other popular spots. But as always, stay vigilant, especially if you're hitting lesser-used trails that might not be as well-maintained.

My advice? If you absolutely *have* to get outside, keep it short, keep it easy, and make sure you're prepared for the onslaught of allergens. Otherwise, maybe it's a good day for the treadmill or some strength work in your living room. Your lungs will thank you.
