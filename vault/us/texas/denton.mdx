Today? If you *really* have to, I guess. Just don't blame me when your lungs feel like a vacuum bag full of cottonwood and your knees are protesting the nitrogen dioxide.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Pollen Apocalypse Now:** Look, the "Very High" pollen count isn't just a suggestion, it's a *threat*. Cedar, oak, ragweed – the whole gang is out to get you. Your nose will run, your eyes will itch, and you'll question every life choice that led you to run outside in Denton today.
*   **Lung Punch from the Air:** AQI is clocking in at 77 with Nitrogen dioxide as the star pollutant. That's "Moderate," which sounds fine until you're huffing and puffing down the Greenbelt Corridor and wondering why your throat feels like sandpaper. If you've got any kind of respiratory issues, seriously, stay inside.
*   **Warm Up, Blow Down:** We're looking at clear skies and a pleasant 16°C (about 61°F) right now, but it's heating up fast to the lower 80s (around 27-28°C) later today. Add some south winds increasing to 10-15 mph in the afternoon, and you're not just running, you're fighting a hairdryer on legs. Hydration is key, unless you fancy passing out on a sidewalk.

### Local Hazard Rundown

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### The Air is Not Your Friend Today
With "Very High" pollen and a "Moderate" AQI, your respiratory system is going to be working overtime. If you feel any chest tightness, shortness of breath, or excessive coughing, *stop*. This isn't a badge of honor; it's your body telling you to cut it out. Kids, the elderly, and anyone with asthma or allergies should probably opt for an indoor workout or just binge-watch something.
</AlertBox>

No major, immediate, widespread alerts for severe weather in Denton County itself for today. The NWS forecast for Denton County indicates mostly clear conditions with a less than 20 percent chance of showers this morning. So, you probably won't get rained on, but you *will* be inhaling half the plant kingdom.

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Construction Zone Chaos
Ongoing construction projects around Denton mean your usual routes might be unexpectedly blocked or re-routed. For example, North Bernard Street reconstruction and Panhandle Street pavement replacement are still in full swing, impacting traffic flow and potentially sidewalks. Denton County also recently approved intersection improvements at FM407 and I-35W, which are expected to begin in February and take about 100 days. Always keep an eye out for cones, barriers, and distracted drivers. Assume they don't see you.
</AlertBox>

The Denton Natatorium is also closed for repairs until March 22, 2026, so if you were planning on an indoor swim, you're out of luck there.

<AlertBox type="info">
#### Greenbelt Corridor & Trail Conditions
While there aren't any current widespread trail closures due to recent incidents within the last 24 hours, remember that the Elm Fork of the Trinity River and the Greenbelt Corridor can be susceptible to flooding during heavy rains. Always check local Denton Parks and Rec updates before heading out, especially after any significant rainfall. No news is good news, mostly, but past log jams have caused issues. Today, the bigger battle will be with the air itself, not submerged trails.
</AlertBox>

If you insist on running, wear a hat, sunglasses, and maybe even a mask if you're sensitive to pollen. Stay hydrated, keep your head on a swivel for traffic and construction, and be prepared to cut your workout short if your lungs start staging a rebellion.
