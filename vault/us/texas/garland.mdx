Don't even think about hitting those trails hard today, Garland. Your lungs will hate you, and your route might be blocked.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today isn't the day (unless you're an indoor enthusiast)

<BulletList>
*   **Your lungs will thank you for staying inside.** The Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a grumpy 71, with Nitrogen dioxide being the dominant jerk in the air. AccuWeather specifically calls today's air "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups". Mix that with the high pollen count, and you've got a perfect storm for wheezing.
*   **Pollen. So much pollen.** We're talking high levels of Cedar/Juniper, Elm, and Ash today. If you've got allergies, you already know. If you don't, today might be the day you find out.
*   **Downtown is a maze.** Forget trying to weave through Downtown Garland for your tempo run. Construction on State Street (between Sixth and Fifth) and Fifth Street (between Main and State) means significant closures. You'll spend more time dodging barriers than actually running.

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

| Pollutant           | AQI (Level) | Health Impact                                                                    |
| :------------------ | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overall AQI**     | 71 (Moderate) | Unhealthy for sensitive groups                                         |
| **Dominant Pollutant** | Nitrogen dioxide | Increases risk of respiratory problems, poor quality                   |
| **Pollen Level**    | High        | Cedar/Juniper, Elm, and Ash are prevalent. Expect allergy symptoms. |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Wind Advisory - Mostly Passed, but Stay Aware:** While official active warnings for Garland aren't showing up as "current" right now, a wind advisory was in effect earlier today for portions of North Central and Northeast Texas, with south winds gusting up to 35 mph. If you're out there, expect some stiff headwinds, especially on open routes like near Lake Ray Hubbard or the Rowlett Creek Trailhead. Unsecured objects can become projectiles, so watch your step and keep that hat on tight.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Don't Be a Downtown Daredevil:** Seriously, the ongoing construction in Downtown Garland is more than just an inconvenience; it's a hazard. With closures on State Street and Fifth Street, you're looking at uneven surfaces, heavy machinery, and unexpected detours. Your PR isn't worth a twisted ankle or worse. Find another route.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate:** Even with cooler temps (around 14.2°C/57°F and clear skies), the combination of high pollen and moderate air pollution means your body is working harder. Keep that water bottle handy, especially if you insist on pushing through.
</AlertBox>

Look, the weather might feel decent, but the air quality and pollen are out to get you today. Seriously consider an indoor workout, or at least stick to a neighborhood loop with good tree cover to mitigate some of that wind and direct sun, far from downtown's chaos. And if you're sensitive to air quality or pollen, just don't. Your lungs will send you a thank-you card later.
