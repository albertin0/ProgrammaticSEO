Alright, Garland, if you're thinking of hitting the pavement or dirt today, you better bring your A-game and maybe an extra set of lungs, because it's not exactly prime conditions out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>

*   That "High" pollen count isn't just a suggestion; it's a full-on assault for anyone prone to seasonal allergies or asthma. Expect a delightful mix of sniffles, sneezes, and that lovely post-run phlegm.
*   Our air quality is sitting at a moderate 72 AQI, primarily due to ozone. For the average Joe, it's probably fine, but if you've got sensitive lungs or plan on really pushing it, you might feel it. Don't be a hero.
*   The city's embarking on a massive street and alley overhaul with the Proposition A projects, meaning roads across Garland are basically obstacle courses right now. We're talking $210 million worth of torn-up asphalt and concrete through 2030, so expect detours, uneven surfaces, and a healthy dose of dust.

</BulletList>

Look, the temperature at 16.9°C (around 62°F) and clear skies sound inviting, I get it. It's that classic "Spring is trying to happen but Mother Nature forgot her allergy meds" kind of day. But don't let the pleasant weather fool you into thinking it's a free pass. Your respiratory system is already going to be working overtime thanks to that **high pollen count**, which means every breath is a battle against microscopic invaders. Then you layer on the **moderate ozone levels** – that's just unnecessary stress on your airways, especially if you're pushing anything beyond a casual stroll.

### The Great Garland Dig-Up

If your workout involves any city streets, be prepared for a gauntlet of construction. Garland City Council adopted plans for "year one" of Proposition A projects this February, kicking off an extensive street and alley rehabilitation and reconstruction program. That means *233 projects* are launching or ongoing, affecting everything from asphalt overlays to full street rebuilds. You'll be dodging cones, navigating temporary detours, and probably breathing in more than just pollen and ozone. My knees already ache just thinking about running on those uneven surfaces.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up, Road Warriors:** Expect significant disruptions on city streets and alleys due to the ongoing Proposition A construction projects. Watch out for uneven pavement, heavy equipment, and unexpected closures. This isn't just an inconvenience; it's a legitimate injury risk. Plan your routes carefully, or better yet, seek out dedicated trail systems.
</AlertBox>

Even if you're a nature lover, you're not entirely in the clear. Over at **Spring Creek Forest Preserve**, crews are conducting sewer inspections in "early 2026." While the city says parks and trails are "expected to remain open," you might still encounter personnel and equipment. Keep an eye out and be respectful of their work. Also, remember the city's general "Trail Development Program" has an anticipated construction end of "Mid 2026" for some trails like Duck Creek Central Trail, so expect potential disruptions there too.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro-Tip for Pollen Sufferers:** Hit your run early in the morning or later in the evening when pollen counts tend to be lower. Shower immediately when you get home to wash off any lingering allergens, and for the love of all that is holy, take your allergy meds *before* you head out.

So, can you work out outside today? Technically, yes. Should you? That's between you, your lungs, and your physical therapist (me, just saying). If you do, stay smart, be aware of your surroundings, and maybe don't set any PRs today. Your body will thank you.
