Look, if you're not planning to do an indoor gym session today, you're going to be fighting against Mother Nature's microscopic airborne artillery.

<BulletList>
*   That "Very High" pollen count isn't just a suggestion; it's a full-on assault on your sinuses, especially with various tree pollens blooming right now. If your nose is already running like a faucet and your eyes itch, you know the drill.
*   The Air Quality Index is currently sitting at a moderate 72, with Nitrogen dioxide flagged as the dominant pollutant. While it might look okay on paper, for anyone with sensitive lungs or existing respiratory issues, this could feel a lot closer to "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" as some other local reports suggest.
*   Don't expect to just roll up to Erwin Park and hit every single trail without a hitch; major renovation is kicking off this spring (which is, you know, now), closing campsites and pavilions for about a year. While the DORBA bike paths aren't directly part of the project, temporary closures due to nearby construction are a real possibility, so check the city's parks page before you head out.

## Today's Environmental Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level       |
|-------------|-------------|
| Tree Pollen | Very High   |
| Grass Pollen| Low         |
| Weed Pollen | Low         |

The weather itself for McKinney today is clear with temperatures around 13.8°C (around 57°F) this morning, but it's expected to warm up significantly into the low 80s Fahrenheit (around 27°C) later in the day. That sounds lovely, but it also means those pollutants and allergens will be hanging around, cooking in the warmer air.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Allergy Attack Incoming:** With "Very High" tree pollen, anyone prone to allergies is in for a rough time. Plan your outdoor activities for later in the day, or better yet, opt for an indoor workout at a place like 24 Hour Fitness or Anytime Fitness if you want to avoid the misery entirely.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Lungs:** An AQI of 72, with Nitrogen dioxide as the main player, means you should be mindful of lung irritation. Sensitive individuals, including children, older adults, and those with respiratory conditions, should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Erwin Park Update:** Starting this spring (a.k.a. now), Erwin Park is undergoing a major renovation project that will last approximately one year. Campsites and pavilions will be closed. While the Dallas Off-Road Bicycle Association (DORBA) maintained bike paths and skills courses aren't directly impacted, *some sections could be temporarily closed due to nearby construction*. Always check the official McKinney Parks and Recreation website for the latest closure information before loading up the bike.

**Critter Watch:** Remember, McKinney's parks and trails, including natural wooded areas, are home to wildlife, snakes included. While a good sign of a healthy ecosystem, always be cautious, keep an eye on where you're stepping, and give any snakes you encounter plenty of space.
