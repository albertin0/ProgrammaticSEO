If you're looking to crush a new PR today, you might just be crushing your lungs instead.

<BulletList>
*   **Pollen Apocalypse:** We're talking "Very High" pollen today, folks. Your sinuses are already staging a rebellion just thinking about it. Anyone with allergies or asthma, consider this your official indoor workout pass.
*   **Hazy Lung Day:** AQI is clocking in at 68, which is "Moderate," but don't let that fool you into thinking it's great. The dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter, likely helped along by those "light density residual smoke aerosols" from scattered burning activities across the region yesterday. So, yeah, you're not just breathing pollen; you're getting a side of microscopic crud.
*   **Construction Zone:** If you're planning on hitting Erwin Park, be aware that renovations are kicking off this spring. Campsites and pavilions are closing, and while the DORBA bike trails aren't directly impacted, "some sections could be temporarily closed due to nearby construction". Don't be surprised if your usual loop has an unexpected detour or a lovely soundtrack of heavy machinery.

Look, I get it. It's 25.5°C (that's pushing 78°F for you Celsius-challenged folks) and clear out there. It *looks* inviting. But if your idea of a good run involves feeling like you've snorted a handful of ragweed while simultaneously sucking down exhaust fumes, then by all means, lace up. For the rest of us, that "moderate risk of fire" in McKinney today combined with the existing air quality means your respiratory system is already working overtime before you even start moving.

<AlertBox type="warning">
That "Very High" pollen count is no joke. If you have seasonal allergies, this kind of day can trigger significant symptoms, including sneezing, congestion, watery eyes, and even asthma flare-ups. Know your triggers and carry your meds if you dare venture outside.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
Even with a "Moderate" AQI, sensitive groups (that's you, asthma sufferers, and anyone with heart or lung conditions) might experience symptoms from fine particulate matter. Consider shifting your run to a treadmill or heading to an indoor track at a place like Planet Fitness on Central Expy if your lungs are already protesting.
</AlertBox>

So, yeah, it's not the worst day ever to be outside, but it's far from ideal for an intense workout, especially if you value clear lungs and non-itchy eyes. Consider that new renovation work at Erwin Park; maybe it's a sign to renovate your workout plans today too.
