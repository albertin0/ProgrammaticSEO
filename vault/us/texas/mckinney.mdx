Look, the weather's cooperating, but your lungs might be staging a rebellion if you're hitting the trails today.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   Spring has sprung, and so has the pollen, hitting "High" across McKinney. Your sinuses will thank you for taking it easy.
*   AQI is sitting at 69, which isn't awful, but with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) as the dominant pollutant, adding high pollen to that mix is a double-whammy for your respiratory system.
*   Construction around town is a never-ending saga, meaning detours and unexpected hazards could mess with your flow.

## Your Lungs vs. McKinney's Air Today

It's a clear, decent 15.9°C (that's a comfortable 60 degrees Fahrenheit for those of us who prefer freedom units), so your muscles and joints are probably ready to go. But before you lace up those Hokas and head out the door, take a deep breath. Actually, maybe don't. The pollen count is officially "High," and if you're prone to seasonal allergies, you're going to feel it. Add to that an Air Quality Index of 69, with fine particulate matter doing its thing, and you've got a recipe for a snotty, wheezy workout.

### Pollen Bomb Incoming
For anyone with asthma or severe allergies, today is a day to be extra cautious. Consider moving your workout indoors or sticking to very light activity outside. Don't be a hero; your lungs will pay for it. Even if you're usually fine, this combo can sneak up on you.

## Construction Chaos Continues

If it's not the air trying to take you out, it's the infrastructure. McKinney is a city under constant construction, and that hasn't changed in the last 24 hours. There are significant projects affecting major arteries and local areas.

You’re going to run into ongoing work on US 380 for illumination and the lengthy Eldorado Parkway and Virginia Parkway rehabilitation project that's been messing with commutes since last summer. That means lane closures, uneven surfaces, and increased vehicle traffic trying to navigate the mess. Even if you're not driving, be aware of distracted drivers and unexpected changes to pedestrian paths. If you run near US 75, expect residual impacts from overnight mainlane paving closures that were happening until 5 AM this morning.

New construction grants are being discussed for areas like the McKinney Ranch Senior Living development and the Cotton Mill District, meaning even more long-term work is on the horizon or already underway. Even the McKinney National Airport is extending Runway 18/36 through October 2026, causing various operational changes and closures. Bottom line: if you're running a known route, be ready for detours or uneven footing.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Watch Your Step (and Your Back)
Major construction on roads like US 75, Eldorado, and Virginia Parkway means altered traffic patterns, potential heavy equipment, and sudden sidewalk closures. Stay vigilant, assume drivers don't see you, and always have a backup route. If you're hitting the trails at *Erwin Park*, you might be away from the immediate road chaos, but don't let your guard down on the way there.

### Heard Natural Science Museum & Wildlife Sanctuary
If your plan was to hit the trails at the Heard Natural Science Museum & Wildlife Sanctuary, be aware that their "Dinosaurs Live!" exhibit is still running through March 1st. While not a hazard in itself, it likely means more foot traffic than usual, especially on weekends, so be prepared for crowds if you head out there.

### Gear Up Smart
Despite the pollen, the clear skies and mild temperatures mean layering is your friend. Start warm, shed layers as you heat up. And always, always stay hydrated, especially when your body is working harder to filter out airborne irritants.
