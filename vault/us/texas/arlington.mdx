Alright, Arlington, if you're thinking of hitting the trails today, you're either a glutton for punishment or allergic to common sense.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   Your sinuses are going to stage a full-blown rebellion thanks to the "Very High" pollen count. I hope you've restocked your antihistamines, or you'll be running with a snot rocket factory attached to your face.
*   The AQI is clocking in at 70, pushing into the "Moderate" zone with nitrogen dioxide as the star pollutant. So, not only are you inhaling tree sperm, but you're getting a nice dose of exhaust fumes too. Great for lung capacity, I'm sure.
*   Don't expect a smooth ride if River Legacy Park is your usual stomping ground. Construction is *still* an ongoing saga there, with the grand finale for Phase II and the west connection projected for completion around January 2026 and April 2026 respectively. So, that "newly installed Trinity River pedestrian bridge" might be fresh, but other bits might still be a mess of detours and new pavement settling. Check before you head out, or embrace the mud and confusion.

## Today's Vitals

The weather itself is playing nice at a comfortable 17°C and clear skies, which is almost insulting given the airborne assault your respiratory system is about to endure. It's the kind of crisp, clear air that *looks* perfect but is secretly plotting against your immune system.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type  | Level     | Impact                                   |
| :----------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Overall      | Very High | Sneezing, itchy eyes, runny nose, asthma |

## Your Lungs Are Not Disposable

Look, I know you want to get your miles in, but today is not the day to set a PR, especially if you're prone to seasonal allergies or have any kind of respiratory sensitivity. That "Moderate" AQI with nitrogen dioxide isn't going to kill you instantly, but couple it with "Very High" pollen, and you're essentially signing up for an unnecessary lung workout on top of your leg workout. If you're doing any high-intensity intervals, you're just drawing more of that junk deep into your airways.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**River Legacy Park Trail Construction:** While sections of the River Legacy Park Trail, particularly Phase I, are reportedly open as of May 2025, ongoing work for Phase II and the west connection means you should anticipate detours, uneven surfaces, or recently opened sections that might still be a bit rough. Don't plan on a perfectly uninterrupted long run, and be prepared to pivot.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, if your favorite Arlington trail is under construction, don't just blindly follow a "closed" sign into the woods expecting a pristine detour. You'll likely end up in a muddy ditch or face-to-face with heavy machinery. And if you're out late, remember that "big cat" sighting mentioned near the Garner parking lot last fall. Keep your head on a swivel.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Consider the Treadmill or Indoors:** With pollen levels this high and a less-than-ideal AQI, today might be the perfect excuse to hit one of Arlington's indoor gyms. At least the air inside *should* be filtered, and you won't be fighting off a sneezing fit mid-stride.
</AlertBox>

If you absolutely *must* run outside, keep it short, keep it easy, and for the love of all that is holy, take an allergy pill *before* you step out. And bring tissues. Lots of tissues.
