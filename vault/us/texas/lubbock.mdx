Alright, Lubbock, let's talk about getting out there today. It's one of those days where the weather itself looks pretty inviting, but you still need to keep your head on a swivel.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality? Not exactly pristine. We're sitting at an AQI of 75, with ozone being the main offender. That's "moderate," meaning if your lungs are already finicky, you might feel it. Don't go trying to set any 5K PRs today if you're sensitive.</li>
  <li>Pollen count is blessedly low. Your sinuses can thank the universe for that small mercy.</li>
  <li>Construction is still a thing. Remember that massive 34th Street Bond Project? Yeah, the groundbreaking was just a few days ago, on February 23rd, stretching from Upland Avenue to Milwaukee Avenue, and it means ongoing road work. Also, don't forget the I-27 downtown lane closures near Broadway Street that are sticking around through April. If your route involves dodging orange cones or breathing dust from heavy machinery, reconsider.</li>

### A Word on Wildfires and What's Underfoot

While our skies are clear and the temperature is a comfortable 15.7°C (mid-60s for those of us who still think in Fahrenheit), let's not pretend we're in a bubble. The Texas Panhandle has been battling some serious wildfires this past week, fueled by extreme fire weather, low humidity, and wind gusts up to 60-65 mph. Red Flag Warnings were literally in place "down past Lubbock" recently. Smoke plumes were visible from space just a few days ago, causing visibility issues elsewhere.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Potential for Lingering Smoke/Dust:** Even if you can't see it, with that recent activity to our north and east, and the perennial Lubbock wind, there's always a chance for residual smoke particles or dust to be hanging around, contributing to that "moderate" air quality. Keep an eye (and nose) out, especially if you're hitting up the trails near Mae Simmons Park along the Canyon Lakes System, where you're more exposed to open air movement.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of Mae Simmons, or any of our other beloved unpaved routes: remember those "widespread rain and thunderstorms" we got around February 13th that caused "widespread street flooding"? And let's not forget the burst pipes and flood damage crews were dealing with back in late January after the winter blast. Just because it's clear today doesn't mean everything has magically dried out.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Trail Conditions:** Expect muddy patches, particularly in low-lying areas or sections that don't get much sun. Your ankles (and your laundry basket) will thank you for wearing appropriate footwear. Or, you know, just stick to the pavement. It's less exciting, but usually less messy.
</AlertBox>

Today is a decent day for a workout if you're not overly sensitive to air quality and you're mindful of where you're going. Choose your routes wisely to avoid construction zones and potentially muddy trails. Otherwise, enjoy the mild weather before it inevitably decides to pull another fast one on us.
