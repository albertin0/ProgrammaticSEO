Forget that "perfect day" nonsense; today in Lubbock is a full-on negotiation with the elements.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   Those warm, clear skies are a nice facade for the persistent south-southwest winds, gusting up to 35 mph. You'll be working overtime, whether you want to or not.
*   "Moderate" Air Quality, courtesy of ozone, means your lungs are going to feel every single mile. Don't expect any PRs today unless your previous record involved a dust storm.
*   Low pollen counts are a win, but let's be real, the wind will likely kick up enough other crud to make you question that victory.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

So, the trees are behaving, which is great if you usually sneeze your way through a run. But don't get too comfortable. This is Lubbock, and there's always something else trying to get into your airways.

<AlertBox type="warning">
## Wind Advisory (Self-Imposed)
The National Weather Service might not have a formal *advisory* out right now for sustained gales, but south-southwest winds at 21 mph, gusting to 35 mph, are no joke. This isn't just a gentle breeze to cool you down; it's a constant push, particularly if you're heading north or south. Expect increased effort, potential for blowing dust (especially if you're near any construction or unpaved areas), and for your hair to be a certified mess. Don't forget your hydration, because that wind dries you out fast.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
## Moderate AQI: Hello, Ozone!
Your air quality is sitting at a nice, solid 69 AQI, with ozone as the star of the show. For most people, this is just "moderate," but if you've got any kind of lung sensitivity—asthma, bronchitis, or you just enjoy breathing easily—you're going to notice this. Ozone irritates your respiratory system, making deep breaths harder and potentially triggering symptoms. It's not a stay-indoors emergency, but dial back the intensity, especially on those longer efforts. This isn't the day to go all-out on the Canyon Lake Trailway if you want to avoid feeling like you just smoked a pack.

<AlertBox type="info">
## Construction Ahead (Literally)
Keep an eye out for active or impending construction, especially if you regularly run or cycle near Upland Avenue between 34th and 50th Street. The city was just closing bids for a major reconstruction project there today. While it might not be a full-blown closure *today*, it means equipment, detours, and general road chaos are either happening or about to kick off. Always scout your routes, people. Don't assume your usual path is clear.
</AlertBox>

Overall, if you're hitting the pavement, acknowledge the conditions. It's not the worst day, but it's far from easy street. Listen to your body, cut your run short if the wind or the air starts getting to you, and for goodness sake, wear some sunscreen. It's still Texas.
