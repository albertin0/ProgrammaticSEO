Alright Mesquite, if you're eyeing an outdoor run today, February 26th, 2026, you're looking at a classic North Texas mixed bag – fantastic weather for your muscles, but your lungs are going to hate you.

<BulletList>
*   **Your Lungs are on High Alert:** High pollen counts are hitting us hard, and the air quality is sitting in the "Moderate" range with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as the dominant pollutant. This isn't just a DFW thing; the Texas Air Quality Forecast confirms PM2.5 levels may be elevated in our area. It's that familiar combination of regional wildfire haze drifting in from the Panhandle and local crap floating around. So, expect some wheezing and sneezing.
*   **Perfect Running Temps:** At a crisp 23.6°C (about 74.5°F) and clear skies, the weather itself is pretty prime for pounding the pavement without cooking yourself. Hydrate, obviously, but you won't be battling extreme heat or cold.
*   **Watch Your Step (and Traffic):** While the multi-use trail along Faithon P. Lucas Boulevard is practically finished, still keep an eye out around town. South Walker Street's got ongoing asphalt paving, meaning traffic shifts and potential annoyances for your route. Don't assume every construction zone from the past few months is completely cleared; things linger.

## The Respiratory Reality Check

Look, the clear skies are tempting, and 74 degrees feels like a gift in late February, but don't ignore what your body's telling you. That AQI of 75? It means "moderately polluted" and continuous exposure is not ideal for anyone, let alone someone pushing their cardiovascular system. Add in the "High" pollen, and you've got a recipe for an irritated respiratory system. If you're sensitive, you know the drill: stay inside, hit the treadmill, or at least keep your run short and easy.

### AQI & Pollen Combo Punch!
The moderate air quality (AQI 75, PM2.5 dominant) combined with high pollen means a double whammy for your lungs and airways. Consider reducing strenuous outdoor exercise, especially if you have asthma or other respiratory conditions. Filters work for coffee, not so much for high pollen and PM2.5 when you're sucking wind at your VO2 max.

### Today's Pollen Breakdown (Because you asked, kinda)

| Pollen Level | Dominant Types |
| :----------- | :------------- |
| High         | (No specific data on types, but assume your usual Texas spring suspects are waking up) |

<AlertBox type="info">
### Construction Zone Courtesy
If your usual route takes you near South Walker Street, be aware that asphalt paving is still ongoing, and traffic has shifted. Keep your head up, be predictable, and share the road. Those construction workers don't need a frantic runner adding to their headaches.

Run smart, Mesquite. Your lungs will thank you, eventually.
