Don't even think about skipping your allergy meds today, Mesquite. It's a prime example of why your "clear skies" enthusiasm needs a reality check.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Pollen Apocalypse:** We're talking "Very High" pollen levels. Your nose, throat, and eyes will hate you if you pretend like it's not an issue. Even if you don't typically sniffle, this kind of count will wear down anyone trying to get a decent breath in.</li>
  <li>**AQI is... fine, mostly:** An AQI of 71 with Nitrogen dioxide as the dominant pollutant isn't going to kill you outright, but it's firmly in the "Moderate" category. For most folks, it's just a bit hazy. For those with any kind of respiratory issues, though, you might notice it more than usual, especially coupled with that pollen.</li>
  <li>**Construction Shenanigans:** Spring 2026 means Mesquite is still a giant obstacle course, and the current roadwork can mess with your usual routes.</li>
</BulletList>

Today's one of those days where the weather itself looks inviting—14.3°C and clear skies—but the invisible enemies are out in full force. You might think it's a perfect day for a long run along the Mesquite Heritage Trail, but your body will argue otherwise if you're not prepared.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Pollen Bomb:** Seriously, take your antihistamines *before* you head out. A "Very High" pollen count is no joke. Your lungs and sinuses are already working overtime to deal with the Nitrogen dioxide; don't give them more reasons to revolt. If you're prone to asthma or seasonal allergies, keep your outdoor time shorter and maybe stick to later in the day when pollen might settle a bit.
</AlertBox>

### Watch Your Step (and Your Route)

Speaking of routes, if your usual jog takes you anywhere near Paza Drive, be aware. That stretch from Rupert Street to Wilkinson Drive is shut down for reconstruction until March 9th. They're doing paving, which means detours, potential dust, and definitely not a clear path for your run. It's part of the ongoing "Real. Texas. Roads." project, and while these improvements are eventually good, they're a headache right now. Don't get caught off guard trying to maintain your pace only to hit a "Road Closed" sign. Plan your route around it or be ready to get creative with your turns.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Visibility is Good, But Be Seen:** With clear conditions, drivers might be moving a little faster. If you're hitting the streets, wear bright colors, especially if you're running during dawn or dusk. Those construction zones also mean more equipment and distracted drivers.
</AlertBox>

Look, the sun is out, and it's not too hot, which is a rare enough treat in Texas. But if you insist on pushing it today, be smart about it. Your lungs and joints will thank you for respecting the pollen, the air, and the current state of Mesquite's roadways.
