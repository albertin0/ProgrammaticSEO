Don't be a hero today, Laredo. That mercury is climbing faster than your energy bill in July, and the air isn't doing your lungs any favors.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Heat's on the Horizon:** While it might feel nice right now at 20.2°C (68.4°F), don't get complacent. We're looking at a projected high around 31°C (88°F) today, and some forecasts even pushed yesterday's high to 100°F (37.8°C). That's not just "warm," that's "stupid hot for a workout."
*   **Watch for Wildfires & Wobbly Lungs:** The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 59 due to fine particulate matter. Texas is under a Level 3 Wildfire Preparedness, and Laredo specifically has an "Extreme Risk of Fire" today due to the hot, dry conditions. Even if you don't see a blaze on Loop 20, that smoke travels, and it'll make your lungs work harder than they should.
*   **Low Pollen, Small Victory:** At least your allergies probably won't be screaming at you. Pollen levels are low, which is about the only good news for your respiratory system today.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. You've got your routine. You want to hit the trails at Lake Casa Blanca International State Park, feel that fresh air. But "fresh" is a subjective term when the air's carrying fine particulate matter and the sun's trying to bake you alive. Hydration isn't just a suggestion; it's the difference between a good run and ending up a crispy critter on the side of the trail.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Extreme Heat Risk Today

The temperature is expected to soar, hitting highs of 31°C (88°F) or more. Dehydration and heat exhaustion are serious threats. If you must be outside, go early, go short, and listen to your body. Seriously, this isn't the day to push for a PR on your long run.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Air Quality & Fire Danger

With an AQI of 59, your lungs are already working a little harder. Add in the "Extreme Risk of Fire" around Laredo and ongoing wildfire activity in Texas, and you're breathing in more than just oxygen. If you've got any underlying respiratory issues, consider moving your workout indoors. We saw dense fog advisories for parts of the region earlier this morning, so if you're an *extremely* early bird, visibility could still be an issue too.

### Smart Moves for a Sketchy Day

*   **Adjust Your Schedule:** Seriously, early morning is your best bet before the heat and potential afternoon haze really kick in.
*   **Hydrate Like Your Life Depends On It:** Because it kind of does. Water, electrolytes. Lots of it.
*   **Dress for Success (or Survival):** Light-colored, moisture-wicking clothes are your friends.
*   **Know When to Call It:** If you feel dizzy, nauseous, or just generally crappy, stop. No workout is worth a trip to the ER.
