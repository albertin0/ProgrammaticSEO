You want to work out outside today, Laredo? Unless you're training for a desert survival show, probably not your best idea.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
*   **Record Heat Alert:** Today, Thursday, February 26th, we're projected to hit a brutal, record-setting 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which is absolutely not jogging weather.
*   **Moderate AQI:** With an AQI of 57 and fine particulate matter being the dominant pollutant, your lungs are already doing extra work, and throwing 100-degree heat on top of that is just asking for trouble.
*   **Texas-Wide Fire Risk:** While not directly in Laredo, "elevated-to-critical fire weather conditions" persist across parts of Texas, meaning that particulate matter in the air could be exacerbated by distant fires, even if you can't see the smoke.

Look, I get it. We runners are a stubborn bunch. You've got your route mapped out around North Central Park, maybe a quick loop past McPherson. But today isn't the day to prove your mettle against the sun. That projected 100°F high is *dangerous*. We're talking heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and generally feeling like you just ran through a blast furnace. Your body is going to be dumping sweat just trying to keep itself cool, let alone perform any kind of strenuous activity. Add in that fine particulate matter, and you're essentially breathing in tiny irritants while simultaneously trying not to overheat. It's a recipe for feeling absolutely miserable and potentially ending up in a bad spot.

### Extreme Heat Warning: Avoid Midday and Afternoon Outdoors
Today's forecast of a record-setting 100°F is no joke. If you *must* be outside, do it before 8 AM or after 7 PM, and even then, keep it short, hydrated, and listen to your body. This isn't just discomfort; it's a serious health risk.

Seriously, save the heroics for a cooler day. Your joints will thank you for not pounding the pavement when it's hot enough to cook an egg, and your lungs will appreciate not having to filter moderate particulates in oven-like conditions. There's no shame in moving your workout indoors or just taking a rest day. Planet Fitness on Calton Road is open 24/7, or maybe hit up Toxic Fitness for some CrossFit if you absolutely need to sweat it out. Better to live to run another day than to pass out trying to prove a point to a thermometer.

### Hydration is Non-Negotiable
If you insist on any outdoor activity, even a quick walk, carry more water than you think you need. Dehydration happens fast in Laredo heat, and today's going to be a prime example.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Keep an Eye on That AQI
While 57 isn't terrible, the presence of fine particulate matter means anyone with respiratory sensitivities should be extra cautious with outdoor exertion. It might not look smoky, but those tiny particles can still irritate your airways, especially when you're breathing hard in the heat.
