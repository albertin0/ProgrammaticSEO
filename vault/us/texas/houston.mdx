Today's one of those rare days Houston decides to play nice, so quit whining and get your workout in.

<LungsJointsScore score={9} />

### Why today IS the day:
<BulletList>
  * Your allergies get a break; pollen is practically nonexistent, so your nose won't be running more than you are.
  * That AQI is lower than my grocery bill this week, so your lungs are clear for takeoff.
  * The temperature is absolutely mint – a perfect mid-70s, so no excuses about melting or freezing your posterior off.

## The Rundown: Breathe Easy, But Stay Sharp

Look, I know we’ve had some rough patches this month with fire warnings and winds whipping around like a confused toddler. Just a few days ago, forecasters were talking about moderate to high fire danger and 15-25 mph gusts, which is less "workout weather" and more "stay inside and watch Netflix weather." Remember that Caddo Fire? Still out there, or at least it was, chewing up acres and making us all a little nervous.

But today, February 26th, Houston seems to have taken a chill pill. The air quality index is sitting pretty at 46, which is firmly in the "good" category. Dominant pollutant? Inhalable particulate matter, but at this low level, it's nothing to lose sleep over. This means you can hit the trails along Buffalo Bayou Park without feeling like you're running through a dust bowl or sucking down a campfire. The clear skies and comfortable 24.8°C (about 77°F) are practically an invitation to push that extra mile.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type     | Level    |
| --------------- | -------- |
| All Pollen      | Low      |

Seriously, "Low" pollen is a gift in this city. Your eyes won't be watering, your nose won't be itching, and you won't sound like you're trying to cough up a lung just from stepping outside.

### Don't Get Complacent: Fire Safety Still Matters
Even though the immediate fire risk has reportedly decreased as humidity has risen today, parts of our region were bone dry just a couple of days ago. The ground doesn't rehydrate overnight. If you're out near brush or dry grassy areas, especially if you're like me and run early mornings or late evenings when visibility can be tricky, stay vigilant. Don't toss anything, especially if it's still smoldering from your questionable breakfast burrito. We don't need to give the Houston Fire Department any extra work.

### Sun's Out, Guns Out (and SPF)
With clear skies and temps in the upper 70s, that Houston sun is no joke. Lather up with sunscreen, folks. And for the love of all that is holy, hydrate! It might not feel like scorching summer, but you'll still sweat your body weight in water if you're not careful. Carry a bottle, hit up the water fountains if they're actually working, or plan your route to swing by a convenience store for a refill.

So, lace up, get out there. Today's a good one for logging some serious mileage or just enjoying a walk without feeling like you're fighting the elements. Just don't be an idiot.
