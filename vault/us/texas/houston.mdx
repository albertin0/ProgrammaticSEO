## The Rundown: Don't Be a Fair-Weather Runner (Unless You Want To)

Look, February in Houston can be a crapshoot, but today? Today's a gift. The mercury's sitting at a comfortable 24°C (75°F) with clear skies, which means no excuses for skipping that run you've been putting off. We're looking at highs creeping into the mid-80s later today, so if you're planning an afternoon sweat session, it's going to feel warm.

Pollen counts are low, thank the gods, so your sinuses can relax. And the Air Quality Index is sitting pretty at 46, firmly in the "Good" category. While the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, it's at a level that shouldn't bother most folks. That said, some of that particulate matter might be residual smoke getting pushed up from south of the border, so if you're super sensitive, keep it in mind.

### Environmental Breakdown

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant                      | Temperature | Condition |
| :----------- | :-- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 46  | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) | 24°C (75°F) | Clear     |

## Hazards & Head-Ups

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Gusts, Buttercup!
While we're not talking hurricane force, expect some decent south winds today, clocking in around 10 mph with gusts up to 20 mph. If you're out on an exposed stretch like the Galveston Bay Trail or just doing laps around a wide-open park, you'll feel it. Cyclists, in particular, should be extra vigilant for crosswinds. Don't be that person who gets blown into traffic.

### Construction: The Eternal Houston Marathon Hazard
Surprise! More construction. If you're a regular on the White Oak Bayou Greenway, particularly between Houston Avenue and the Castillo Community Center, brace yourself. That section is **closed** starting January 15, 2026, and is expected to stay that way through 2028 due to the IH-45/I-10 connector ramp work. There are detours, but let's be real, they're rarely as good as the original. Also, don't forget the Brays Bayou Trail is still shut down at Spur 5 thanks to the ongoing SH 35 expansion. Plan your routes accordingly, or you'll be adding some unplanned mileage and a whole lot of frustration to your run.

### Weekend Rodeo Run Closures Approaching
Heads up for your weekend plans, especially if you hit Downtown. The Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo Run and Parade are happening Saturday, February 28. This means significant road closures starting as early as 2 AM Saturday morning, including parts of Memorial Drive and various I-45 exit ramps. Don't get caught in the pre-rodeo chaos if you're trying to get your long run in. Check the city's traffic updates before you head out.

Get out there and enjoy it, Houston. These perfect days don't last forever.
