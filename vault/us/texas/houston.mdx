It's a beautiful day to run outside in Houston, provided you know where *not* to run.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
- That 15.7°C (60°F) and clear sky? Chef's kiss, absolutely perfect for getting those miles in without melting. Pollen's also playing nice, sitting at a mercifully low level.
- But hold your horses, because while the air *looks* clear, the air quality is still hanging out in the "Moderate" range with an AQI of 56, thanks to inhalable particulate matter. Sensitive lungs, take note.
- And here’s the real kicker: Construction. So much construction. Plus, local events mean more blocked routes than usual. You'll need to plan your escape routes carefully.
</BulletList>

## The Air: Clear Skies, but Keep an Eye on That AQI

Don't let the postcard-perfect weather fool you entirely. While our notorious humidity is low and the sun is out, the Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 56. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), which means if you're sensitive to air pollution, you might feel it. You're probably fine for a short jaunt, but if you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, listen to your body and maybe dial back the intensity or duration of your outdoor session today. The TCEQ forecast mentioned slightly elevated PM2.5 levels for the region.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  Sensitive groups, pay attention to that moderate AQI. While "moderate" is generally acceptable, if you're prone to respiratory issues, today's particulate matter could cause some irritation. Consider an indoor workout or keeping your outdoor session shorter and less intense.

## Construction Chaos and Event Blockades: Your Houston Maze

Alright, this is where it gets real, Houston. You want to run? Good luck navigating the concrete jungle. TxDOT and the city are still going strong with projects, and today we've got a couple of events throwing extra wrenches into your plans.

First up, a major buzzkill for trail runners: The **White Oak Bayou Greenway (Little White Oak Bayou Trail)**, specifically the section between Houston Avenue and the Castillo Community Center, is closed. This isn't a temporary thing; it’s shut down from January 15, 2026, through 2028, due to the IH-45 southbound to I-10 westbound and I-10 eastbound to IH-45 northbound connector ramp work. Don’t even think about trying to sneak through; they've got detours posted, so follow 'em or find another trail.

Then there's the **Brays Bayou Trail** which is also seeing closures at Spur 5 due to the never-ending SH 35 expansion. That's another major artery for runners and cyclists that's currently a no-go.

And it’s not just the major bayous. Drivers already know the pain, but the **I-10 White Oak Bayou elevation project** near Studemont Street is causing lane reductions and delays that affect the general area, making any nearby street running less than ideal.

As if that wasn't enough, we've got events today:
*   The **Houston Holi Festival of Colors 2026** is shutting down lanes on Travis, Anita, and McGowen streets downtown from 10 AM to 6 PM.
*   The **HLSR BBQ Cook Off 2026** means closures around NRG Stadium on Lantern Point, Murworth, and Kirby.
*   And for those in the Heights, the **Heights-Norhill Little League Parade** will briefly block parts of the White Oak trail area this morning (10 AM - 10:30 AM) from Usener St to White Oak @ Micheaux to Euclid St.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  Seriously, do your homework before you head out. Major trail sections like parts of the White Oak Bayou Greenway and Brays Bayou Trail are closed indefinitely or for extended periods. Trying to bypass these will put you directly into active construction zones or heavy traffic.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  Today requires extra planning. If your usual route involves the White Oak or Brays Bayou trails, find an alternative. For downtown/Midtown runners, check local street closures for the Holi Festival. And if you're near NRG, the Rodeo BBQ Cook Off is gobbling up some roads. Embrace a new route or hit the treadmill.
