Alright, Houston, another day, another attempt to squeeze in a workout without inhaling questionable air or getting rerouted by endless construction. Today? It's a mixed bag, so don't just blindly hit the pavement.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That glorious clear sky and mild 20°C (68°F) sure *looks* inviting, and your allergies can breathe easy with low pollen.
*   But hold your horses, that AQI creeping into the moderate zone at 69, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) leading the charge, means your lungs are still doing some extra work.
*   Don't even get me started on the perpetual state of trail closures and construction chaos, which means planning is mandatory unless you enjoy dodging traffic on busy streets.

## The Lowdown: Run Smart or Stay Home

Look, the weather's playing nice for a change – clear skies and a comfortable 20 degrees Celsius. Perfect, right? Not so fast, sunshine. While your seasonal allergies probably won't be flaring up today, that Air Quality Index reading of 69, with "inhalable particulate matter" as the main culprit, is a bit of a buzzkill. This city's notorious for its industrial emissions, and even when it's not a full-blown "bad air day," those particulates can still mess with your respiratory system, especially if you're pushing hard.

And speaking of things that never change, our beloved Houston trails are, as usual, a minefield of detours and closures. The **MKT Trail Hogan Pedestrian Bridge**? Yeah, remember when they said that rehab would be done by last December? Apparently, those repairs are "delayed again," pushing back progress and leaving a vital link between the Heights, First Ward, and downtown in limbo. So if your route relies on that bridge, you're still stuck with those "unsafe" detours on narrow, car-heavy roads. It's not just the MKT, either; large sections of the Brays Bayou Trail remain shut down due to the never-ending SH 35 expansion. Don't even get me started on the White Oak Bayou Greenway near the Castillo Community Center, which is apparently closed until 2028 for IH-45/I-10 connector ramp work. Twenty-twenty-eight! Seriously, sometimes it feels like they just close trails for fun around here.

### AQI is Moderate - Mind Your Lungs
With an AQI of 69 and PM10 as the dominant pollutant, your lungs are on a moderate alert today. While not "unhealthy" for everyone, sensitive groups – that's you, asthmatics, and anyone prone to respiratory issues – might feel it. And hey, there was a brush fire in northeast Houston earlier this week that was pumping out smoke, so some of that particulate matter might still be lingering. Dial back the intensity if you feel any shortness of breath or irritation.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail Closures are STILL a Problem
The ongoing, perpetual closures are a real hazard. The MKT Trail Hogan Pedestrian Bridge is *still* out, forcing you onto sketchier street detours. And forget about a smooth ride on Brays Bayou Trail at Spur 5 or parts of the White Oak Bayou Greenway. Plan your route *before* you lace up, or you'll find yourself doing unplanned hill repeats over a construction barrier.

### Watch Out for Rodeo Season Mayhem
It's Rodeo season, folks. While the World's Championship Bar-B-Que Contest at NRG Park doesn't directly close trails, it means the entire area is going to be a congested mess from today through Saturday. If you're anywhere near NRG, expect heavy traffic and a general increase in vehicular and pedestrian chaos. Tomorrow, the Rodeo Trail Rides converge on Memorial Park. If you're a Memorial Park regular, be prepared for some disruption and extra crowds.

Houston Pollen Breakdown:

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Today's a decent day if you stick to a well-known, clear route and don't push the pace too hard with that moderate AQI. But for the love of all that is holy, check your specific trail before you head out, because if it's not closed for a highway expansion, it's probably getting a sign bridge removed or something equally ridiculous.
