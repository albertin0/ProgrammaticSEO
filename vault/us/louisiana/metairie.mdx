Another glorious Metairie morning, but don't just blindly lace up and hit the streets. Today requires a bit of tactical planning if you want to avoid turning your workout into a construction dodge-ball game or a lung irritant fest.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **AQI is flirting with trouble:** While "Moderate" sounds fine, an AQI of 80 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant means sensitive folks might feel it. Don't go for any PRs today.
*   **Construction is everywhere:** Seriously, try running almost any major thoroughfare, and you'll hit a cone. Multiple lane closures are active across Metairie.
*   **Weather's a dream, but don't get complacent:** Clear skies and 15.4°C (about 60°F) are ideal, but the other factors drag the score down.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe (or Try To)

Alright, let's talk about the air. Our local monitors are showing an AQI of 80, with Ozone taking center stage. Now, that's technically "Moderate," but it's on the high end of that scale, and some sources are calling it "Poor" for sensitive groups.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Ozone Alert for Sensitive Lungs
An AQI of 80, dominated by Ozone, means if you've got asthma, emphysema, or just generally cranky lungs, today's not the day for an all-out sprint. Reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. Those short, sharp breaths during a hard effort will pull more of that ozone deep into your system, and trust me, your respiratory system won't thank you later. Keep an eye out for throat irritation or difficulty breathing.

## Pollen Report

Good news on the sniffle front.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

"Low" pollen means your allergies probably won't be sabotaging your stride today. Enjoy it while it lasts, because we all know how quickly that can change around here.

## Weather Check

The actual weather? Near perfection. We're looking at a clear day with the mercury hanging around a comfortable 15.4°C. Perfect running temperatures, really. No insane humidity, no rain trying to drown you. Just make sure to stay hydrated, even when it's not scorching.

## Local Hazards & Roadblocks

This is where your run might get interesting, and not in a good way. If your usual route takes you anywhere near these spots, be ready for detours, increased traffic, and general irritation.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Construction Chaos
Multiple lane closures are active today, impacting key Metairie arteries.
*   **Citrus Boulevard at River Oaks Road:** The right eastbound lane is closed for street restoration through March 1st.
*   **Ames Boulevard between Trinity Drive and Avery Drive:** Expect continuous single-lane closures in both northbound and southbound directions until March 23rd for canal rehabilitation.
*   **Destrehan Avenue at Eastview Drive:** The right northbound lane is closed Monday through Friday until May 30th for a sewer lift station project.

These aren't just minor inconveniences; they can force you into traffic or onto rougher patches.
</AlertBox>

If you were planning on hitting the two-mile jogging path at **Lafreniere Park**, you're likely in the clear from these specific closures. That's probably your best bet for an uninterrupted run today. Otherwise, assume any major road could be a minefield of cones and frustrated drivers.

<AlertBox type="info">
### PT Tip: Pre-Run Recon
Before you head out, especially on a day with this much active construction, take two minutes to check local traffic apps. Your knees and ankles will thank you for avoiding uneven surfaces and sudden stops. And if you're hitting the pavements, bright colors are your friend. Drivers are already distracted by lane shifts; don't give them another excuse to not see you.
