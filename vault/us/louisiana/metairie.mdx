Alright, Metairie, listen up. Today's a decent day to get outside and sweat, but don't just blindly follow your usual route, because traffic's a mess.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Clear skies and a mild 18.2°C (about 65°F) make for some comfortable miles, which is a godsend this time of year.
*   Pollen is practically nonexistent, so your sinuses can take a much-needed break from the usual Louisiana assault.
*   However, our air quality is just ticking over to "Moderate" thanks to that lovely ground-level ozone, so if you've got sensitive lungs, take it down a notch.
*   Jefferson Parish is *busy* with roadwork, and it's going to throw a wrench in your plans if you run or cycle on major thoroughfares.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

Sure, the air looks clear, but don't let it fool you entirely. We're hitting an AQI of 70, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. That's not terrible, but it's enough to notice if you're pushing serious mileage. Your lungs are working overtime, so a moderate ozone level means you might feel it more than usual. Definitely not a day for max-effort sprints if you're prone to respiratory irritation.

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Tree        | Low     |
| Grass       | Low     |
| Weed        | Low     |

### Workout Hazards: Construction Chaos

Look, it's always something with our roads, isn't it? If you're planning a long run through the heart of Metairie or trying to get to a favorite spot like Lafreniere Park, prepare for detours and potential frustration.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Road closures and lane reductions are widespread across Jefferson Parish.** Specifically, the right eastbound lane of **Citrus Boulevard at River Oaks Road** is shut down until Sunday, March 1st. And don't even think about smooth sailing on **Ames Boulevard between Trinity Drive and Avery Drive**; single lanes are closed in both directions until March 23rd. Plus, if you're trying to navigate **West Esplanade Avenue at Page Drive**, expect intermittent closures on both eastbound and westbound left lanes today, February 26th, and tomorrow, February 27th, for gas main work. This isn't just an inconvenience for drivers; it means more traffic in fewer lanes, potentially less shoulder space, and overall a more hazardous environment for runners and cyclists trying to share the road.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
With all these road closures, now might be a good day to stick to dedicated paths if you can. If you must run on the roads, wear bright colors, be extra vigilant for distracted drivers, and assume they don't see you. Map your route *before* you leave. Seriously, don't rely on your old faithful path without checking for construction updates.
</AlertBox>

Overall, the weather's cooperating, which is a big win. Just don't let the pleasant temperature make you complacent about the air quality or the obstacle course our road crews have laid out for you. Stay smart, Metairie.
