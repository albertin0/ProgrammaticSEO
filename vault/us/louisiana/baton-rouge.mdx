Today's a pretty decent day to get out there, but keep that ozone on your radar.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is hovering in the moderate zone with ozone as the main culprit. It's not awful, but anyone with lung sensitivity should pay attention, especially later in the day when ground-level ozone tends to peak.</li>
  <li>Pollen is blessedly low. Your sinuses can breathe a sigh of relief, unlike those days when Baton Rouge looks like it's snowing oak dust.</li>
  <li>Temperatures are fantastic for a run, sitting around 14°C (58°F) under clear skies. You won't be melting, and you won't be freezing your fingers off.</li>
</BulletList>

## The Rundown: Don't Breathe Too Deeply (Yet)

Alright, Baton Rouge, let's talk about that air. The AQI is sitting at 75, which puts us squarely in the "Moderate" category. The dominant pollutant? Ozone. Now, for most of us, 75 isn't a showstopper, especially if you're just out for a casual jog along the LSU Lakes. But if you're pushing hard, really sucking wind, or you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity (asthma, bronchitis, or just a general aversion to coughing up a lung), you need to be aware. Ground-level ozone is formed when pollutants react in sunlight, and it's not great for your lungs. It can irritate your airways, cause shortness of breath, and generally make you feel like you're running through a low-grade fog, even on a clear day.

What does this mean for your workout? If you're planning a long, intense session, especially in the afternoon, consider dialing it back slightly or opting for an indoor workout if your lungs are feeling it. This isn't a "stay inside" alert, but it's definitely a "listen to your body" warning.

### What Else is Kicking Around?

I dug through the usual local news channels looking for anything trying to trip you up on the trails, and honestly, it's pretty quiet. No major smoke plumes from some distant bayou wildfire, no freak windstorms trying to turn you into a human kite, and thankfully, no flooding trying to turn Highland Road into a river. The Mississippi River Levee Path is clear, as far as I can tell, though you should always watch for cyclists who think they're in the Tour de France.

Construction is always a wildcard in this city, but there haven't been any recent reports of unexpected closures or hazards impacting popular running spots like the Capital Area Pathways or the trails around the Burden Museum & Gardens. That's a win, given how often a rogue orange cone seems to sprout up overnight.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  Even though the AQI is "moderate," if you're hitting the pavement for a long run or a high-intensity session, keep an eye on how your lungs feel. Ozone can be a sneaky irritant. Consider shifting your run to earlier in the morning or later in the evening when ozone levels might be lower, especially if you're doing hard intervals.

<AlertBox type="info">
  With clear skies and comfortable temperatures, remember to hydrate! Just because it's not scorching doesn't mean you can skip the water. And if you're running near the LSU Lakes, watch out for those geese. They own the place.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level |
|-------------|-------|
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Weed        | Low   |

Look at that beautiful "Low" across the board. Enjoy it while it lasts, because we all know what's coming. For now, your allergies can largely chill out. This is a rare gift in Baton Rouge, so take advantage before the oak pollen decides to declare war on your sinuses again.

In short, it's a good day for a workout, especially if you're mindful of that moderate ozone. Get out there, enjoy the clear skies and cool air, but don't push your lungs past their comfort zone.
