Today? If you're okay dodging traffic cones and breathing a little ozone, then sure, go for it.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality in Baton Rouge is hitting a "Moderate" 70 AQI, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Not ideal for pushing hard.</li>
  <li>Widespread road striping and ongoing construction projects mean you'll be navigating lane closures and potential detours on many major routes.</li>
  <li>Temperatures are fantastic, and pollen is low, so at least your sinuses won't be staging a rebellion.</li>
</BulletList>

Look, I love hitting the trails around Baton Rouge as much as anyone, but let's be real about today. You've got clear skies and a lovely 18.2°C (that's 65°F for the Fahrenheit crowd). Pollen's practically nonexistent, which is a rare win for anyone who usually runs with a tissue box taped to their face. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's a completely smooth ride out there.

The air quality, specifically our old friend ozone, is sitting at a moderate 70 AQI. While it's not "unhealthy," it's certainly not doing your lungs any favors, especially if you're trying to set a PR. Baton Rouge consistently struggles with ozone pollution, so this isn't exactly groundbreaking news, but it's always worth a mental note before you go all-out.

Now, for the real buzzkill: the roads. DOTD has rolling lane closures happening all over creation from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM, running through Saturday, February 28th, for striping work. We're talking LA 964, LA 19, LA 67 (Plank Road), LA 64, LA 409, and LA 37 – basically a bingo card of routes you might use. Plus, you've got ongoing city-parish construction projects everywhere from Lorrie Burgess to Groom Road to the always-a-mess Old Hammond Highway and Highland Road.

Think about the Pecue Lane widening and I-10 interchange project, which is supposed to be wrapping up by mid-2026. They're still messing with that, building new bridges over Ward's Creek, and you can bet on alternating lane closures around there. Even the Old Mississippi River Bridge (US 190 EB & WB) has outside lane closures daily for inspections.

So, if you're planning a long run down the Mississippi River Levee Trail, you might be fine once you get there, but actually *getting* to a clear stretch could be an adventure. If you're a cyclist, please, for the love of your tires and your life, assume every driver hasn't seen you.

Here's the lowdown:

### Air Quality & Allergens

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- |
| Low          | 70  | Ozone              |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  The "Moderate" AQI with ozone as the dominant pollutant means sensitive individuals might experience respiratory symptoms. If you have asthma or other lung conditions, consider scaling back your intensity today.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  Seriously, watch out for traffic. Widespread lane closures for striping on state routes (LA 964, LA 19, Plank Road, LA 64, LA 409, LA 37) and ongoing construction on key city roads like Pecue Lane mean runners and cyclists need to be hyper-vigilant. Expect sudden merges, uneven surfaces, and distracted drivers.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  With the mild, clear weather and low pollen, it's a great day for *indoor* workouts, or if you insist on being outside, stick to areas known for minimal traffic interference, if such a mythical place exists in Baton Rouge right now.
