Look, the weather's holding up, so if you've been itching to run, today's your chance before things get damp again.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The sun's out and it's a pleasant 23.7°C (around 75°F) – perfect for not overheating or freezing your tail off.
*   Pollen count is finally low, so your sinuses might actually thank you for stepping outside.
*   AQI is pushing into moderate territory with fine particulate matter, meaning you'll be breathing in a bit more than just fresh air.
</BulletList>

Today's a classic Baton Rouge mixed bag. The low pollen and clear skies are screaming "get outside," and honestly, after that last cold snap, 75 degrees feels like a gift from the running gods. But don't let the pretty picture fool you entirely.

The air quality is sitting at an AQI of 75, with inhalable particulate matter being the dominant pollutant. That's "moderate," folks, not "good." It means there are enough tiny bits floating around that if you're sensitive, or if you're planning on pushing a super high intensity, your lungs might not be thrilled. Think about where those particulates come from: a lot of it's vehicle exhaust, but also all the damn construction dust kicked up around town.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Air: Moderate Particulate Matter Today
With an AQI of 75 and inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the main culprit, sensitive individuals (that's you, asthmatics, allergy sufferers, and anyone with existing respiratory issues) should consider adjusting their outdoor workout intensity or duration. If you feel any irritation in your throat or lungs, cut it short.

Speaking of construction, it’s still everywhere. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a cones and detour sign. There are long-term projects like the I-10 widening that continue to cause alternating lane closures, and the Pecue Lane interchange is still chugging along. More locally, there's a ton of striping work happening on routes like LA 67 (Plank Road) and LA 37 (Greenwell Springs Road) through Saturday, often between 8 AM and 3 PM. These aren't just traffic headaches; they directly impact your running and cycling routes. Dust from these sites absolutely contributes to that moderate AQI.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Construction Chaos Continues
Expect roadwork, lane closures, and general mayhem on several key Baton Rouge arteries, including rolling lane closures on **Plank Road** and many other state routes for striping until Saturday. Pay attention to your surroundings, don't assume drivers see you, and be ready to reroute or hit the trails if the asphalt jungle gets too aggressive.

While today is clear, the National Weather Service is calling for increasing rain chances from late Thursday afternoon through Friday as a cold front moves in. So, if you're planning an evening run, keep an eye on the radar, and definitely factor it into your plans for tomorrow. Get your clear skies miles in now.

### Rain's on the Horizon
Enjoy the clear weather while it lasts, as rain chances are expected to increase from late this afternoon through Friday. Make sure your gear is ready if you plan to hit the pavement later or tomorrow.
</AlertBox>

Overall, it's a decent day to get out and move, especially if you stick to some of the greener spaces away from the main road construction. Just listen to your body regarding that air quality, and stay hyper-aware of your surroundings.
