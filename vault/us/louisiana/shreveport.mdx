Don't let that clear sky fool you, Shreveport, today's a trap.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today isn't the day to push it (at least not later)

<BulletList>
*   **Severe Weather Incoming:** While it might look okay right now, meteorologists are calling for a marginal risk of severe storms for late Thursday afternoon into the evening, bringing potential wind gusts up to 60 mph and quarter-sized hail across the Shreveport-Bossier area. That's not just a bad hair day; that's "get-indoors-and-stay-there" weather.
*   **Air Quality is Meh for Many:** The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 68, with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. For those of you with asthma, COPD, or just general sensitive lungs, that's enough to cause difficulty breathing and throat irritation, especially with prolonged outdoor exertion. We've had a burn ban in Caddo Parish recently, and while active fires are contained, lingering hotspots and dry conditions can always kick things up.
*   **Construction Continues to Be a Pain:** If you were planning a nice long run or ride along Clyde Fant Parkway near the Jimmie Davis Bridge, expect delays and detours. Construction on the new four-lane bridge is still underway, with pile driving and girder hanging operations progressing. It's not just a nuisance for drivers; it often means reduced shoulder space, uneven surfaces, and a general headache for anyone trying to navigate on foot or bike.

</BulletList>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Danger: Severe Storms with Damaging Winds & Hail Expected Later Today!** This isn't a drill. If you absolutely MUST get your workout in, do it *now* and keep it short. Seriously, by late afternoon, those strong winds and hail could make being outside genuinely dangerous. Don't be that person caught miles from home when the sky decides to open up with ice.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Pollen is low, which is about the only good news your sinuses are getting today. Enjoy it while you can.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up: Watch for Road Closures and Debris.** With those predicted high winds later, expect potential downed limbs and isolated power outages. Even if you're out before the storms hit, construction around I-20 and other major arteries (like that ongoing LA 3132 project) means lane closures and traffic shifts are the norm. Stick to known, safe routes if you venture out.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip: Hydrate, Even If It's Not Scorching.** At 25°C (77°F), it's a warm late-February day, and it'll feel even warmer with the humidity. If you're out there, make sure you're taking in enough fluids, especially if you're trying to outrun any impending weather. Your joints (and kidneys) will thank you.
