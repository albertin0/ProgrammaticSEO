Alright, another Saturday. If you’re not already out there, you probably should be. It's not perfect, but it's as good as it gets sometimes.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Ozone's creeping up.** That "moderate" AQI isn't a badge of honor, folks. We're looking at Ozone as the main culprit, especially as the day warms up and those calm easterly winds keep everything stewing. If your lungs are finicky, or you're planning a long haul, consider an earlier start.
*   **Temps are a mixed bag.** The official reading says 15.8°C (around 60°F) right now, which is damn near perfect. But don't get comfortable; the forecast screams "70s and 80s" for the weekend. You'll go from "this is nice" to "sweat running into my eyes" pretty quick. Hydrate early, hydrate often.
*   **Construction is still the city's favorite pastime.** Seriously, is there ever *not* roadwork? From the French Quarter still being a chaotic mess of torn-up streets as festival season approaches to DOTD closing lanes on Airline Drive and monitoring US 90/Claiborne Ave, you're gonna encounter detours and questionable sidewalks. Keep your head on a swivel.
</BulletList>

Look, it's New Orleans. We deal with it. Today, the biggest concern isn't rain or ridiculous humidity (yet), it's managing that "moderate" air quality and the rising temperatures. The low pollen count is a win, though, so at least your sinuses might not stage a rebellion.

### Mind the Ozone, Especially Later On
That AQI of 76 with ozone as the dominant pollutant means sensitive groups should be cautious. "Moderate" is code for "it's fine for most, but don't push it if you're asthmatic or have other respiratory issues." As the sun climbs and temps head towards the 80s, that ozone development gets a boost. Think about dialing back the intensity or sticking to the shade if you're out mid-day. Early birds get the cleaner air, as usual.

If you're heading out to hit the paths around **City Park**, expect company. The Fit 2 Evolve Walking Club has a meetup scheduled there today, and the Nola Miles Club also has an event. It’s not a full-blown race, but it means more folks out enjoying the mild morning, so be courteous and share the paths. You know, like a civilized human being, not a tourist.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Stay Hydrated, Folks
With temps pushing higher than the current cool morning, you'll be sweating more than you think. Bring water, or plan your route around a water fountain you *know* works. Trust me, finding out a fountain's busted three miles in is a special kind of hell.

### Watch Your Step in the French Quarter
If you're one of those brave souls running through the Quarter for "scenic views," just know those streets are still a minefield of ongoing construction. Between torn-up pavement and distracted tourists, you're practically doing an obstacle course. Seriously, maybe stick to something with actual running surfaces for your speed work.
