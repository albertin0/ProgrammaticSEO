Alright, New Orleans, let's talk about hitting the streets today.

Today's pretty good for a run, but watch your lungs and where you step, folks.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Beautiful, clear weather with a comfortable 22.8°C (73°F) means you won't be sweating through your eyeballs, which is a rare gift this time of year.
*   Pollen is playing nice with a "Low" rating, so your sinuses might actually thank you.
*   However, the air quality is still a bit... spicy. You've got moderate inhalable particulate matter floating around.
*   A few key running spots and neighborhoods are dealing with some real headaches, so plan your route or you'll be swimming (or boiling water) instead of running.
</BulletList>

## The Air: Breathe It In (Carefully)

Don't let that clear sky fool you entirely. While the weather's a dream, the air itself is only *moderately* polluted today, clocking in at an AQI of 74. The main culprit? Inhalable particulate matter. For most of us, that's just a nuisance, but if you're rocking asthma, COPD, or generally have sensitive lungs, AccuWeather is calling our air quality "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups" right now. You might feel it more on those longer tempo runs or hill repeats. Take it easy, or maybe stick to an indoor track if you're susceptible.

Sweet relief, right? Your nose can chill out today. Low pollen means one less thing to blame for that mid-run cough.

## On the Ground: Obstacles and Advisories

### Water Woes Continue

Listen up, especially if you're in Marlyville-Fontainebleau, Broadmoor, Hoffman Triangle, or B.W. Cooper neighborhoods. The Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans (SWBNO) has issued a **precautionary boil water advisory** for parts of these areas as of today, February 26th. This is due to a 12-inch water main closure on S. Rocheblave Street and existing low pressures from another closure on S. Claiborne Avenue. What does this mean for your run? Don't fill your water bottle straight from the tap in these spots without boiling it first. And if you see any standing water from recent breaks, treat it with extreme caution. We just had a large advisory lifted on Monday after a main break on S. Claiborne, so this is an ongoing battle.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Boil Water Advisory in Effect!
If you're running through Marlyville-Fontainebleau, Broadmoor, Hoffman Triangle, or B.W. Cooper, be aware of the active boil water advisory. Drink bottled or boiled water, and be cautious of standing water.
</AlertBox>

### Trail & Park Closures

Planning to get lost in nature? Think again, at least for some spots. The trails at **Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve's Barataria Preserve** (that's the one out past Marrero) are mostly closed for repairs. Only the Twin Canals Trail is open, and honestly, locals on Reddit are saying it's probably not worth the drive from the city for just that. These repairs are apparently going to take a couple of years, so adjust your long-term plans.

Also, don't head to **Joe W. Brown Park** expecting an easy workout; a portion of the roadway is temporarily closed due to bridge repairs. Better to find an alternate spot for now.

### Jean Lafitte's Barataria Preserve Trails are Mostly Closed!
If you were planning to explore the boardwalks and swamp trails at Barataria Preserve, most are closed for extensive repairs that could last two years. Only the Twin Canals Trail is open.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Construction Alert: Joe W. Brown Park
Avoid Joe W. Brown Park for your outdoor workout today, as a portion of the roadway is temporarily closed for bridge repairs.
</AlertBox>

On the bright side, the **Florida Avenue Bridge** is open to vehicles and pedestrians today, even though it's closed to marine traffic for railroad tie replacement until 1:00 PM. So, if your route involves crossing that, you should be fine on foot.

Stay hydrated, watch for the inevitable random potholes (it's NOLA, after all), and listen to your body.
