Today's a classic New Orleans "looks good, but it'll probably annoy you" kind of day for an outdoor workout.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is hitting a moderate 70, with ozone taking the lead. Your lungs won't be thrilled, especially if you're pushing the pace.
*   Don't trust that "clear" forecast too much; local weather for today, February 26, suggests a 40% chance of light rain. Expect some drizzle and potentially slick spots, because, let's be real, our drainage system isn't exactly world-class.
*   Construction is still *everywhere*. Seriously, it's a permanent fixture. While the big boil water advisory from February 24 was finally lifted after that Uptown main break near Toledano Street, the endless roadwork continues.

</BulletList>

Forget your zen run around Louis Armstrong Park without a detour; they're still doing asphalt repaving and sidewalk repair in that area. And if you thought the French Quarter was safe, nope. Businesses on Decatur Street are still dealing with construction chaos. It's a constant puzzle to find a clear path in this city, and it looks like FEMA funding issues are only making it worse for many ongoing street repair projects.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Zone Chaos:** Be prepared for sudden lane closures, uneven surfaces, and potential detours on many common running routes. Areas near major arteries and historical districts like the French Quarter and around Louis Armstrong Park are particularly prone to ongoing work. Keep your head on a swivel and don't assume a route you ran yesterday will be open today.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Ozone Alert:** With ozone as the dominant pollutant at AQI 70, sensitive individuals might experience respiratory discomfort. Consider scaling back your intensity, especially if you're prone to breathing issues. And remember, staying hydrated is always key, even when it's not scorching hot.
</AlertBox>

Overall, the temperature is lovely, and pollen is low, which is a rare win. But the air quality, the chance of rain, and the ubiquitous construction make it a day where you might be better off sticking to an indoor gym or planning a shorter, more cautious route. Your knees and lungs (and sanity) will thank you.
