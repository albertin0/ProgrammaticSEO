Alright, New Orleans, here's the lowdown for February 25, 2026:

Today's a solid day to get your miles in, but don't expect perfectly clear skies for your lungs or smooth sailing everywhere you go.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Pleasant temperatures around 21.4°C (70°F) and low pollen levels make for generally comfortable outdoor conditions, especially for those usually battling allergies.
*   However, our air quality isn't pristine; we're sitting at a moderate AQI of 62, with ozone as the dominant pollutant.
*   Expect detours and traffic headaches if your route takes you through the French Quarter or near major roadways.

### Weather & Air Quality Rundown

You've got clear skies and a comfortable feel out there today, with the mercury hovering around 21.4°C (70°F) and feeling more like 24°C (76°F). Humidity is manageable, and the chance of rain is a mere 10%, so no need for the rain jacket yet. Good news for your sinuses, too: pollen levels are mercifully low.

Now, about that air. The overall AQI is kicking it at 62, which is "Moderate" on the scale, mainly thanks to ground-level ozone. This isn't terrible, but it's not ideal for prolonged, intense workouts, especially if you're sensitive. The good news is official forecasts for New Orleans on Wednesday (today) predict "Good" AQI levels for both Ozone (40) and PM2.5 (44), suggesting things might actually be a bit better than the reported 62. Still, if you're out there huffing and puffing, keep it in mind.

### Your Daily Dose of Urban Adventure (Hazards)

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Chaos Continues:** If you're planning a run or ride through the historic parts of town, prepare for some navigation challenges. French Quarter construction is still a thing, dragging into what should be our lovely festival season. This means potential sidewalk closures, uneven surfaces, and general pedestrian mayhem. Also, keep an eye out around US 90/Claiborne Ave. near Louisiana Ave., where DOTD is monitoring lane closures that popped up earlier this week. If your commute takes you over US 90 BUS, the Harvey Tunnel's westbound lanes are closed through March 31, which is going to funnel traffic elsewhere.

**Lafitte Greenway Gets Lively:** Heads up for evening runners and walkers on the Lafitte Greenway! The Nola Miles Club has a running/walking meetup scheduled from 6 PM to 8 PM tonight. While it's a great community event, expect more foot traffic than usual, especially near 411 N Carrollton Ave where they meet. Share the path, people.

**Stay Hydrated, Even on Cooler Days:** While the temps are pleasant, New Orleans humidity can still sneak up on you. Don't forget your water bottle, especially if you're out for anything longer than a quick sprint around the block.
