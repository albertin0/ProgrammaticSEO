Today's a decent day to get out there, but don't expect miracles from your lungs if you're sensitive.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  - Air quality isn't *terrible*, but that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) means anyone with asthma or other respiratory issues might feel it more than usual. Skip the tempo runs, folks.
  - Temperatures are cool and clear, perfect for layering up without overheating. No slipping on ice out there, which is a blessing after last week.
  - Keep an eye out for construction near the Art Museum steps; always some kind of project going on to dodge, even if nothing major was reported today.

## The Lowdown: AQI, Pollen & How Not to Die Trying

Look, you want to get your miles in on the Kelly Drive loop, I get it. Beautiful views of the Schuylkill, flat, fast. But even a "clear" day in Philly can trick you. The AQI is sitting at 63, which, fine, isn't red-alert awful, but it's not exactly mountain air either. The dominant pollutant? Fine particulate matter. That's the stuff that gets deep into your lungs and can cause trouble, especially if you're pushing hard.

If you're healthy and just cruising, you'll probably be fine. But if you've got even a hint of a cough, or you're already feeling congested, take it easy. Don't go setting any personal bests today. This isn't the day to find out how robust your bronchia truly are.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Good news on the pollen front – it's low. So, your sniffles are probably from that lingering crud going around, not from tree pollen trying to murder your sinuses just yet. Enjoy it while it lasts; spring's always waiting to unleash hell on our allergies.

## Local Intel & What to Watch For

No major events are blocking the Schuylkill River Trail or anything like that today, which is always a win. However, there's always some background noise. Keep an eye out if you're near Fairmount Park; sometimes there are smaller, localized projects or utility work that pop up without hitting the main news cycles. It's Philly, expect the unexpected, especially near those older sections of trail.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Pro Tip for the PM2.5:** If you're running along Kelly Drive or MLK Drive, consider running on the side further from the road when traffic is heavy. A little distance can help, even if it's not a magic bullet.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Construction Chaos (Minor):** While no major closures were reported, Philly is perpetually under construction. Stay aware of your surroundings, especially if you're running through city streets to get to the trails. Sidewalks can be uneven, and unexpected detours are the norm.
</AlertBox>

The temperature is sitting pretty at 7.8°C (around 46°F) and it's clear. That's ideal running weather. No excuses for not getting out there, just don't pretend you're an Olympian if your lungs are feeling a bit meh from the air quality. Layer up, enjoy the lack of ice, and for god's sake, watch where you're going.
