Alright, Pittsburgh, let's talk about hitting the pavement today. The weather looks decent enough on paper, but if you think that means it's smooth sailing, you clearly haven't tried running past the Point lately.

### Pittsburgh Workout Conditions: February 25, 2026

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

**Why today is/isn't the day:**

<BulletList>
*   **It's "Clear," but don't be fooled:** The skies are blue (for now), and 7.2°C feels downright balmy after the deep freeze we just crawled out of. But this temperature swing is a double-edged sword for our infrastructure.
*   **Pothole Season is in Full Swing:** If your ankles could talk, they'd be screaming about the absolute minefield our roads and trails have become. Public Works crews are trying their best to patch them up, but with the continuous freeze-thaw cycles, new craters are opening faster than you can say "Burgh." Roads like Route 65 and Bigelow Boulevard are particularly notorious right now. Expect uneven surfaces everywhere.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI of 73, with ozone as the dominant pollutant, isn't going to kill you, but it's certainly not doing your lungs any favors. If you're sensitive, you might notice it, especially during higher intensity efforts.
*   **Loose Rocks and Mudslides Aren't Just a Summer Thing:** Remember the rock slide on McArdle Roadway just last week that shut it down for hours? That's the freeze-thaw cycle in action, and it means hillsides all over the city are unstable. While McArdle's reopened, it's a stark reminder that if you're hitting any trails with steep embankments, keep your head on a swivel.

### Mind the Potholes (and Your Ankles)

Seriously, every step is an adventure right now. The recent thaw has exacerbated the pothole problem across the city. Your best bet is to stick to well-maintained, familiar routes if you're running or cycling. If you must venture onto less-traveled paths, slow your roll and keep an eye out. Twisted ankles and damaged bike rims are not the souvenirs you want from a workout.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Hillside Instability: A Real Threat

Just days ago, McArdle Roadway saw a rock slide that closed it down. This isn't an isolated incident; Pittsburgh's steep hillsides are prone to these events, especially with fluctuating temperatures. If your route takes you near any steep, exposed slopes, exercise extreme caution. A rockfall or small mudslide can happen with little to no warning. Consider alternative, flatter routes today, especially if you're on something like sections of the Great Allegheny Passage where rockfall has been a concern in the past.

### AQI for Sensitive Lungs

The moderate AQI with ozone as the dominant pollutant means sensitive individuals might experience some respiratory irritation. If you have asthma or other breathing issues, consider shortening your outdoor workout or taking it indoors today. It's not a red-alert situation, but why push it if you don't have to?
</AlertBox>

Today is one of those days where the visual appeal of a clear sky can make you forget the ground beneath your feet. Don't be that person face-down on a cracked sidewalk or dodging falling debris. Stay alert, adjust your expectations, and maybe consider an indoor session if you're feeling iffy.
