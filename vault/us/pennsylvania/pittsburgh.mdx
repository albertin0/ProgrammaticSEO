It's actually a pretty decent day to get out there, Pittsburgh, if you can shake off the last whispers of winter and tolerate a little atmospheric grit.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky is deceiving; our AQI is hanging out in the moderate zone at 65, thanks to inhalable particulate matter. So, if your lungs are finicky, maybe dial back the intensity on those longer runs.
*   Temperatures are hovering around 3.3°C (38°F), feeling a bit chillier with the breeze. While yesterday saw some heavy gusts, today's winds are easing up, but still noticeable enough to make you earn that mile marker.
*   Pollen count is blessedly low, so at least your nose won't be staging its own marathon.

### Pittsburgh's Outdoor Grind: Trail Updates & What to Watch

Alright, let's talk brass tacks for your Saturday sweat session. The weather is playing a slightly kinder hand today after a pretty brutal winter, which was even categorized as "extreme" earlier this month. We've seen record cold and snow in February, so this "clear" and mild (for February) day feels like a gift. Just remember, a cold snap and some gnarly freezing rain could be heading our way next week. Pittsburgh giveth, and Pittsburgh taketh away.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up, Lungs!** With an AQI of 65 and inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, folks with respiratory issues or unusual sensitivity might notice it. It's not *bad*, but it's not pristine river air either. Listen to your body and don't push it if you feel any tightness.
</AlertBox>

If your usual route takes you along the **North Shore section of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail**, listen up: there's a significant, ongoing detour. A stretch of the trail between West North Avenue and under the West End Bridge is closed down for the Esplanade Project's construction. This isn't a quick fix; they're expecting it to last until summer. Don't be that runner who ignores the signs and ends up staring at a fence. The official detour guides you onto North Point Drive, Beaver Avenue, and West North Avenue. Plan accordingly, or you'll be doing extra mileage on pavement.

<AlertBox type="info">
**West End Bridge Inspections Next Week:** While not affecting today, keep in mind that PennDOT is scheduling single-lane restrictions for bridge inspections on the West End Bridge starting Monday, March 2nd, through Wednesday. These will impact traffic on Route 65, Beaver Avenue, and North Point Drive between 9 AM and 3 PM. If your run involves crossing or running near the northern approach of that bridge, be mindful of increased vehicle traffic and potential construction-related detours for pedestrians during those times.
</AlertBox>

On the flip side, the **Panther Hollow Bridge** repairs are chugging along through August, but thankfully, a pedestrian path is being maintained, and the trails beneath aren't seeing any long-term closures. So, Schenley Park is still your oyster, just don't expect to drive over the bridge any time soon.

We dodged any major flooding recently, despite some ice jam concerns further upriver, and there aren't any massive events blocking our usual running paths today. Just some routine construction projects around Hazelwood Green and the new Arts Landing space Downtown that aren't impacting your trail access.

So, layer up, grab your water (it's cold, but hydration is still a thing), and respect the air quality. It's a decent window before things get sketchier next week.
