Don't let the clear skies fool you, Pittsburgh. Today is one of those days where the city is actively trying to trip you up, between the air you breathe and the ground you run on.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is officially "Moderate," with more inhalable particulate matter floating around than your lungs prefer.
*   Multiple sections of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail are either closed or narrowed due to erosion and ongoing construction projects, meaning detours are your new reality.
*   While the temperature is a chilly 4°C, it's clear, so at least you won't be slogging through rain or snow.

## The Air You Breathe: More Than Just Chilly

Today's air quality is sitting at an AQI of 72, which the folks who track these things call "Moderate." The kicker? The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, specifically PM10. Think of it as microscopic grit floating around, ready to annoy your respiratory system. AccuWeather even warns that for sensitive groups, the air is reaching "poor" levels, advising reduced time outside if you're feeling symptoms. So, if you're prone to a cough after a run or have any lung issues, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to indoors today. It's not the wildfire smoke we've dealt with before, but it's not exactly mountain-fresh either.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI is Moderate with PM10 as the dominant pollutant.** Sensitive individuals, consider shorter workouts or moving indoors. Your lungs will thank you.

## Trail Closures: Pittsburgh's Perpetual Obstacle Course

If you're planning a scenic run along the Three Rivers Heritage Trail today, prepare for some creative navigation. The city's got more detours than a lost tourist with a broken GPS.

First up, the section of the **Three Rivers Heritage Trail along River Ave, particularly around the Herr's Island Bridge**, is narrowed to just five feet due to ALCOSAN construction. This started on February 20th and is expected to last two weeks, so you're squarely in the middle of that inconvenience. You can still pass, but keep your head up and share the space.

Further west on the North Side, there's a substantial, ongoing closure of the **Three Rivers Heritage Trail between W. North Ave and extending past Kroll Dr. to under the West End Bridge in Chateau**. This section is completely shut down until summer 2026 for the Esplanade Project. Don't just show up expecting to cruise; you'll need to follow the posted on-road detours. And don't forget the segment in the **Chateau neighborhood between Branchport Street and N Franklin Street**, which is also temporarily closed for repairs. The Friends of the Riverfront have been keeping us updated, so check their alerts if you're heading that way.

If you're looking to hit the Great Allegheny Passage (GAP), be aware that south of the city, near the **Layton Bridge (GAP Mile 99)**, there are ongoing construction vehicles and contractors you'll need to watch for. There's also a persistent warning about **potential rockfall between Duquesne and Homestead (GAP Mile 137)**, so stay alert, especially after any freeze-thaw cycles we've had.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Major Trail Closures and Hazards on the Three Rivers Heritage Trail!** Sections near Herr's Island Bridge, in Chateau, and under the West End Bridge are impacted. Expect detours and narrower paths. Check local alerts before you go.

## What's in the Air Today?

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant                  | Temperature | Condition |
| :----------- | :---- | :---------------------------------- | :---------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 72    | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) | 4°C         | Clear     |

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress in layers for 4°C!** It's cold enough to make those first miles sting, but you'll warm up quickly. A good wicking base layer, an insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell are your best friends. Gloves and a hat are non-negotiable.
