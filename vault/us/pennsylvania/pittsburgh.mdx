Alright, Pittsburgh, time to lace up... carefully. Today isn't the worst day to get out there, but you gotta pick your route smarter than a Steelers draft pick.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh, Not Horrible:** AQI is clocking in at 75 due to those pesky particulates. If you've got sensitive lungs, maybe dial back the intensity, but for most of us, it's just a mild annoyance.
*   **Pollen's Taking a Siesta:** Good news for the sniffle squad, pollen levels are low. Go ahead and breathe easy on that front.
*   **Chilly But Clear:** Temps are around 4.6°C (about 40°F) and it's clear out there. Nothing a good base layer and a windbreaker can't handle, but don't forget your gloves, ya jagoff.
*   **Watch for Falling Rocks and Construction Chaos:** This is the real kicker. Our beloved hillsides are still playing games, and there's some serious work happening that'll mess with your usual routes.

## The Daily Rundown

### Air & Allergies

| Pollutant          | Level        |
| :----------------- | :----------- |
| Tree Pollen        | Low          |
| Grass Pollen       | Low          |
| Weed Pollen        | Low          |
| **Overall Pollen** | **Low**      |
| **AQI**            | **75 (Moderate)** |
| **Dominant Pollutant** | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) |

<AlertBox type="info">
With an AQI of 75 driven by particulate matter, individuals with respiratory conditions might notice it. Consider taking it easy or opting for indoor workouts if you're particularly sensitive. For everyone else, it’s mostly business as usual.

### Weather Woes & What to Watch For

It's clear and chilly, which sounds refreshing until you remember Pittsburgh's unique brand of outdoor hazards. The ground has been through some serious freeze-thaw cycles lately, and that's not good news for our steep terrain.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Hillside Instability is REAL.** Remember last week when McArdle Roadway had that rock slide? That wasn't a fluke. The constant freezing and thawing makes those hillsides unstable. If you're running or biking on trails or roads carved into hillsides—especially anywhere around Mount Washington, or sections of the Great Allegheny Passage (GAP) between Duquesne and Homestead where rockfall has been reported—keep your head up and stay alert. There could be more falling debris.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Mon-Fayette Expressway Construction Will Disrupt Your Dravosburg Run.** If your route takes you anywhere near Pittsburgh-McKeesport Road in Dravosburg or West Mifflin, be warned: significant construction for the Mon-Fayette Expressway means road reductions and *severely limited pedestrian access*. Seriously, don't try to navigate through that mess. Find an alternative route that isn't a construction zone. It's not worth the hassle or the risk of getting creamed by heavy machinery.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Heads Up on the Three Rivers Heritage Trail Downtown:** Today is "Trail Care Thursday" on the section of the Great Allegheny Passage that uses the Three Rivers Heritage Trail downtown. Volunteers will be out there. Expect some activity, but it's not a full closure.
</AlertBox>

In short, it’s a decent day if you dress right and stick to known safe spots. Just be acutely aware of your surroundings, especially on any path that hugs a hillside or goes near active construction. This isn't the day to try new, untested routes, particularly if they involve sketchy inclines.
