Alright, Pittsburgh, if you're looking to pound some pavement or hit the trails today, you're going to want to bundle up and keep your eyes peeled for construction.

<BulletList>
*   **It's Cold, Dummy:** We're hovering right around freezing. While the sun might make an appearance later, those single-digit Celsius temps will bite if you're not properly layered. Your joints are going to feel it, especially if you skip that dynamic warm-up.
*   **Moderate Air, With a Catch:** The overall AQI is sitting at 74, which is in the "moderate" zone, mostly due to ozone. For most of us, that's fine, but if you've got asthma or are just generally sensitive, you might feel a little sluggish. Don't push your hardest intervals today.
*   **Trail Narrowing:** Heads up for anyone on the Three Rivers Heritage Trail. There's an ongoing construction project near the Herr's Island Bridge on River Ave that's narrowed the path to a mere five feet. It's been active since February 20th and will last another week. Share the path, folks, or find an alternate route.

## Today's Vitals

### Temperature Check
It’s 0.1°C out there, Pittsburgh, which is just above freezing. Clear skies mean no extra precipitation, which is nice, but it also means those morning lows are still dipping into the 20s Fahrenheit. Don't let the "clear" fool you into thinking it's warm; it's proper winter running weather. Expect it to *feel* like below freezing, especially with any residual breeze.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Cold Exposure Risk:** Dress in layers, cover exposed skin, and wear gloves and a hat. Listen to your body – hypothermia is no joke, even when it's "just" around freezing. Your muscles will be tighter in the cold, so a thorough warm-up is non-negotiable to avoid pulls and strains.

### Air Quality Report

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- |
| Low          | 74  | Ozone              |

That AQI of 74 puts us in the moderate category. The good news? Pollen is low, so your seasonal allergies probably won't be flaring up. The Allegheny County forecast from yesterday mentioned breezy conditions helping with good PM2.5, but our primary concern today is ozone. If you're sensitive, you might notice it, but for most, it's not a reason to cancel your outdoor plans, just perhaps dial back the intensity.

## Local Trail Conditions & Hazards

Beyond the cold, if you're hitting the popular Three Rivers Heritage Trail, be aware. The section near the Herr's Island Bridge on River Avenue is currently narrowed to five feet due to ALCOSAN construction. That's tight for pedestrians and cyclists, so be extra cautious and yield when necessary. It's not a full closure, but it's an inconvenience and a potential pinch point for accidents.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Three Rivers Heritage Trail Hazard!** Construction near Herr's Island Bridge means the trail is significantly narrowed (5 feet wide). This is a real pinch point for safety. Proceed with extreme caution or plan an alternate route.
</AlertBox>

On other major routes, keep an eye out for ongoing winter-related issues. The Great Allegheny Passage still has warnings for potential rockfall between Duquesne and Homestead, and erosion near Mile Marker 56. While no major *new* closures for *today* have been announced since the Nine Mile Run Trail reopened on February 6th, general trail surfaces might still be slick from any melting ice or minor snow, so watch your footing.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip:** If you're out on the trails today, consider wearing shoes with good traction, especially on shaded sections where ice might linger. And for the love of all that is holy, bring water. Cold weather running can be just as dehydrating as warm weather.
