Alright, Indy, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the dirt today. Forget what the calendar says about spring, this is still Indiana in February, and the trails always have a surprise.

Today's a "tread carefully, literally" kind of day.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **AQI's a bit spicy:** The air quality is sitting at a "Moderate" 69 AQI, with ozone being the main culprit. Your lungs won't scream, but they definitely won't be thanking you for pushing it too hard, especially if you're sensitive.
*   **Recent Storm Fallout:** While it's clear out now, we had severe storms yesterday and strong winds just a few days ago. That means potential for downed branches, debris, and slick spots hiding on your favorite routes. Don't be that person who twists an ankle because they weren't looking.
*   **Construction Never Sleeps:** Various ongoing projects mean detours and closures are a constant. You might find yourself rerouted unexpectedly, adding mileage or sending you onto less-than-ideal surfaces.
</BulletList>

## Trail Talk: White River Greenway

Let's cut right to it: if you're planning a long run or ride on the **White River Greenway**, particularly south of downtown, adjust your expectations. The Greenway (also known as the White River Trail or White River Wapahani Trail) is still closed between Kentucky Avenue and Washington Street, and has been since last fall. This closure is due to the Henry Street Bridge construction and is expected to last until *fall 2026*.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**White River Greenway Closure:** Expect significant detours. The official detour routes pedestrians and cyclists along Washington Street, the Indianapolis Cultural Trail, Capitol Avenue, South Street, Missouri Street, McCarty Street, and Kentucky Avenue. That's a lot of street running/riding, folks. If you were looking for a peaceful nature escape, this isn't it right now.
</AlertBox>

On a related note, the 30th Street bridge over the White River was *set* to open this month. I'd check Bike Indianapolis's website or local social groups for real-time updates before banking on that one. It could be open, or it could be "any day now." Don't get caught out.

## General Hazards & Tips

The weather today might be clear and a decent 8.5°C (that's about 47°F for those still stuck in Fahrenheit), which is pretty nice for running, but don't get complacent.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress in Layers:** With current temperatures, starting warm and shedding layers is key. A light base layer, a long-sleeve, and a vest or light jacket should do the trick. You'll thank me when you're not sweating through everything five miles in.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch for Debris:** Seriously, after those storms we just had, keep your eyes peeled. Potholes, gravel, and rogue tree limbs can turn a good stride into a bad day for your ankles. This goes for the Monon and Fall Creek trails too, not just the currently-closed sections of the White River.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Allergen | Level     |
| :------- | :-------- |
| General  | Low       |

Pollen-wise, you're pretty much in the clear. Low levels mean no excuses for your sniffles today.

So, go ahead and get out there if you want, but keep your head on a swivel. Indianapolis trails are a mixed bag right now.
