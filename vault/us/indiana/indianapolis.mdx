Alright, Indy, if you absolutely *must* get out there today, you'd better be ready to breathe some... *character* into your lungs.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is the Real Marathon Here:** Your lungs are going to be working overtime. With an AQI of 79 and fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) leading the charge, it's not exactly crisp, clean air. Forget "sensitive groups"; I wouldn't recommend anyone push their limits too hard with that going on. The American Lung Association already gave Greater Indy an F for particle pollution, so this isn't exactly a surprise.
*   **Washington Street is a Minefield of Cones:** If your route involves Washington Street west of downtown, good luck. IndyGo's Blue Line construction has parts of it, like between Belmont Avenue and Harding Street, shut down to through traffic for months, messing with pedestrian access until at least March. Expect detours, uneven surfaces, and the general joy of navigating a construction zone. Your ankles will love it.
*   **Temperature's Playing Nice, For Once:** At 7.2°C (around 45°F) and clear skies, the weather itself is actually pretty decent for a late February run. No ice to speak of, no crazy winds. Too bad you can't just run on weather alone.
</BulletList>

### The PT's Unsolicited Advice:

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Breathing, Seriously.** With the AQI nudging "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups," those of you with asthma, COPD, or even just regular ol' runner's cough should seriously reconsider that long tempo run. If you start feeling any chest tightness or unusual shortness of breath, cut it short. This isn't the day to try and PR your lung capacity. Fine particulate matter goes deep, people.
</AlertBox>

Look, I get it. We're all itching to shed the winter sluggishness. And while the temperature is cooperating, the air isn't exactly sending us love notes. If you're planning on hitting the Monon Trail, you're probably golden on the surface front, but that air follows you everywhere. If you absolutely need to get those miles in, maybe stick to a treadmill or an indoor track today, where the air isn't trying to actively shorten your lifespan.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Detour Awareness:** If you're usually around Washington Street, especially heading west, check IndyGo's Blue Line construction updates *before* you head out. Don't assume your usual path is open. There's nothing more frustrating than having to re-route mid-run because some project manager decided today was a good day to close another block. You'll likely be sent down Harding or I-70.
