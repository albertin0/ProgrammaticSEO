Today? You *could* hit the trails, but you might be sucking down more than just fresh air if you're not careful.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is sitting pretty at 79, which sounds "moderate" on paper, but AccuWeather is calling it "Poor" for sensitive folks due to fine particulate matter. So, your lungs might not be having the best day out there.
*   The weather is a solid win: 6.1°C (43°F) and clear skies means your joints won't freeze up, and you won't be battling any surprise downpours or ice patches.
*   Ongoing construction projects are still playing whack-a-mole with our beloved trails and streets. Expect detours, and for the love of all that is holy, pay attention to the signage.

## The Air: A Mixed Bag for Your Lungs

Alright, let's talk air. The good news is pollen is low, so sneeze-attack runners can breathe a sigh of relief. The bad news? Our Air Quality Index is creeping up to 79. While some scales might call that "moderate," AccuWeather is hitting us with a "Poor" rating for today, specifically warning that the air "has reached a high level of pollution and is unhealthy for sensitive groups." The dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter, the kind that digs deep into your lungs and can cause irritation or breathing difficulties if you're sensitive.

| Pollutant Type       | Level                       | Impact                                          |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Fine Particulate     | Elevated (AQI 79)           | Unhealthy for sensitive groups        |
| Pollen               | Low                         | Minimal                                         |

<AlertBox type="warning">
If you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally cranky lungs, consider reducing your time outside or opting for an indoor workout today. That fine particulate matter isn't messing around.

## Trail Closures & Construction Headaches

Indianapolis construction is a beast that never truly sleeps, and this week is no exception. If you're planning a route that takes you through downtown or near major arteries, you'll need to stay sharp.

The **30th Street bridge over the White River** is still listed as closed but "set to open in Feb 2026." Considering today is February 26th, don't assume it's open until you see it with your own eyes, or you might be adding an unplanned mile to your run. Always have a backup route.

Expect ongoing headaches along **Washington Street** with partial closures still in effect for the Blue Line construction. This isn't a 24-hour thing, it's a "for months" thing, so plan accordingly, especially if you cycle or run that way. Similarly, there are "until further notice" partial lane closures on **Senate Boulevard between 21st and 16th Street** for trail construction. This means navigating traffic alongside construction zones, which is never ideal for pedestrians or cyclists.

<AlertBox type="info">
If you're hitting the **Monon Trail**, specifically near the I-465 and US 31 interchange area, be aware that tonight (Thursday, Feb 26) from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., Meridian Street northbound and southbound from 96th to 103rd Street will see lane reductions. While this is primarily for drivers, if your evening run extends into those hours or you use adjacent roads, be cautious.

## Weather: The MVP Today

Finally, some good news! The weather is pretty much perfect for getting some miles in. At 6.1°C (43°F) and clear, you won't be battling strong winds, ice, or extreme temperatures. It's that sweet spot where you can comfortably layer up without feeling like an arctic explorer or a sauna regular. Enjoy it, because central Indiana weather can turn on a dime.

*Data grounded with AccuWeather and Clear Path 465 from February 26, 2026.*
