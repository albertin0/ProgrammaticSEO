## Today's a "Don't Be a Hero" Kind of Day.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

Today's not exactly a postcard-perfect running day, even if the skies are technically "clear." Don't let that bright sun fool you into thinking it's all rainbows and PRs out there.

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is hitting a solid **Moderate at 75 AQI**, with ozone being the main culprit. Your lungs might have opinions on that, especially if you're usually hacking up a lung after a long run.</li>
  <li>While the severe weather threat from yesterday has passed, temperatures are still hovering around a brisk **2.5°C (36°F)**. You might have seen some *light* snow early this morning, so keep an eye out for those sneaky slick spots, especially on less-trafficked paths.</li>
  <li>Indy's love affair with orange cones continues. Construction is everywhere, messing with our usual routes.</li>
</BulletList>

### Air Quality: It's Not "Good" But It's Not "Panic!"

Look, a 75 AQI with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't going to kill you, probably. But if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally enjoy breathing without a side of irritation, you might want to scale back that tempo run or keep it indoors. Ground-level ozone is notorious for irritating throats, causing headaches, and making your chest feel tight. Don't be surprised if your usual route along the White River State Park feels a bit… spicy today.

### Freeze Your Bits Off or Face the Ozone? Your Choice.

We're sitting at a cool 2.5°C, which is clear and sunny now, but remember those forecasts hinting at early morning light snow and slick spots? While most main roads should be clear by now, shaded corners or less-traveled parts of the Monon Trail could still be sneaky. A twisted ankle because you weren't paying attention? Not worth it. This isn't the day for minimalist shoes unless you're looking for an early physical therapy appointment (mine, ideally).

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Ozone Alert: Moderate AQI Means Mind Your Lungs.** Today's 75 AQI with ozone dominating means sensitive groups should consider indoor workouts. For the rest of us, take it easy and pay attention to how your lungs feel. Don't push through irritation.

### Construction Zone City: Detours and Headaches Galore

Indianapolis has decided to just permanently become a construction zone, apparently. If you're planning a run anywhere near **Washington Street**, especially between the White River Bridge and West Street, or further east from Southeastern to State avenues, prepare for chaos. The IndyGo Blue Line construction is in full swing, creating pedestrian impacts and detours. And if the **White River Greenway** is your go-to, remember it's still closed between Kentucky Avenue and Washington Street, a closure that's been ongoing since last September. The 30th Street bridge over the White River was slated to open this month, which is good news, but expect lingering work around any new infrastructure. Don't just blindly follow your usual path; you'll end up frustrated or, worse, in traffic.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Road & Trail Closures: Expect the Unexpected!** The White River Greenway is still closed near Kentucky and Washington, and Blue Line construction is a major headache on Washington Street. Plan alternative routes or risk getting rerouted into traffic.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Dress for the Chill, Don't Forget Layers:** While it's clear, 2.5°C is still cold, especially with any residual dampness. Layer up, cover your head and hands, and make sure your core stays warm. A proper warm-up is even more critical today to protect those cold joints.
