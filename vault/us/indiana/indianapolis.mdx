If you're heading out today, make it quick and stay hyper-aware, because Mother Nature is looking shifty.

<BulletList>
*   Temps are decent right now, but a "severe storms likely, tornadoes possible" warning isn't exactly ideal running weather.
*   Air quality is only "Moderate" thanks to ozone, which means some of you might feel it in your lungs.
*   We're staring down the barrel of widespread flooding and more winter weather hitting over the next few days, so plan for messy conditions this weekend and into next week.

## Today's Vibe: A Tricky Calm Before the Storm

Alright, Indy. Look, I get it. The sun's trying to peek through, the mercury's hitting a balmy 8°C (47°F), and your legs are itching to hit the pavement. But don't let this brief moment of clarity fool you. The National Weather Service isn't messing around; they've slapped us with a "Severe Storms Likely Today, with Tornadoes Possible" warning. That's not a suggestion to "power through," that's a signal to get your workout done, or indoors, *fast*, before things get ugly.

The air isn't doing us any favors either. While the pollen count is blissfully low, our Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 71, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. If you've got sensitive lungs, asthma, or you're just generally prone to feeling a bit huffy-puffy, you're probably going to notice it. Take it easy and listen to your body – it's not trying to win any awards today, just survive.

### Construction Chaos & Future Flood Fears

Speaking of things that never end, let's talk about construction. It's 2026, and our city is still a giant construction zone. Indy Parks alone has nearly 20% of its 218 parks slated for construction this year, and you can bet that means detours and uneven surfaces on your favorite routes. For instance, the ongoing expansion of the Cultural Trail out west across the White River is a long-term project expected to continue through late 2026, including a new Henry Street bridge. You might not see active closures right on the trail *today*, but always keep an eye out for unexpected changes. The Eagle Creek Trail also has extensions planned and construction ongoing through fall 2026. Assume your usual path has a surprise waiting for you.

But the real kicker? This pleasant calm is incredibly fleeting. Forecasts are screaming about heavy rains and rising flood risk for Indiana and the wider Midwest in the "coming days" and throughout March. We're talking potential for severe thunderstorms and even more snow (1-6 inches in Indy from Sunday to Monday, folks). Combine that with the "Spring Flood and Water Resources Outlook" issued just two days ago, and it means our waterways, trails, and roads could turn into a soggy mess very quickly. I also saw a warning about a "Rain/Snow Mix" causing "wet and possibly slick roads" this morning. Watch your footing.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Immediate Danger: Severe Storms & Tornado Risk!** The National Weather Service is indicating severe storms and possible tornadoes *today*. Do NOT ignore this. If you hear warnings, get inside immediately.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality:** With an AQI of 71 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, those with respiratory sensitivities should consider reducing prolonged or high-intensity outdoor activity.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up & Stay Nimble:** Despite the current clear skies, temps are still cool. Dress in layers, and be prepared for rapidly changing conditions and potential detours on any major trail, including sections of the Indianapolis Cultural Trail, due to ongoing construction.
