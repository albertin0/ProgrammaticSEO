It's a "meh, get it done" kind of day for an outdoor workout, but you'll need to plan around some serious reroutes.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
- The air quality is sitting at a "moderate" 68 AQI, driven by ozone. If you're sensitive or planning a tempo run, scale it back a notch or hit the treadmill. Your lungs will thank you.
- Good news for seasonal allergy sufferers: pollen levels are mercifully low. Breathe easy, buttercups.
- Multiple sections of our beloved trail system are still playing hard to get with ongoing construction and closures. Don't expect your usual route to be open smooth sailing.
</BulletList>

Alright, Fort Wayne, let's talk brass tacks about hitting the pavement or trails today, February 28, 2026. Weather-wise, we're looking at a clear sky and a crisp 6°C. That's fine for getting outside, especially if you layer up. Your joints won't be screaming from extreme cold, which is a win in my book after dealing with the deep freeze last week.

However, the air quality is another beast. With an AQI of 68 due to ozone, it's firmly in the "moderate" category. For most folks, a casual walk or an easy jog is probably okay. But if you're asthmatic, have other respiratory issues, or you're planning to push the pace, you might notice it. Consider dialing back the intensity or opting for an indoor session. There's no medal for pushing through a bad AQI, just potentially irritated airways.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Ozone
AQI 68 means elevated ozone. If you're hitting the Rivergreenway for some longer miles, be aware. It’s not terrible, but it's not "fresh mountain air" either. Listen to your body, especially if you're prone to respiratory grumbles.
</AlertBox>

Now for the real headache for us dedicated runners and cyclists: the trail situation. Our beautiful trail network is, shall we say, a work in progress in several spots.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail Blockages Ahead!
The **Rivergreenway's Saint Mary's Pathway** is still shut down between Clinton and Harrison Streets due to Riverfront Development Phase 2. This is an ongoing closure through *all of 2026*. Plan your downtown loops accordingly, because you'll be detouring. Also, the **Bluffton Road Bridge** area is undergoing reconstruction, meaning trail closures near Vesey Avenue and a mandatory detour to get to the Rivergreenway toward Foster Park. Don't just blindly follow Strava if it's outdated.
</AlertBox>

Beyond the major downtown and southwest detours, you've got other headaches. The **Hanna Street Trail** between Burns Boulevard and Decatur Road is still closed. Same goes for sections of the **Covington Road Trail** from Hadley to Getz Road. These aren't minor reroutes; they're full stops. You'll need to navigate city streets, which means more traffic, more stoplights, and less uninterrupted flow.

Construction on the **Illinois Road Trail** is listed as "active". While not explicitly a full closure, "active construction" usually means heavy equipment, temporary path changes, or sections that are simply not yet open for safe public use. Keep an eye out and be prepared for less-than-ideal conditions if you're in that area.

| Pollutant | Level   | Impact                                     |
| :-------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| Pollen    | Low     | Minimal impact for most.                   |
| Ozone     | Moderate| Potential irritation for sensitive groups. |

The low pollen count is probably the best news today. Enjoy that if you're usually suffering through spring sniffling.

<AlertBox type="info">
### New E-Device Rules
The Fort Wayne City Council just approved new ordinances for e-bikes and other micro-mobility devices earlier this week. This is less about immediate hazard and more about proper etiquette and rules for sharing our trails. Do yourself a favor and get familiar with the new regulations to avoid any unnecessary drama out there.
</AlertBox>

So, while it's a clear, low-pollen day, the moderate AQI and significant trail closures, especially around the Rivergreenway and Bluffton Road, mean you need to be smart and adaptable. Don't be that person surprised by a "Trail Closed" sign – check your route before you head out, and if in doubt, find a park with a known open loop or stick to your neighborhood streets.
