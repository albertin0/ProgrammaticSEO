Alright, Fort Wayne, if you're planning on getting outside today, you better tread carefully because while it looks clear, there are some sneaky hazards out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Icy Patches are Playing Hide-and-Seek:** Don't let the "clear" sky fool you. With temperatures hovering around freezing and dropping tonight, any melted slush or wet spots on bridges and shaded areas are going to refreeze faster than your motivation to run another mile.
*   **Ozone is Hanging Around:** That Air Quality Index of 76 means we're in "Moderate" territory, mostly thanks to ozone. If your lungs are sensitive, you'll definitely feel this one.
*   **Trail Detours Are Your New Normal:** Some stretches of our beloved Rivergreenway are still out of commission, thanks to ongoing development and bridge work. Don't just blindly follow your usual route.

### Today's Fort Wayne Rundown: Watch Your Step and Your Breath

It's February 26th, and while the sun might make a guest appearance, it's still very much winter out there, Fort Wayne. The temperature is a chilly 4°C (39°F), feeling a degree colder, which isn't awful for a run if you layer up, but it sets the stage for some real problems after dark.

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### BLACK ICE ALERT, ESPECIALLY TONIGHT!
Seriously, I've seen more wipeouts from refrozen meltwater than from slick leaves. Temperatures are dipping to 30°F tonight. Any puddles you see now will be solid ice on your evening or early morning routes. Bridges and shaded sidewalks are prime spots for this "flash-freeze." Don't be a hero; assume it's slippery and take it slow.

On the bright side, pollen is low, so your nose and eyes should be clear. But your lungs might still get a workout they didn't ask for. Our Air Quality Index is sitting at 76, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. This means sensitive groups, like those with asthma or even just runners pushing hard, might experience some respiratory irritation. It's not "stay indoors" bad, but it's not ideal.

For those of you hitting the trails, know that the Fort Wayne Parks and Recreation Department is on top of snow removal when we get more than three inches, but with intermittent melting and refreezing, they can't be everywhere. Expect potentially muddy and slippery conditions, especially on boardwalks near the water.

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Trail Closure & Detour Head-Up: Rivergreenway Edition
Heads up if your route involves the Rivergreenway near downtown or the Bluffton Road Bridge. The **St. Mary's Pathway between Clinton and Harrison Streets** is still closed for Riverfront Development through 2026. Also, if you’re planning on crossing the **Bluffton Road Bridge**, the trail is closed at Vesey Avenue, pushing you onto the sidewalks before you can get back to the Rivergreenway toward Foster Park. Don't be surprised; plan your detour now instead of getting frustrated mid-stride.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today is a day for vigilance. Bundle up, stay hydrated, and for the love of your knees, watch where you're putting your feet. Maybe stick to routes you know are well-cleared or have less direct sun exposure if you're out after sundown.

#### Pro Tip: Reflective Gear Isn't Just for Night
Even on clear days with low sun angles, especially near dawn or dusk, wear something reflective. Drivers are often less attentive, and with potential slick spots, visibility is your best friend.
