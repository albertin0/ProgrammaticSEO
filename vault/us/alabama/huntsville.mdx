Alright, Huntsville, it's a "could be worse" kind of day for getting those miles in, but don't ditch your run just yet.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" weather feels good, but regional wildfire smoke might be kicking up the particulate matter, so your lungs might notice it more than usual.
*   Pollen is moderate, which means your nose and eyes might decide to join the workout even if they weren't invited.
*   Urban roadwork means you'll need to keep your head on a swivel if you're hitting the streets.

### Why today is/isn't the day

It's clear out there, a crisp 7.4°C (about 45°F), which is pretty perfect for a run once you get warmed up. No rain to complain about, and thankfully, none of those icy conditions we battled a few weeks back are making a comeback. You might've heard about an Airport Weather Warning for Huntsville International Airport earlier this morning with some wind gusts, but that expired well before sunrise. So, no high wind advisories to literally blow you off your feet.

However, let's talk about what's actually floating around. The air quality in Huntsville is sitting at a moderate 79 AQI, with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) as the dominant pollutant. Now, while there are no *local* wildfires burning our green spaces, reports from central Alabama yesterday mentioned wildfire smoke impacting air quality from prescribed burns, and that stuff travels. If you've got asthma or any other respiratory issues, today might be the day to dial it back, or consider an indoor alternative. Officials specifically advised sensitive groups in areas affected by that smoke to stay inside.

Pollen is also at a moderate level, so if you're prone to seasonal allergies, pop an antihistamine before you head out, or you'll be sniffling through your entire route.

As for hitting the pavement, the City of Huntsville is always working on something. For instance, the westbound lanes of Pratt Avenue from Meridian Street were temporarily closed yesterday for road and railroad work. Also, the Martin Road bridge replacement project is an ongoing beast, using Trademark Drive as a detour, and that's expected to continue for another couple of years. If your usual route takes you near these areas, check for lingering impacts or detours. You don't want to get stuck playing Frogger with construction equipment when you're trying to hit a pace.

Out on the trails, like those at Monte Sano Nature Preserve, things are looking generally good from a weather standpoint. Just remember the Land Trust's golden rule: stay off wet trails for 24 hours after rainfall to prevent erosion and ruts. While we haven't had significant rain recently, it's always worth a quick check on conditions, especially if you're veering off the most popular paths. There's also a heads-up from a recent Reddit discussion about a section being converted into a greenway that could be rough on your trail shoes.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Air Quality & Pollen Alert:** For those with respiratory sensitivities or allergies, today's moderate AQI (due to PM10, possibly from regional smoke) and moderate pollen count mean extra caution. Listen to your body and consider shorter, less intense workouts, or move indoors.

**Urban Navigators, Beware:** Keep an eye out for ongoing road construction and potential detours on major arteries like Pratt Avenue and Martin Road. Your city commute might be your biggest workout hazard today.
