If you're looking for a clear, crisp run today, you might get half your wish before the skies open up and make things interesting.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI isn't *terrible*, but moderate ozone is never a runner's best friend. Take it easy on the lungs.
*   Temperatures are pretty sweet, but don't let that fool you: the rain is coming, and it's bringing slick surfaces with it.
*   Pollen count is low, so at least your nose won't be staging a rebellion today.

## Today's Huntsville Run Report: Don't Forget Your Rain Jacket (Seriously)

Alright, Huntsville, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the trails today, February 26, 2026. While the morning might start out looking deceptively pleasant with that 14.1°C temperature and "Clear" condition you might see on some apps, don't be a rookie. The forecast for Madison County today is swinging heavily towards rain, with a 70-90% chance of showers and even some thunder rumbling through later. That means those beautiful clear skies won't last, and what starts as a mild run could easily turn into a soggy slog on slick asphalt.

### Air Quality & Your Lungs

Your lungs are getting a moderate workout even before you lace up, thanks to an AQI of 68. The dominant pollutant is ozone, which for us runners means deeper breaths are pulling in more of that lung irritant. It’s not a full-blown "stay inside" alert, but if you're prone to respiratory issues, keep your pace conversational. Pushing a tempo run when ozone is up isn't doing your airways any favors.

### Pollen Report

Good news for the sniffle squad: pollen levels are low today. So at least you won't be battling a runny nose *and* the rain. Silver lining, I guess.

## Local Hazards & Trail Talk

That nice temperature is inviting, but the high chance of rain today means you need to adjust your expectations. Those early morning miles on the Aldridge Creek Greenway might feel fantastic, but later in the day, expect puddles, slick leaves, and general sogginess. If you're planning a longer outing, especially on any of the unpaved sections or singletrack trails up on Monte Sano, think about your footwear. Wet roots and muddy patches are no joke and a rolled ankle is a quick way to ruin your week.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Wet Conditions Ahead:** With a high chance of rain today, expect wet and potentially slick surfaces on all greenways and trails. Traction is your friend; consider shoes with better grip.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of trails, the city is actually working on expanding our greenway network, including a multiuse path along Bailey Cove Road and Phase II of the Miller Branch Greenway. While these are great for the future, active construction means you might run into detours or areas with increased construction traffic or equipment. Always stay alert and respect any posted signage.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Ozone Alert (Moderate):** An AQI of 68 with ozone as the dominant pollutant means your lungs will be working harder. If you feel any irritation or have asthma, consider an indoor workout or reduce your intensity.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration is Key, Even When It's Cool:** Just because it's not scorching doesn't mean you can skip the water. Even moderate temperatures and rain can lead to dehydration, especially with an elevated AQI. Stay topped off.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're heading out today, enjoy the mild air while it lasts, be ready for the wet stuff, and listen to your body, especially those lungs. And for Pete's sake, watch your step.
