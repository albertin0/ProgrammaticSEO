Look, if you're hitting the pavement in Huntsville today, you're not entirely off the hook, but it's not the worst day either.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That morning downpour and thunder? Yeah, hopefully you got your miles in *after* that mess cleared out. The current clear skies are a major improvement.
*   Pollen count is finally behaving itself, which is a rare treat for North Alabama, so your sinuses can relax for once.
*   Don't even *think* about doing your long run up Monte Sano via the Bankhead Trailhead. That whole area is still a construction zone for the Tollgate Greenway, and it's shut down until spring. Save yourself the frustration of a sudden detour.

## The Rundown: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

Alright, let's talk real. The air quality isn't exactly crisp mountain air right now. Your overall Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 75, with ozone being the main culprit. That might sound okay, but for anyone who actually *feels* that stuff in their lungs, it's a nagging cough waiting to happen. While some forecasts are even calling it "Poor" for sensitive groups today, the official word is moderate. Just be smart about it.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Alert: Ozone is in the Air!**
With an AQI of 75 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, those of us with sensitive respiratory systems might feel it. If you're prone to asthma or have other lung issues, consider scaling back the intensity of your outdoor workout, especially in the afternoon when ground-level ozone tends to peak. Don't push it.

### Trail Report: Monte Sano is a Minefield of Construction

If your usual go-to is the trails up on Monte Sano, listen up. The Land Trust of North Alabama has been hard at work on the Tollgate Greenway Project, which means the Bankhead Trailhead at Monte Sano Nature Preserve is *closed* for construction until Spring 2026. They're building a nice paved multi-use path, which will be great eventually, but right now, it's a no-go for your run. Find another route, or better yet, hit up some of the lower-lying greenways.

Speaking of greenways, Huntsville is constantly expanding. There's significant work happening on the Bailey Cove Multi-Use Path, which will eventually link into the Aldridge Creek Greenway, and another chunk of the Miller Branch Greenway is also in the works in west Huntsville. These are long-term projects, with some starting later in 2026, but always keep an eye out for potential local detours or temporary closures if you're running those areas.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Immediate Hazard: Monte Sano Trail Closure!**
The Tollgate Greenway Project construction has the Bankhead Trailhead at Monte Sano Nature Preserve *closed*. Do not plan on accessing trails from this point. Look for alternative entry points or different trails entirely. Ignoring these closures isn't just annoying; it's a safety risk.

## Weather & Pollen: The Good News

Today's temperature is a pleasant 17.7°C (about 64°F) and the skies are clear now, which is pretty prime for getting outside. Just remember that morning brought some showers and even thunder, so if you're hitting the trails, there might still be some damp spots, especially in shaded areas.

As for pollen, it's a beautiful, rare "Low." Your nose and eyes can thank the universe for this small mercy.

**Pro Tip: Hydration is Key, Even in Mild Temps**
Just because it's not scorching doesn't mean you can slack on hydration. A moderate AQI, even with comfortable temperatures, can still be taxing. Keep sipping that water throughout your run.
