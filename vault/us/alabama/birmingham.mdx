If you're an early bird, you probably already hit the pavement. For everyone else, today's a mixed bag, mostly thanks to that crap floating in the air.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Wildfire Smoke's a Killer (for your lungs, anyway):** That "clear" sky is deceptive. We've got fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) from wildfire smoke hanging around. The Jefferson County Department of Health explicitly warned sensitive groups (asthma, COPD, heart issues) to avoid outdoor activity. So, unless you enjoy feeling like you've smoked a pack after a mile, think twice.
*   **Morning Fog was a Hazard:** If you were out before 8 AM, you were probably navigating a dense fog advisory. Visibility was less than a quarter-mile in central Alabama, making those early runs on places like the Rotary Trail a bit of a gamble.
*   **Temps are Warming, But Don't Get Fooled:** While it started chilly (around 8.7°C / 47.7°F), the forecast expects highs in the lower to mid-70s Fahrenheit. Great for muscles, but that smoke ain't clearing out with the sun.

## Today's Pollen Breakdown (Don't Blame the Trees)

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

The good news is, your allergies probably won't be acting up today. Low pollen is a rare win, so savor it.

## The Air: A Not-So-Breathable Truth

Look, I'm not here to sugarcoat it. While the temperature is shaping up to be decent, and the skies might *look* clear, that AQI of 73 is squarely in the "Moderate" zone, and the dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter. This isn't just "meh" air; this is "wildfire smoke" air.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**DANGER: Wildfire Smoke & Your Lungs!**
The Jefferson County Department of Health issued a stark warning yesterday regarding increased PM2.5 concentrations from wildfire smoke. If you have asthma, COPD, or any cardiovascular issues, seriously consider moving your workout indoors. These microscopic particles can get deep into your lungs and even your bloodstream, causing more than just a cough.
</AlertBox>

Even if you're not in a "sensitive group," pushing hard in this kind of air means your lungs are working overtime to filter out crud they shouldn't have to. You're not building character, you're just irritating your respiratory system. Is that PR really worth it? Maybe dial it back, or hit the treadmill. Your body will thank you later.

## Roadblocks and Trail Annoyances

As of this morning, no major trail closures were reported for our beloved running spots like the Rotary Trail. However, general roadwork is always a thing in this city. If you're running on urban routes, stay vigilant. Construction on the Camp Hill line stations (Moseley, Kings Heath, Pineapple Road) might mean some localized activity, but nothing that should shut down your run unless you're literally sprinting through a construction site, which, let's be honest, some of you probably would.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up, Early Risers!**
The Dense Fog Advisory for central and eastern Alabama expired at 8 AM CST. If you were out before then, visibility was an issue. While it's lifting, always be mindful of lingering patches or moisture on surfaces.

## Hydration and Listen to Your Body

Clear skies and rising temps mean you'll need to stay hydrated. Don't wait until you're gasping for water to start chugging. And seriously, *listen to your body*. If your chest feels tight, your throat is scratchy, or you just feel generally crummy, call it a day. This isn't a badge of honor; it's a warning sign. Your long-term health is more important than hitting arbitrary mileage today.
