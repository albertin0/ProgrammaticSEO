Birmingham, get ready for a damp one if you’re planning to hit the pavement or trails today, and maybe think twice about those deep breaths.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   Expect light rain and showers throughout the day with a high chance of precipitation, making for slick surfaces and a generally soggy experience.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate level, primarily due to ozone, but keep in mind that smoke from recent prescribed burns is still lingering, adding some extra particulate matter to the mix.
*   Temps are mild, but the wet conditions mean you'll need to layer right to avoid getting chilled, especially on longer efforts.

Look, I love running the Shades Creek Greenway as much as the next masochist, but today might not be its shining moment. That trail, which was undergoing construction last year to link existing segments from Irondale to Mountain Brook, has had its share of flooding concerns. With a 65-90% chance of rain rolling through Birmingham today, you can bet some sections will be more like a creek than a greenway. Don't be that person trying to run through ankle-deep water, risking a twisted ankle or worse. Your joints will thank you for picking a different spot, or at least sticking to paved, well-drained areas.

## Air Quality Check: Don't Be a Human Air Filter

Our Air Quality Index is clocking in at 71, which is "Moderate." That means if you're particularly sensitive – maybe you’ve got asthma, COPD, or just a general aversion to feeling cruddy after a workout – today isn't the day to push your limits outside. The dominant pollutant is ozone, which is great for feeling like you've been breathing exhaust fumes, but we also have lingering PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) from some prescribed burns in the broader area.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone and Smoke Advisory:** If you're an older adult, have heart or lung conditions, or are a child, consider keeping your outdoor workout light and short, or moving it indoors. Moderate AQI with ozone and lingering smoke isn't ideal for sustained exertion.
</AlertBox>

## Weather Woes: Rain, Rain, Go Away... Or Just Don't Run Today

The weather folks are calling for light rain and showers all day, with a significant chance of thunderstorms later in the evening. Temperatures are hovering around 15.4°C (about 60°F), which usually feels pretty decent, but add constant drizzle and it quickly turns into a cold, clammy mess.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Buttercup:** If you insist on braving the elements, wear moisture-wicking layers. A good waterproof (or at least water-resistant) outer shell is your friend. And seriously, watch your footing on wet pavement and trails. You don't want to end up taking an unplanned dip in a puddle, or worse, visiting my physical therapy clinic for a slip-and-fall injury.

## Pollen Report: The One Good Thing

Alright, here's your silver lining: pollen levels are mercifully low. So, while your lungs might still feel a bit gnarly from the air quality, at least you probably won't be sneezing your way through your run.

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Low          | N/A           |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Avoid Untamed Trails:** Trails like the more rugged paths within Red Mountain Park might become treacherous mud pits. Stick to known paved routes if you absolutely must run outside in the rain, or better yet, hit the gym.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, sometimes the best workout is the one that doesn't put you in the emergency room.
