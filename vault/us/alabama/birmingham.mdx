If you're planning on an outdoor workout today, you might as well plan on getting soaked and dodging airborne debris, because Mother Nature is feeling feisty.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Severe Storm Risk:** Forget "clear skies." The National Weather Service is calling for a low risk of strong to severe storms from noon to 10 PM today, with threats of large hail and damaging winds. Pair that with an 80% chance of rain and thunderstorms, and you're looking at a bad time for anything outside.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI of 80 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't exactly fresh mountain air. Your lungs already have enough to deal with without sucking in storm-churned crud.
*   **Trail Disruption:** Construction on the Shades Creek Greenway is supposed to resume this week, "weather permitting." Given the forecast, "weather permitting" likely means "don't count on it," but if work *is* happening, expect potential mud and detours.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The temperature at a balmy 19.2°C (about 67°F) sounds inviting. But that's a trap, people. That's *exactly* the kind of weather front that cooks up nasty thunderstorms here in Birmingham. You might start your run feeling great, but by the time you're halfway through your loop around Red Mountain Park, you could be facing down hail the size of golf balls and wind gusts trying to steal your hat (or worse, your whole body).

<AlertBox type="danger">
**DANGER: Severe Weather Risk!** The primary threat today is strong to severe storms with large hail and damaging winds from noon to 10 PM. Do NOT risk being caught outside in these conditions. Seek immediate shelter if you hear thunder or see lightning. Your PR isn't worth getting zapped or clobbered by a falling tree branch.
</AlertBox>

Pollen is thankfully low today, so at least your sinuses might get a break. But your lungs? That moderate AQI, driven by Ozone, is still a low-grade irritant. Add in the humidity and potential for storm-related atmospheric weirdness, and it’s not exactly prime breathing conditions.

And speaking of local spots, if you were planning on cruising the Shades Creek Greenway, remember that construction is on again, off again. Even without the storms, expect potential disruptions from the work anticipated to resume this week. You don't want to round a corner only to find heavy machinery or a freshly churned mud pit where your smooth asphalt used to be. The I-59/20 bridge project downtown is still chugging along, so traffic around there will be its usual chaotic self, but that's less of a direct workout hazard and more of a "general Birmingham life" hazard.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**WARNING: Radar Outage!** Be aware that the DOD weather radar near Auburn/Montgomery is offline for maintenance today and tomorrow. While other radars are active, it means one less set of eyes on incoming weather, so pay extra attention to local alerts and the sky.
</AlertBox>

My advice? Find an indoor track, hit the treadmill, or check out one of the indoor facilities like the Birmingham CrossPlex (though they're hosting indoor track championships, so it might be busy). If you absolutely *must* get outside, keep it short, stay close to home, and for the love of all that is holy, watch the sky and listen for thunder. Don't be that person caught miles from shelter when the bottom falls out. Your knees will thank you for not running on waterlogged asphalt, and your brain will thank you for not becoming a lightning rod.

<AlertBox type="info">
**PT Tip:** If you do find yourself running in the rain, remember that wet surfaces can drastically change how your foot strikes and pushes off, increasing the load on your shins and knees. Shorten your stride, lighten your step, and consider skipping any technical trails until things dry out. And seriously, don't run in a thunderstorm.
