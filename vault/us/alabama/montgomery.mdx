Today? It's one of those Montgomery days where you *could* get out, but you need to keep your eyes peeled for more than just rogue squirrels.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Clear Skies & Mild Temps:** At a crisp 10.9°C (around 51°F) and completely clear, the weather itself is practically begging you to lace up. Your joints will thank you for skipping the humidity or the deep freeze.
*   **Pollen? What Pollen?:** Low pollen counts mean your lungs won't be staging a full-on rebellion today, which is a rare win for us runners in this city.
*   **AQI Blues & Construction Chaos:** While the weather's nice, our air quality is sitting at a "Moderate" 77, thanks to fine particulate matter. Add to that the ongoing construction around town, and you've got a recipe for some lung-irritating dust and unexpected detours.

## The Air You Breathe (or Don't)

Let's be real, an AQI of 77 isn't going to kill you, but it's not exactly sparkling mountain air either. The dominant pollutant being fine particulate matter means that every breath you take on your run is sucking in tiny particles that your lungs just don't need. If you've got sensitive airways, asthma, or just prefer to not feel like you've been chain-smoking, maybe ease up on the intensity or duration today. It's moderate, but "moderate" still implies "use caution," especially for prolonged efforts. The talk from earlier this year about rolling back air quality protections certainly doesn't help my general optimism about the long-term outlook here.

See? A silver lining! Your sinuses are getting a break. Enjoy it, because we all know it won't last forever.

## Navigating the Urban Maze (aka Montgomery's Construction Zones)

Here's where things get interesting. Montgomery is always building something, and right now, that "something" directly impacts our running routes.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Riverfront Greenway Trail Expansion
Good news, eventually: The Riverfront Greenway Trail is getting a $2.4 million expansion, which means more miles for us to chew up in the future. Bad news, today: That also means ongoing construction. Expect detours, uneven surfaces, and possibly heavy equipment near the trail, especially if your route takes you towards Shady Street Trailhead Park. Stay alert, watch your footing, and don't assume the path you took yesterday is clear today.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Downtown Detours
If your usual loop takes you downtown, be mindful of the continuous construction for the new Alabama State House and its parking deck. While it's largely an interior job by now, you can bet there's still activity that might impact sidewalks or crosswalks. Similarly, there's a new Legacy Site by Elevation opening this month which means more localized construction activity. Just assume any downtown area could be a bit of a maze.

It's a clear, cool day, which is a gift in itself. Just be smart about that air and don't let a misplaced orange cone take you out. Pay attention to your body, especially your lungs, and stay safe out there.
