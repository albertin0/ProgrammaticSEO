Look, if you're thinking of lacing up for an outdoor run in Montgomery today, you're either incredibly optimistic or completely delusional, because the weather forecast for heavy rain is a solid no-go.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

## Why today is decidedly *not* the day

<BulletList>
*   **Don't Let the Sun Fool You:** Your current "clear" condition is a fleeting illusion. The forecast for Thursday, February 26th, is a solid wall of "heavy rain during the day and rain at night." So, that pretty sunrise? It's just laughing at your impending soggy fate.
*   **Muddy Trails, Angry Ankles:** All that water means any natural surface trail in town is going to be a treacherous, slippery mess. Trying to navigate sections of the Riverfront Greenway Trail or the dirt paths in Blount Cultural Park will be less of a run and more of a slip-and-slide event. Your ankles and knees will thank you for staying inside.
*   **Ozone's Uninvited Guest Appearance:** While not an immediate showstopper, our Air Quality Index is sitting at 65 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. For most of you iron lungs, it's probably fine, but if you've got any respiratory sensitivities, you might feel a little extra burn.

### DANGER: Heavy Rain & Flooding Risk!
Let's cut to the chase: "Heavy rain" isn't a suggestion, it's a warning from the weather folks. We're talking about serious downpours today, which means rapidly rising water on streets and potential localized flooding. Trying to run through standing water is asking for trouble – from submerged debris to getting swept into a storm drain. Your personal record isn't worth an ER visit or a starring role on the local news for needing rescue. Stay off any street that looks like a new river.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### WARNING: Trails Will Be a Swampy Injury Trap
Seriously, forget those picturesque trail runs today. Any natural surface trail you consider, whether it's part of the Riverfront Greenway Trail network or something more secluded around Blount Cultural Park, is going to be a slick, muddy, ankle-twisting nightmare. When you're constantly fighting for traction, you're not just risking a spectacular face-plant; you're also putting excessive, unnatural strain on your ankles, knees, and hips trying to compensate. That's a direct route to a sprain, strain, or an overuse injury that will sideline you longer than the rain will. Give them a day (or two) to dry out.

### PSA: Ozone - Your Lungs' Unwanted Workout Partner
With an AQI of 65 and ozone leading the charge, your lungs are already working a little harder than usual. If you're generally sensitive to air quality, or if you've got any underlying respiratory conditions like asthma, pushing a hard effort outside today isn't doing your body any favors. Listen to those lungs; if they're complaining, it's a signal to take your workout indoors. Consider hitting up a place like HOTWORX in Peppertree Plaza for some infrared heat, or Orangetheory on Perry Hill Road.
