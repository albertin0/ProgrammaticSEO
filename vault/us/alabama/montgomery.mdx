Look, if you're hitting the pavement in Montgomery today, you're going to need to be smart about it, especially with that ozone creeping up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 71, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. That's not terrible, but it's enough to notice if you're pushing hard, particularly if your lungs aren't always 100%.
*   We've got some ongoing traffic pattern shifts, like the one at US-80 and Marler Road that just started yesterday. Watch your six if your route involves hitting the roads.
*   Later today, the forecast for the Southeast is looking at potential thunderstorms. This means wet, possibly slick surfaces, and a general unpleasantness that can derail an otherwise good outdoor session.
</BulletList>

Today's one of those days where "clear skies" doesn't quite tell the whole story. While the mercury is sitting at a comfortable 20.9°C (perfect for a run, honestly), and the pollen count is mercifully low, the air itself isn't exactly pristine. An AQI of 71, driven by ozone, is going to affect your respiratory system more than you might think when you're sucking wind on a tempo run. Your lungs are working harder to process that air, and that can reduce your overall performance and, more importantly, irritate your airways.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert: Mind Your Lungs**
With ozone as the dominant pollutant and the AQI at 71, those with asthma, respiratory sensitivities, or anyone planning a high-intensity workout should consider scaling back. If you feel any irritation, cut it short and head inside. This isn't the day to try and PR your 10K on the Riverfront Greenway Trail.
</AlertBox>

Beyond the air, remember those ever-present Montgomery roadworks. The Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) kicked off traffic pattern shifts at the US-80 and Marler Road intersection just yesterday, February 25. If your usual cycling or running route takes you through that area, expect changes and stay vigilant. Drivers around construction zones aren't always paying attention, and neither are runners who are zoned out on their music.

And speaking of roads, don't let the current "Clear" condition fool you. The national traffic forecast is predicting thunderstorms for the Southeast later today, specifically mentioning the I-65 and I-75 corridors which cut right through our neck of the woods. Even if it's not pouring when you head out, recent rain can leave trails muddy and roads slick. Be prepared for rapidly changing conditions.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Footwear & Visibility**
If you insist on an outdoor workout, consider trail shoes for better grip if you hit any natural surfaces, especially with potential rain. For road runners, assume the asphalt might be greasy. And always, *always* wear reflective gear, especially if you're out near those shifted traffic patterns on US-80.
</AlertBox>

In short: it's not a terrible day, but it's not a *great* day either. Exercise some caution, listen to your body, and maybe keep that run a little shorter and less intense than usual.
