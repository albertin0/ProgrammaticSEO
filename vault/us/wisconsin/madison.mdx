If you're heading out today, Madison, you better bundle up and watch your footing, because it's a cold one with a side of potential slickness.

## Why today isn't the day (or at least, why you need to be smart about it)

<BulletList>
*   **Frigid Air & Sneaky Snow:** While the sky *looks* clear right now, it's a chilly -0.7°C (30°F) with a "feels like" temperature of -7°C (20°F), and there's a 35% chance of snow showers throughout the day. Your lungs aren't going to love that shock of cold air, and your joints will be stiff before you even hit your stride. Plan on some serious layering and an indoor warm-up.
*   **Icy Surprises:** With temperatures hovering around freezing, any existing moisture from yesterday could turn into black ice, especially in shaded areas or on less-trafficked paths. A bit of snow could easily conceal these hazards. Think "ice cleats" or good trail shoes if you're venturing off well-salted pavement.
*   **Trail Detours & Closures:** If your route involves the Capital City State Trail down in Fitchburg, be aware that a section is closed until late March for boardwalk installation. A detour is provided, but it means unexpected changes to your usual run. Always check before you go.

### Stay Safe Out There, You Crazy Diamond

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Hypothermia & Frostbite Risk:** Seriously, it's cold. Public Health Madison & Dane County was warning about extreme cold just last month, and while today isn't *that* extreme, -7°C "feels like" is no joke. Protect exposed skin, wear a hat and gloves, and know the signs of frostbite and hypothermia. Don't push it.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Slippery When Wet... or Frozen:** That 35% chance of snow, combined with current temperatures, means you need to assume surfaces could be slick. Shorten your stride, slow your pace, and avoid sudden turns. A fall on ice means a potential sprain, fracture, or worse. This isn't the day to try to PR your pace around Lake Monona.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for Success (and Survival):** Layers, people, layers! Start with a moisture-wicking base, add insulation, and finish with a windproof outer shell. Your core will thank you. Don't forget wool socks and a neck buff you can pull up over your face to protect your airways from that cold, ozone-tinged air.
