Milwaukee, you want to run outside today? Fine, but don't come crying to me when your fingers are numb and you're rerouted into a construction zone.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

### Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Brutal Cold, Clear Skies:** It's sunny, but the temperature is hovering around a balmy -2.5°C (28°F), feeling more like -8°C to -9°C (15-18°F) thanks to the wind. Your lungs might freeze, but at least your allergies won't bother you.</li>
  <li>**Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is sitting at 68, which is "moderate," with ozone as the main culprit. If you're sensitive, you might feel it. Don't be a hero.</li>
  <li>**Construction Chaos Continues:** This city never sleeps, and neither does its construction. Major arteries and trails are still impacted, forcing detours.</li>
</BulletList>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ## Major Trail and Road Closures!
  Listen up, especially if your usual route involves the Menomonee Valley. The **Hank Aaron State Trail** has multiple closures you *need* to be aware of. The River Loop section is shut down through winter 2026 for the 16th Street bridge replacement. Furthermore, a chunk of the trail near 32nd Street and Canal Street is closed until June 2026 due to the ongoing I-94 project, with a detour shunting you onto Canal Street. And don't even *think* about cruising over the **27th Street Bridge**; that bad boy is closed for the long haul due to the WisDOT 94 East-West Freeway Project, starting this month. Plan your route meticulously, or you'll be adding an unplanned urban obstacle course to your workout.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ## Watch for Ice and Wind
  While yesterday brought some light snow, and today is clear, residual ice is still a sneaky menace on untreated surfaces. With temperatures still well below freezing and gusts up to 20 mph (faster near the lake), wind chill is a real factor. Your run along Lake Michigan is going to feel significantly colder than your weather app tells you. Protect your exposed skin.

<AlertBox type="info">
  ## Gear Up for the Cold
  Layers are your best friend. Think moisture-wicking base, insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and a neck gaiter or balaclava. Proper footwear with good traction is also a non-negotiable if you plan on straying from freshly plowed sidewalks. Stay hydrated, even if it doesn't feel like you're sweating.
</AlertBox>

Look, the sun is out, which is a win in February, but the cold is no joke, and the construction around the I-94 corridor and the Hank Aaron Trail is a persistent headache. If you're determined, dress smart, check your specific route for those construction detours, and be ready to adapt. Or, you know, hit the treadmill. Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor, or at least the better part of avoiding frostbite and an unexpected detour through industrial parks.
