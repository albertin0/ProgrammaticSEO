Alright, Milwaukee, let's talk about hitting the pavement today. If you're looking for an excuse to stay bundled up with a coffee, I'm about to hand you a few.

<BulletList>
  <li>The mercury is barely above freezing, feeling colder, with a decent chance of snow showers throughout the day. Your lungs are going to feel that bite.</li>
  <li>Pollen levels are a non-issue, which is nice, but our AQI is ticking up towards moderate, thanks to ozone. Not ideal for deep breaths.</li>
  <li>Seriously significant chunks of the Hank Aaron State Trail are closed or impacted. Your usual route might be a no-go.</li>

## Today's Forecast: Chilly with a Side of Trail Detours

Let's not sugarcoat it: it's not exactly prime running weather out there today, February 28, 2026. While the sun *might* peek through a bit, expect partly cloudy skies and a 35% chance of snow showers, both day and night. Temperatures are hovering around 0-1°C (31-33°F) for a high, but it'll feel colder, dipping down to -7 to -4°C (18-24°F) overnight. If you're heading out, layer up like you're trying to win an Antarctic expedition, and watch your footing. Ice is a real possibility, especially on those less-trafficked paths.

### Air Quality & Allergens

The good news for allergy sufferers is that pollen is "Low." Take that small victory. However, our Air Quality Index is sitting at 69, which is in the "Moderate" range, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. For most of us, that's probably fine for a shorter, less intense workout. If you're asthmatic or have other respiratory issues, you might want to consider dialing back the intensity or sticking to indoor options.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  The combination of cold temperatures and a moderate AQI with ozone means if you have sensitive lungs, take it easy or move your workout inside. Don't be a hero.

### Trail Talk: Hank Aaron State Trail is a Minefield of Closures

Now for the real kick in the pants: if the Hank Aaron State Trail is your go-to, you're going to need a new plan or a serious tolerance for detours. The "River Loop" section, a popular stretch, has been shut down since last August and won't be reopening until later this winter due to the 16th Street bridge replacement. But wait, there's more! Another section, specifically around 32nd Street and Canal Street, is also off-limits from February 1st through June 2026. This is all thanks to the ongoing I-94 project, which, while necessary, is certainly putting a crimp in our outdoor cardio. They've got a detour set up on the north lane of Canal Street, but let's be real, a detour next to construction isn't exactly a scenic, zen-inducing run.

And it's not just the Hank Aaron. The 27th Street Viaduct is fully closed to traffic through late 2026 for the same I-94 project. While this mostly impacts drivers, it can certainly mess with your plans if your running route involves crossing that area.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  Portions of the Hank Aaron State Trail (River Loop and 32nd/Canal St.) are closed or rerouted through winter/spring 2026. Check local park updates before you head out, or you'll be doing an unplanned urban adventure.

Honestly, today might be a solid day to hit the gym, if that's your thing. Or, if you're stubborn like me and need that fresh-ish air, stick to familiar routes in your neighborhood, bundle up, and stay vigilant for icy patches and those pesky construction cones.
