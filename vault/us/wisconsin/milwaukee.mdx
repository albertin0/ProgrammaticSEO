Today's a "meh" kind of day for hitting the pavement in Milwaukee; you can get it done, but don't expect perfection.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

### Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering in the "moderate" zone, thanks to our old pal ozone, so if your lungs are finicky, take it easy.
*   Temperatures are actually creeping up to the mid-40s F (around 7°C), a blessing after this week, but those southerly gusts at 10-20 mph, especially along the lakefront, are still going to try and slap you around.
*   Good luck with your usual long run route on the Hank Aaron State Trail – parts are still messed up with bridge construction and I-94 project work through winter 2026.
</BulletList>

Look, I'm all for getting out there, but let's be realistic. You're not going to brag about this run. The air isn't doing us any favors today. With an AQI of 71 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, your lungs aren't getting the pristine stuff. For most of us, it's just a bit annoying, but if you've got asthma or any respiratory issues, consider a shorter, less intense workout, or maybe just stick to the treadmill. Don't push it just because your running watch told you to.

The weather is *trying* to be decent. We're looking at a high around 7°C (mid-40s F), which feels downright balmy for late February in Milwaukee. But don't get cocky. The wind, particularly near Lake Michigan, will make it feel colder, and you'll be fighting those gusts on exposed stretches. Remember that wind chill is a real thing.

### Hank Aaron Trail Closures
If your route usually involves the Hank Aaron State Trail, be warned: sections are actively closed for ongoing construction. The River Loop and the area near 32nd Street and Canal Street are particularly affected due to the 16th Street bridge replacement and I-94 project work. There are detours, but they're not always ideal, pushing you onto less-maintained or busier roads. Plan your route ahead of time unless you enjoy unexpected detours and dodging traffic.

### Layer Up, Wisco Style
Even with temperatures warming, dressing in layers is key. Start with a moisture-wicking base, add an insulating layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. You'll thank me when you're not soaked in sweat five miles in, or shivering on the lakefront. Don't forget gloves and a hat – your extremities are always the first to complain.

### Mind the Air for Sensitive Lungs
While the overall AQI is "moderate" at 71 with ozone, the American Lung Association's 2025 report (which, yes, covers past data, but gives us context for Milwaukee's persistent issues) gave our metro area an F grade for ozone pollution. If you're in a sensitive group, you might experience minor symptoms with prolonged outdoor exposure. Listen to your body and cut your workout short if you feel any discomfort.
