It's a fantastic day to get outside, *if* you know where you're going and don't mind a detour or two.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lungs rejoice:** Air Quality Index is squarely in the "Good" zone at 47, and pollen is practically a no-show. Breathe deep, folks.
*   **Joints are happy:** A mild 12.5°C (that's a lovely 54.5°F for the Fahrenheit crowd) under clear skies means no battling the elements. Perfect running weather, honestly.
*   **Trail trouble ahead (and currently):** While the weather is prime, a bunch of our favorite greenways and parks are dealing with closures and hazardous conditions. Don't just lace up and go; you'll hit a wall, literally.
</BulletList>

Look, the weather gods are smiling on us today. A clear, mild Thursday in late February is a gift, especially for those of us tired of dodging ice patches or running in a parka. The air quality is pristine, sitting at a healthy 47 AQI, and if you're usually battling seasonal sniffles, today's low pollen count is your personal victory parade.

However, before you throw on your shorts and head out the door with reckless abandon, a reality check is in order. Our beloved trail system is currently a minefield of closures and maintenance, and ignorance is *not* bliss.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Major Trail Closures: Don't Get Stuck

You know **Gravois Greenway, aka Grant's Trail**? That beautiful stretch between Officer Blake C. Snyder Memorial Park and I-55? Yeah, it's closed. And it's not a quick fix. They're replacing and repairing bridges, so expect this section to be out of commission until early spring 2026. A detour is in place, but that still means re-routing your carefully planned mileage.

And it's not just Grant's Trail. St. Louis County Parks, like sections of **Creve Coeur Park** (specifically the gravel trail at Mallard Lake and parts of the paved bicycle trail), are closed for maintenance or deemed hazardous. **Dr. Edmund A. Babler Park** has rerouted its equestrian trail and the paved bicycle trail is not open to bikes due to surface hazards. **Kinloch Park** and **Mitchell Park** are closed entirely for construction, and even **Spanish Lake Park** has a horse trail closed due to a mudslide. If your regular route takes you through any of these, you need a Plan B.

### Plan Your Route, Seriously.

Always check park and trail websites before you head out. These closures are active, and running into a "TRAIL CLOSED" sign mid-stride is a special kind of frustrating. Look for official detour maps if you're determined to hit a specific area. Trust me, your knees (and your sanity) will thank you.

On the bright side, no specific large-scale events are blocking our usual running paths today. Most scheduled happenings are indoors, like the Bridge Championship (unless you're running *to* it, I guess).

One small note for tomorrow: the National Weather Service is predicting elevated fire danger for Friday due to strong southwesterly winds and very dry conditions. While that's technically tomorrow, the air is already "extremely dry" today. So, be mindful of any outdoor burning if you're doing more than just running.
