Alright, St. Louis, it's a solid day to get out there and actually enjoy your workout, provided you know where to look and what to dodge.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are pleasant, finally feeling less like mid-winter and more like actual spring is on its way. Perfect for a long run or ride without freezing your eyelashes off.
*   Pollen is practically nonexistent, so your sinuses can take a much-needed break from the usual St. Louis allergy assault.
*   Construction continues its relentless march across the metro, so plan your routes carefully unless you enjoy playing Frogger with orange cones and heavy machinery.

## The Air You Breathe & The Pollen You Don't

Let's get this out of the way. Today's not going to make your eyes water from tree jizz, which is a rare win for our spring-forward, winter-backward climate.

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Low          | N/A           |

The air quality, however, is firmly in "meh" territory. AQI is hitting 68, primarily driven by those delightful inhalable particulate matters (&lt;10µm). If you're one of those folks whose lungs decide to put up a fight over anything less than pristine air, maybe keep your high-intensity intervals inside today. For the rest of us, it's not a deal-breaker, but it's not exactly mountain air either.

With a clear sky and a comfortable 9.4°C, the weather itself is pretty fantastic for outdoor activity. Ditch the multiple layers; a long-sleeve and shorts or light tights should do the trick.

## Navigating the St. Louis Obstacle Course

Now, for the fun part: dodging the city's perpetual state of "under construction." MoDOT's weekly report is a horror show of closures and lane shifts, especially on major arteries like I-44, I-55, I-70, and I-270. This means if your route takes you anywhere near these, expect detours and potential congestion, even on pedestrian paths that run alongside. The ongoing work on the I-270 Chain of Rocks Bridge area means narrowed lanes and ramp closures, so if you're planning to run or ride a portion of the Riverfront Trail up that way, proceed with extreme caution and be ready for unexpected turns.

**Heads up, Trail Runners:** If you prefer natural surface trails, many county parks have them closed. Dr. Edmund A. Babler Park's paved bike trail is even closed due to hazardous surfaces, and Spanish Lake Park's horse trail is mudslide-affected. Don't assume your favorite dirt path is open; check county park websites before you head out.

### Forest Park: Art, Traffic, and Your Run

Our beloved Forest Park is always a draw, but this weekend, "Art in Bloom" at the Saint Louis Art Museum is throwing a wrench into the usual flow. From today through Sunday, Fine Arts Drive is one-way, east to west, from the Zoo towards the Norman K. Probstein Golf Course. One lane for cars, one for shuttles and emergency vehicles. This means more foot traffic, more cars, and generally more chaos than usual around the museum. If you're doing laps, be aware.

**Forest Park Pro-Tip:** If you're running or cycling through Forest Park this weekend, consider sticking to the outer loops or less congested areas away from the Art Museum. And as always, watch out for tourists staring at their phones while wandering into your path.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Construction Everywhere:** Seriously, check MoDOT's Traveler Information Map if your run involves any urban routes. There's resurfacing on Route 100 (Chouteau/Manchester) with new bike lane considerations, and I-55 bridge work that's supposedly wrapping up by summer, but "early 2026" closures are still a thing. Don't get caught off guard.

Overall, today's weather is a gift, but the usual St. Louis gauntlet of construction and localized park issues means you still need to run smart. Go get those miles, but keep your head on a swivel.
