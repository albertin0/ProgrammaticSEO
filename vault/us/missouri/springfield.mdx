Alright, Springfield, today's shaping up to be a pretty decent day to get outside, provided you watch your step and maybe don't push the lung capacity quite to its max.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are mild and the sun's out, which is a welcome change from the gray.
*   Pollen count is playing nice and staying low.
*   Air quality is moderate, so no need for an N95, but sensitive folks might feel the particulate matter.
*   Recent heavy rains mean some of our favorite spots could still be a muddy mess or have standing water.
*   Construction is a constant companion in this city, so expect some detours or uneven surfaces.

### Why today is/isn't the day

Let's be real, the sun and 9.6°C with low pollen? That's practically a gift this time of year. Get out there and soak it up. Just don't go thinking it's all sunshine and daisies everywhere.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step! Lingering Flood Impacts**
Remember that "significant flood event" we had from February 18-25? While the skies are clear now, that much rain doesn't just vanish overnight. Areas along the James River and other local tributaries, especially those low-water crossings or sections of our beloved greenways that follow creeks, could still be holding water or be dangerously muddy. The South Creek Greenway, which weaves right alongside South Creek, is a prime candidate for some soggy patches. Don't be that person who has to get rescued from a flash flood you thought was "just a puddle." Turn around, don't drown, and certainly don't get your new running shoes covered in Ozarks mud if you don't have to. NOAA's even predicting a wetter-than-normal spring, so this won't be the last of it.

**Air Quality: Moderate, but keep it in mind**
Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 56 today, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. While it's not "stay indoors" bad, it's not pristine either. If you've got sensitive lungs, consider scaling back the intensity of your run or opting for a slightly shorter route. We've had reports of high winds stirring up dust and even some distant fires in the Southern Plains recently, so while it's not a direct smoke alert, there's certainly something floating around.

**Construction Chaos Continues**
Springfield's always under construction, and your workout route is no exception. We know there's ongoing work, like the Fassnight Greenway trail connection through Phelps Grove Park, which might still have sections closed or detours in place. Plus, the city is constantly planning for more road-related construction. Keep an eye out for unexpected closures, uneven surfaces, and heavy equipment. A little pre-run recon or sticking to known clear paths can save you a headache.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Level | Dominant Types |
| :----------- | :------------- |
| Low          | N/A            |

It's a good day to hit the pavement or the less-soggy trails, just don't forget your situational awareness.
