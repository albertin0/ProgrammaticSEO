It's a pretty decent day to get outside in Springfield, but keep an eye on that air quality, folks.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Clear skies and a comfortable 18.5°C (65°F) make for pleasant outdoor conditions.
*   Pollen levels are currently low, so your sinuses should catch a break.
*   Air quality is moderate due to inhalable particulate matter, which is always worth noting for sustained exertion.
</BulletList>

Today's weather is looking clear and mild, hitting a high of around 19°C (66°F), which is fantastic for a late February run or bike ride. The low pollen count means you shouldn't be sniffling your way through your workout, which is a rare win around here. However, don't let the nice weather completely distract you; the air quality is still sitting in the moderate range, primarily due to inhalable particulate matter. That’s not ideal if you’re planning on pushing your pace or going for an extra-long haul, especially if you have any underlying respiratory issues.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate AQI: Don't Breathe Too Deeply
With an AQI of 59, categorized by "Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm)," your lungs might be working a bit harder than usual to filter out airborne crud. If you're susceptible to respiratory irritation, consider toning it down or opting for an indoor workout today. Keep that effort level in check, even if you feel great.
</AlertBox>

On the local front, keep your eyes peeled for ongoing construction that can impact your routes. While no new major trail-blocking events have popped up in the last 24 hours, Springfield is always building something. Long-term projects like bridge reconstruction and sidewalk improvements, especially around major arteries like I-44 in Greene County, can definitely throw a wrench in your travel plans to and from the trails. If you're heading toward the Ozark Greenways, particularly segments near road crossings or areas undergoing infrastructure upgrades like the Grant Avenue Parkway project, factor in potential detours or extra vigilance.

Speaking of the Greenways, remember your trail etiquette. The Ozark Greenways are open from sunrise to sunset for non-motorized use. Stick to the right, announce yourself when passing, and for goodness sake, keep Rover on a leash and pick up after him. We all share these precious resources, so don't be *that* person.

### Mind the Temps Later This Week
While today is mild, the forecast for the next few days shows colder temperatures dipping into the 20s-teens (Fahrenheit) each morning from Friday through Tuesday. If you're planning your week, remember that these comfortable temps won't last. Start preparing your layers now.
