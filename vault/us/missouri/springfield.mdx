The weather is playing a bit of a trick on us today, runners. Yeah, it's clear and not too cold, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a perfect day without concerns.

<BulletList>
  *   **Windy & Dry Conditions:** While the sun's out, we're looking at unseasonably warm temperatures and southwest winds gusting up to 20-25 mph, creating elevated fire weather conditions across the area. Not exactly ideal for long, exposed efforts.
  *   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI of 69 with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't terrible, but it's enough to feel it if you're pushing hard, especially if you have sensitive lungs.
  *   **Tricky Trail Surfaces:** With temperatures hovering around freezing overnight and then warming up to almost 10°C (50°F) today, those soft-surface trails around the Ozarks are likely to be a muddy, rutted mess. Don't be "that guy" tearing up the trails.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. It's Friday, the sun's trying to make an appearance, and it's not freezing. But before you lace up and head out for your long run, give your plan a second thought. That "clear" sky comes with some baggage today.

## Air Quality & Allergies

Let's be real, if you've been around Springfield for more than a minute, you know our air isn't always pristine. Today, our Air Quality Index is clocking in at 69, which is just on the high side of 'moderate.' The main culprit? Ozone. If you've got asthma or are just generally sensitive, you might feel that extra burn in your lungs during an intense workout. This isn't the day to try and set a PR if you're prone to respiratory issues.

Good news on the pollen front – it's low. So at least your sinuses aren't conspiring against your lungs today.

## Weather Watch

Temperature-wise, it's a pretty mild 9.9°C (around 50°F) right now, but expect it to climb into the 70s later today, with partly sunny to partly cloudy skies. Sounds great, right? Wrong. The real issue is the wind. We're talking southwest gusts up to 20-25 mph. That's enough to feel like you're running into a wall half the time and practically flying the other, which can throw off your gait and lead to some wonky muscle recruitment. Plus, it's contributing to "elevated fire weather conditions" due to the low humidity. Keep an eye on the forecast for *next week* too; we're looking at an unsettled pattern with showers and thunderstorms Monday night through Thursday. Don't get caught out there without your waterproof gear.

## Local Hazards & Trail Talk

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Elevated Fire Risk:** Those dry, windy conditions mean you need to be extra cautious with anything that could spark a fire, especially if you're on or near wooded trails. Seriously, don't be the reason we have another controlled burn on the edge of town.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Road Closures to Watch:** If you're planning on running along or crossing **Nichols Street** between Kansas Expressway and Nettleton Avenue, forget it. It's closed until March 6th for sidewalk replacement. Plan an alternate route to avoid frustration and forced detours. Also, keep in mind there's ongoing new pavement construction on MO 125 N in Greene County, which could impact traffic if you're driving to your run spot. The Scenic Avenue Bridge is slated for closure around summer 2026 for about four months, so keep that in mind for future route planning.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Soft Trail Syndrome:** While I haven't seen specific *Springfield* trail closures for mud in the last 24 hours, the general regional reports indicate that with these fluctuating temperatures (near freezing overnight, warming up during the day), many unpaved trails are going to be soft, slick, and easily damaged. If you're leaving ruts or sliding around on the **Ozark Greenway**'s soft-surface sections, turn around. Preserve the trails for everyone. Stick to the paved sections today.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, it's not worth destroying a trail or risking an ankle because you *had* to get your dirt fix. There's always tomorrow. Or a treadmill.
