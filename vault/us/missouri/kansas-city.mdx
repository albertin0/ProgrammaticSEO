It's a pretty decent day for a Kansas City workout, *if* you know where to avoid the mud and the seemingly endless construction zones.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are mild and skies are clear, perfect for getting outside without freezing your ears off or sweating through your gear.
*   Pollen is playing nice, keeping those seasonal sniffles at bay for most of us.
*   However, don't let the sunshine fool you; many local dirt trails are still a muddy mess, and urban routes are peppered with construction detours.
</BulletList>

## Today's Kansas City Conditions

Today is bringing us 11.5°C (that’s a balmy 52.7°F for those still stuck in Fahrenheit) under clear skies. Low pollen means your lungs can breathe easy, and an AQI of 51, while technically "Moderate" due to inhalable particulate matter, is nothing to lose sleep over for the average runner. It’s a good day to push some mileage without feeling like you're sucking down a dust bunny.

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant              | Temperature | Condition |

| Low          | 51  | Inhalable particulate matter | 11.5°C      | Clear     |

## Watch Your Step, KC!

While the weather is cooperating, the ground underfoot is a different story for many of our beloved trails. The Urban Trail Co. is reporting that sections of the **Blue River Park** trails are partially closed due to mud, warning users to stay off unless they are "frozen solid." Believe me, no one wants to be *that* person leaving deep ruts in a newly thawing trail. Stick to pavement if you’re heading out there, or opt for trails known to drain better.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail Advisory: Muddy Conditions Persist!** Many unpaved trails, especially those in shaded or low-lying areas, are soft and slick. Check Urban Trail Co. updates before hitting dirt, particularly around Blue River Park. Using muddy trails causes damage and can lead to injuries.
</AlertBox>

If you’re sticking to the streets, be prepared for the usual KC construction shenanigans. The Missouri Department of Transportation and Kansas Department of Transportation have ongoing projects across the metro. Expect reroutes and lane closures, particularly around major arteries like I-70 and US-69. For example, the I-70 Improvement Project means ongoing changes to traffic patterns near downtown, and Indiana Avenue is closed under I-70 for bridge construction until late 2027. Even RideKC has bus reroutes due to street closures, like the one on 3rd and Grand. These can easily impact your planned running or cycling routes, so keep your head on a swivel.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Road Construction Alert: Multiple Closures!** Active construction is impacting various roads and potential running routes across Kansas City. The 3rd and Grand Street closure is causing RideKC reroutes until tomorrow, Feb 27, 2026. Always be aware of your surroundings, watch for signage, and consider alternate routes to avoid unexpected detours.

**Pro Tip:** If you're planning an urban run or bike ride, quickly check the KCMO Street Closure Map online. It shows active traffic control permits, which can save you a frustrating dead end or an unexpected detour mid-workout.

So, go ahead and enjoy the clear, mild air, but for your knees' sake and for the sake of our trails, be smart about where you put your feet down.
