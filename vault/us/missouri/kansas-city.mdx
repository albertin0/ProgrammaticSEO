Yeah, it's clear out there, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a perfect day for a PR. Kansas City's got some layers to peel back today.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That "Moderate" AQI? It's hiding some wildfire smoke rolling in from western Kansas, which means your lungs might not be thrilled if you're pushing it too hard.
*   Those unpaved trails? Still a muddy mess thanks to the freeze-thaw cycle. Unless it's solid ice, you're just going to tear them up and risk an ankle.
*   Construction is a constant in this city, and today's no exception, with major roadwork causing closures and detours.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

While the numerical AQI might be sitting at 66, which some folks would call "moderate," the reality is a bit more nuanced. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has issued an air quality health advisory for central and eastern Kansas due to wildfire smoke. That hazy look isn't just a picturesque filter for your Instagram. It's particulate matter. Your lungs don't care about a "moderate" number if there's smoke in the air; they care about what they're actually breathing. Ozone is the dominant pollutant listed, which is already rough on the respiratory system, but combine that with smoke, and anyone with asthma, allergies, or just a desire to not feel cruddy should take note.

  **Wildfire Smoke Advisory:** Even with a "moderate" AQI, the presence of wildfire smoke from western Kansas could make outdoor exertion risky, especially for sensitive individuals. Consider taking your workout indoors today.

### Trail Conditions: Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud

The weather forecast shows a high of around 15.1°C (59°F) and clear skies for most of the day, which sounds lovely, right? But we've had a classic Kansas City freeze-thaw cycle recently. Urban Trail Co. reports that trails are easily damaged when muddy, with advice to only ride or run when conditions are frozen solid or you'll leave impressions. Blue River Park trails might be "open" according to some reports, but use caution and respect the ground. If you're heading to a natural surface trail, expect soft, slick spots that are a recipe for twisted ankles or, at the very least, a frustratingly slow, messy run. Seriously, do the trails a favor and stay off them if you're sinking in.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Muddy Trails:** Many unpaved trails are likely still very muddy due to recent freeze-thaw cycles. Using them in these conditions damages the trails and increases your risk of injury. Opt for paved paths or an indoor workout instead.

### Roadwork & Events: Watch Your Step (and Your Route)

Our city's always under construction, and today is no different. If your route takes you anywhere near US 69/Vivion Road in Platte County, know that it's fully closed for pavement repair until March 25th. That means detours for cars and potentially annoying reroutes for runners. Also, KDOT has some ramp closures on US 69 at 135th Street today until 3 p.m. Plus, with ongoing discussions about **Swope Park Improvements**, you might encounter work crews or altered areas if you're running there in the future, so stay vigilant and check local parks department updates. The World Cup 2026 is still a ways off, but the emergency declaration in surrounding counties hints at future disruptions and increased traffic from visitors, with Swope Park even serving as England's home base. For now, it's just about watching for the orange cones.

  **Construction Zones:** Always be aware of your surroundings near roadwork. Detours aren't just for cars; they can funnel pedestrians into less safe areas. Stay visible and use extra caution.
