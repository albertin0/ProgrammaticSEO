Look, the sun's out and it's not freezing, but don't let that fool you into thinking today's an all-clear for hitting the pavement or trails without a second thought.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Your Lungs Aren't Thrilled:** While the official AQI reads moderate, some local forecasts are still calling it "poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups". The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, which isn't exactly a lung tonic. If you're sensitive, you might feel this one.
*   **Your Joints Will Hate You if You Hit the Dirt:** Most of our beloved dirt trails, like those out at **Blue River Park**, are currently a treacherous mess due to the freeze-thaw cycle we've been experiencing. Unless it's truly frozen solid (and it's not today, with temps climbing to 7.9°C and higher), you're just tearing up the trails and risking an ankle sprain in a mud pit. Stay off 'em.
*   **Urban Obstacle Course:** If your plan was an urban run, prepare for detours. There's plenty of construction going on, especially around the I-70 corridor, with multiple closures and pedestrian reroutes, including the Cleveland Ave. over I-70 bridge and a pedestrian bridge near Van Brunt Ave. Plus, that streetcar expansion means more road work down the line.

## Environmental Breakdown

Here’s the daily dose of what you’re breathing and dealing with:

| Category          | Level           | Notes                                                                                                    |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pollen**        | Low             | No excuses for sniffles today.                                                                           |
| **Air Quality**   | AQI 62 (Moderate)| Dominant pollutant: Inhalable particulate matter. AccuWeather still warns of "poor" air for sensitive groups. |
| **Temperature**   | 7.9°C (46°F)    | Expect it to climb into the mid-60s°F (17°C) later. Pleasant enough for a run, if the ground weren't garbage. |
| **Condition**     | Clear           | Visibility won't be an issue.                                                                            |

### What to Watch Out For

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Muddy Trails are Leg Breakers (and Trail Wreckers):** Seriously, with the ground saturated and temperatures above freezing, any dirt trail is going to be soft, sloppy, and ripe for injury. "If you leave a mark, leave the park," folks. Stick to paved surfaces today if you value your ankles and our trails.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Paved Paths are Your Friend:** The Riverfront Heritage Trail or the paved sections of Swope Park are likely safer bets if you *must* run outside. Just watch for standing water or residual muck from runoff. And yes, you might still encounter construction detours even on paved routes near I-70. Plan your route accordingly and check KDOT for the latest closures.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Air Quality for the Vulnerable:** An AQI of 62 is "moderate," which sounds fine, but the *type* of pollutant (particulate matter) combined with local warnings about "unhealthy for sensitive groups" means if you have asthma, COPD, or just typically get irritated by bad air, you might want to consider an indoor workout. Don't be a hero; your lungs will thank you.
</AlertBox>

Overall, it's a "tread carefully" kind of day. If you're a creature of habit who *has* to run, pick your battles wisely. Pavement is your safest bet.
