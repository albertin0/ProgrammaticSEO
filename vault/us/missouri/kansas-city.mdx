Alright, Kansas City, it's a deceptively good day out there, but don't let the sunshine fool you into thinking it's perfect for crushing those miles without a bit of caution.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The weather is absolutely prime for a run or ride, a far cry from the February chill we often endure. Enjoy that clear sky and 13.6°C.
*   Pollen is keeping its head down today, which is a win for anyone who usually struggles with spring sniffles.
*   However, that "Moderate" AQI with inhalable particulate matter means your lungs will be doing a little extra work, so don't push the pace like it's fresh mountain air.

### Air Quality & Your Lungs

Let's be real, an AQI of 53 isn't terrible, but it's not sparkling, either. That "inhalable particulate matter" tag means there's some fine crud floating around. If you're someone who gets a bit wheezy, or if you're planning a particularly intense session, maybe dial it back just a notch. Listen to your body – it's not a suggestion, it's a command.

<AlertBox type="info">
If you're typically sensitive to air quality, or if you're new to high-intensity outdoor workouts, consider easing into it today. Your lungs will thank you.

### Trail Conditions: Mud, Mud, Go Away!

Here's the real kicker for us trail runners and mountain bikers: those freeze-thaw cycles we've been having mean many of our beloved dirt paths are a soggy mess. Urban Trail Co. is explicitly calling out Blue River Park trails as "Partial" and "Closed unless frozen solid." Seriously, people, stay off the muddy trails. You're not just getting dirty, you're ruining it for everyone else and causing erosion. If you're leaving ruts, you're doing it wrong. Turn around. Go find some pavement or a dryer spot. Cedar Niles Park Trails, for instance, are open and should be okay, but still, proceed with caution and common sense.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Muddy Trails Ahead!** Many dirt trails, especially at lower elevations or in shaded areas, are likely soft or outright muddy due to recent weather. Respect trail closures and avoid using trails when they are wet to prevent damage. Blue River Park is a prime example of a spot that's likely a no-go for dirt today.

### Roadwork & Reroutes

Kansas City construction is, as always, a beast. There are various ongoing projects that, while mostly affecting drivers, could certainly impact your route to a trailhead or your urban running plans. KDOT and MoDOT are reporting numerous lane closures and even full road closures in areas like I-70, U.S. 69, and U.S. 71 for bridge replacements and other work. For instance, the Cleveland Ave. bridge over I-70 is closed until December 2026, and Benton Ave. near I-70 is shut down until Summer 2027. Plan your logistics if your usual starting point is near these zones.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Zone Ahead:** Significant construction around I-70, U.S. 69, and U.S. 71 could mean detours or delays getting to your workout spot. Check MoDOT and KDOT updates before heading out, especially if you drive to your running route.
