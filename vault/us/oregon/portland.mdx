Look, it's Portland. We all know "clear" weather in February means "don't trust it for five minutes." Today, however, is genuinely clear but with enough atmospheric funk and icy history to keep you honest.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is moderate due to inhalable particulate matter. Your lungs might not appreciate a full-throttle effort.</li>
  <li>It's chilly, hovering around 5.2°C (41°F). Dress like you mean it, or you'll regret it when that "clear" sky decides to spit.</li>
  <li>Recent weather and ongoing work mean trail closures and hazards are still very much a thing, especially if you're hitting the dirt.</li>
</BulletList>

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

While the pollen count is low – a small mercy for our perpetually congested city – the Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at 81, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. This isn't "stay inside or die" bad, but it's definitely in the "moderate" category. If you've got even a hint of a respiratory issue, or you just enjoy having fully functional lungs, maybe dial back that tempo run. Save the all-out sprints for a day when the air isn't doing its best impression of a dusty attic.

### Trail Troubles: Still Messy Out There

Remember that dense fog and those potential icy patches yesterday morning? That alert's expired, but the aftermath of past winter fun and ongoing repairs means our beloved trails are still a bit of a minefield.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Forest Park is NOT fully clear.** The Maple Trail between Firelane 4 and Koenig Trail is still shut down due to severe storm damage making a bridge unsafe. Repair work isn't even slated until "late winter/early spring 2026," so don't expect it to magically clear up for your afternoon run. The Ridge Trail parking area on NW Bridge Avenue is also indefinitely closed for safety reasons, including falling rock. Seriously, park somewhere else or take the bus. And if you're on the Wildwood Trail around mile 15.2, the bridge is out – there's a bypass, but use caution.
</AlertBox>

And let's not even get started on the Columbia River Gorge. Those December 2025 winter storms did a number on the USFS trails, especially in the Eagle Creek Fire burnscar, leading to landslides and damaged bridges. Eagle Creek Trail #440? Closed. The Historic Columbia River Highway (US 30) east Multnomah Falls viaduct? Closed for repairs until spring 2026, meaning no pedestrian or bike access either. If you're heading out there, assume closures and have a backup plan.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Street Smarts for Runners & Cyclists:** ODOT's got various road construction projects happening, especially on major thoroughfares like I-5, I-84, and I-205. While this is mostly for cars, watch out for "nighttime lane closures and pedestrian detours" on places like Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway and Barbur Boulevard. Always be visible and aware, because drivers around here are often, shall we say, "distracted."
</AlertBox>

### The Bottom Line

Today's a "go for it, but with caveats" kind of day. The clear skies are inviting, but the air quality demands respect, especially if you're pushing hard. And if you're planning on hitting a trail, particularly in Forest Park or anywhere in the Gorge, assume it's got issues and check ahead. Don't be that person surprised by a collapsed trail. Your knees (and lungs) will thank you for being smart.
