Alright, Portland. Today is one of those days where you really gotta ask yourself if that PR is worth an ER visit, especially if you're planning on hitting some of the more ambitious routes.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The AQI is hovering in the "moderate" zone, which means your lungs might not be too thrilled with a full-on effort, particularly if you're usually reaching for an inhaler.
*   It's a clear day, sure, but a chilly 4.1°C means you'll be starting cold, and those muscles and joints aren't going to thank you for skipping a thorough warm-up.
*   Trail closures and instability are still a thing, especially in our beloved Forest Park, making some of your usual loops outright dangerous.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality Check
Let's talk about the air. Our AQI is sitting at 70, with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) being the main culprit. This isn't "Red Alert, bunker down" territory, but it's definitely not "take a deep breath, it's pristine." If you've got asthma or any other respiratory issues, or even if you're just not feeling 100%, consider scaling back the intensity or duration of your workout. No need to push it when your body is already working harder to filter out junk.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Today's moderate AQI (70, with PM10) means those with respiratory sensitivities or children should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. Don't push hard intervals or long runs if you're in this group.
</AlertBox>

### Weather Woes (or lack thereof)
The good news is, it's clear out there. No rain, no significant wind to report. But don't let that "clear" fool you into thinking it's warm. At 4.1°C, exposed skin will get cold fast. Think layers, my friends. Wicking base layer, an insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell are your best bet. Gloves, a hat, and ear covers are not optional unless you enjoy numb extremities.

<AlertBox type="info">
It's chilly at 4.1°C. Layer up with moisture-wicking fabrics, and don't forget gloves, a hat, and ear protection to keep warm. A proper warm-up is crucial for cold muscles.

### Trail Trouble: Forest Park and Beyond
Here's where things get tricky for us trail junkies. Some of our favorite spots are still dealing with the fallout from past storms. Specifically, the **Maple Trail in Forest Park is still shut down between Firelane 4 and Koenig Trail** due to severe storm damage. They're planning repairs for "late winter/early spring 2026," but "planned" and "done" are two very different things in Portland construction. There's also that Ridge Trail parking area on NW Bridge Avenue that's indefinitely closed for safety.

Venture further afield into the Columbia Gorge, and you'll find even more closures. The Historic Columbia River Highway's east viaduct near Multnomah Falls is closed for repairs until spring, impacting all traffic, including pedestrians and cyclists. And forget about Eagle Creek and Wahclella Falls Trails for now; they're also closed due to storm damage, landslides, and general instability.

<AlertBox type="danger">
DO NOT ignore trail closure signs, especially on the Maple Trail in Forest Park or anywhere in the Gorge. These closures are for YOUR safety due to storm damage, landslides, or unsafe structures. Seriously, don't be that person.

### Pollen Report
On the bright side, pollen levels are low today, so at least your sneezes won't be competing with your heavy breathing.
