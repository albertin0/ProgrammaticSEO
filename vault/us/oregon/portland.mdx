If you're planning an outdoor workout in Portland today, prepare to bundle up and reroute, because the trails are a mess and the air isn't exactly crisp.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   It's a chilly 5°C (41°F) out there, perfect for stiff muscles if you don't warm up right.
*   The Air Quality Index is creeping into "Moderate" territory at 72, with ozone being the main culprit, which means your lungs might not love that tempo run.
*   Several popular trails and key roadways are either fully closed or under heavy construction, making your usual routes a gamble.

## The Air You Breathe (or Don't)

Today's AQI of 72 might not sound like much, but with ozone as the dominant pollutant, anyone with respiratory sensitivities should probably dial it back. Ozone forms when pollutants from cars and industry react in sunlight, and while 5°C isn't exactly sunbathing weather, it's still enough to cook up some questionable air. Running hard in this stuff means dragging more of it deep into your lungs. Think about it: is that PR really worth feeling like you've been breathing through a dirty sock? For most of us, it's a mild annoyance, but if you're asthmatic or have other lung issues, consider that indoor track or just an easy walk.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate AQI (72, Ozone) is no joke for prolonged, strenuous activity.** Consider lowering your intensity or duration, especially if you're sensitive.

## Trail Closures & Road Hazards: Portland's Labyrinth Edition

Good luck trying to stick to your favorite scenic routes today. Our fair city is a patchwork of closures and construction zones.

If you're a Forest Park regular, forget about the **Maple Trail** between Firelane 4 and Koenig Trail; that bridge is still out from storm damage and won't be fixed until spring. And don't even *think* about parking at the **Ridge Trail** on NW Bridge Avenue – that lot's closed indefinitely due to falling rock. Seriously, the city said "significant safety issues." Just walk, bike, or bus your way in if you insist on hitting that particular segment.

Down in the **River View Natural Area**, Trail 3 is completely out of commission due to "catastrophic trail failure," and a section of Trail 6 is similarly hosed. These aren't minor puddles; these are unstable areas. Don't be "that guy" who ignores the signs and ends up needing a rescue because you *really* needed to get those steps in.

And for those of you who venture further afield, the **Historic Columbia River Highway** is still closed to *all* users (pedestrians, bikes, vehicles) between Multnomah Falls and the Oneonta Trailhead until spring 2026. This is due to viaduct repairs. Don't try to sneak through; it's closed for a reason.

On the road front, the I-84 eastbound Exit 2 off-ramp to Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard is closed this morning until noon. More relevant to our running and cycling crowd, **US30** in Portland has periodic daytime lane closures with pedestrian detours and bikes being shunted into roadway travel lanes. This means you're sharing space with cars, and let's be honest, Portland drivers aren't always paying attention to us spandex-clad folk. Exercise extreme caution. Multnomah County also has various other road works, like bridge repair on NE Marine Drive over 223rd Avenue, keeping 223rd closed at Marine Drive. Plan your urban routes carefully, or just stick to neighborhood streets if you can.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Respect ALL trail and road closure signs!** Ignoring them puts you and potential rescue workers at risk. These aren't suggestions, they're warnings about actual hazards like collapsing trails and falling rocks.

## Weather & What to Wear

At 5°C and clear, it's brisk, but not freezing. Layer up, but think moisture-wicking undergarments, a fleece or light thermal layer, and a wind-resistant shell. Gloves and a hat are a must, especially if you're out early or late. There was a dense fog advisory yesterday morning, but that has lifted, and today should be clear. Visibility should be good, but reflective gear is always smart, particularly with all the construction detours throwing cyclists and pedestrians into unexpected traffic lanes.

## Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Thankfully, the pollen count is low, so at least your sneezes won't be adding to the general misery.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress in layers, wear reflective gear, and tell someone your route.** It's common sense, but easy to forget when you're itching to get out there.
