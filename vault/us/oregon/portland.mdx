Alright, Portland, if you're hitting the pavement before 9 AM, you're either dedicated or just didn't check the forecast. Today's a mixed bag, mostly thanks to Mother Nature trying to turn our morning into a foggy ice rink.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Dense Fog & Icy Pockets:** Early birds get the worm, but today they also get zero visibility and potential slick spots. KGW issued a Weather Impact Alert for dense fog and possible isolated icy patches through 9 AM, especially on untreated surfaces and bridges. Be smart.
*   **Moderate AQI (Ozone):** The air quality is sitting at a "moderate" 81 AQI with ozone as our star pollutant. If your lungs are finicky, or you're pushing hard, this isn't exactly prime breathing air.
*   **Persistent Trail Headaches:** Forget a serene escape in Forest Park. The Maple Trail, specifically between Firelane 4 and Koenig, is still shut down due to severe storm damage and an unsafe bridge, a repair job that's been in the works since late January. And don't even *think* about parking at the Ridge Trail parking area on NW Bridge Avenue; it's indefinitely closed for safety concerns like falling rock and inadequate pedestrian space. Plan your routes, people.
</BulletList>

Look, it's 9.4°C and otherwise clear, which *sounds* nice, but that early morning fog is no joke. If you're out there, treat every shaded corner and every bridge surface like it's actively trying to put you on your ass. That means slowing your roll, especially on the less-trafficked paths and side streets around places like Pittock Mansion access roads, where shade lingers and ice can persist.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Morning Mishap Alert:** Dense fog and isolated icy spots are a real threat until 9 AM today. Visibility is low, and untreated roads, bridges, and even some trails could be slick. If you must run early, stick to well-lit, familiar, and treated surfaces. Consider moving your workout indoors or later in the day when the sun has had a chance to burn off the fog and ice.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Trail Beta:** Beyond the immediate fog, Portland's trails are still recovering from recent winter weather. That Maple Trail closure in Forest Park isn't going anywhere fast, with bridge repair planned for "late winter/early spring." And if you're thinking of a drive to the Gorge, the Historic Columbia River Highway east of the Historic Lodge is still closed for viaduct repairs until later this spring. Also, for those planning adventures further out, the Historic Highway from Larch Mountain Road to Vista House is scheduled for a five-day closure in *late February* for hazardous tree removal. Stay updated before you go.
