Alright, Portland, let's talk about hitting the trails today. Honestly, it's a bit of a mixed bag, like finding out your favorite food cart is closed but there's a new, promising one around the corner.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Moderate AQI is a drag on your lungs.** That 79 AQI with inhalable particulate matter means anyone with existing respiratory issues should seriously reconsider, and even the rest of us should dial it back. It’s not wildfire smoke, but it's not exactly crisp mountain air either.
*   **It's chilly, but clear.** A brisk 4.2°C might wake you up, but it won't be doing your cold joints any favors if you don't warm up properly.
*   **Trail closures are still a thing.** If you were planning on a long run out on the Historic Columbia River Highway near Multnomah Falls, you're out of luck. That section between Multnomah Falls and the Oneonta Trailhead is still shut down until spring for repairs. Same goes for a chunk of Forest Park.
</BulletList>

## The Rundown: A Moderate Dose of "Meh"

We're looking at a mostly clear day, which is a win after some of the February gloom. However, that 4.2°C is a sneaky kind of cold. It’s not freezing, but it's enough to make your muscles stiff if you jump straight into it without a proper dynamic warmup. Trust me, your knees will thank you later.

The real buzzkill for your lungs is that AQI of 79. That's in the "moderate" category, which sounds mild, but with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) as the dominant pollutant, it means folks with asthma, bronchitis, or other breathing issues should probably stick to an indoor workout. Even if you're tough as nails, you're still pulling that stuff into your lungs.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads up on the air quality!** With an AQI of 79 and particulate matter as the culprit, sensitive groups should be cautious. Don't push it.

### Trail Talk: Closed for Business

If Forest Park is your go-to, be aware that the Maple Trail between Firelane 4 and Koenig Trail is still closed due to some gnarly storm damage making a bridge unsafe. They're supposedly fixing it this "late winter/early spring," but for now, it's a no-go. The Ridge Trail parking area on NW Bridge Avenue is also indefinitely closed for safety reasons, including falling rock. Seriously, the city's trying to keep you from getting conked on the head, so respect those closures.

And for those of you dreaming of epic Gorge runs, the section of the Historic Columbia River Highway between Multnomah Falls and the Oneonta Trailhead is completely closed to all users until Spring 2026. This is due to ongoing repair work on the east viaduct. You can still hit Multnomah Falls via I-84 Exit 31, but you won't be running that scenic stretch westbound from Exit 35.

If you're out and about in Tigard, be aware that the Fanno Creek Trail at Scholls Ferry Road is undergoing some construction for traffic signal pole installation, so expect some single lane closures and pedestrian detours.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Stay off closed trails!** The Maple Trail in Forest Park and the Historic Columbia River Highway near Multnomah Falls are closed for legitimate safety reasons. Detour or find an alternative.

**Dress in layers, you dingus.** It's 4.2°C, which means you'll start cold but warm up fast. Wear breathable layers you can shed.
