It's February 28th, Eugene, and if you thought you were going to glide through your run without a hitch today, think again. It's cold, the air quality is just okay, and good luck navigating some of our prime running spots without a detour.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>

*   **Chilly temps demand real gear.** At 2.1°C (35.8°F), your lungs and joints are going to feel it if you don't dress smart. Layer up, people.
*   **"Moderate" AQI is still a concern.** That fine particulate matter isn't doing anyone's lungs any favors, especially if you're pushing hard or have sensitivities.
*   **Pre's Trail access is a mess.** The Autzen Canoe Canal Footbridge (and likely the adjacent Pre's Trail Bridge over the Canoe Canal) is out for the count, along with heavy construction on Leo Harris Parkway, forcing reroutes around a popular running corridor.

## The Air You Breathe (and the Pollen You Don't)

Here’s the current breakdown:

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant                  |
| :----------- | :---- | :---------------------------------- |
| Low          | 68    | Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) |

Good news on the pollen front – it's low, so your nose probably won't be staging a rebellion today. However, that AQI of 68, with fine particulate matter dominating, is officially "Moderate." For most folks, it's probably fine, but if you've got asthma or any other respiratory issues, this is your warning sign. Cold air already constricts airways, add in those particulates, and you're just asking for trouble. Keep your pace reasonable.

## Bone-Chilling Realities

That 2.1°C temperature is no joke. It's clear out, which is nice for visibility, but don't let the sun fool you into thinking it's warm. Your muscles and joints are going to be stiff, and cold muscles are injury-prone muscles. Take extra time to warm up properly—dynamic stretches, a slow jog to start. And for the love of all that is holy, wear layers. You can always shed a jacket, but you can't magically conjure one out of thin air if you underdress. Seriously, frostbite on your ears isn't a badge of honor, it's just poor planning.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Don't Skimp on the Warm-Up!
With temperatures hovering just above freezing, cold muscles are prime candidates for strains and pulls. A proper 10-15 minute dynamic warm-up is non-negotiable. Think leg swings, torso twists, and high knees before you hit your stride.
</AlertBox>

## Construction Chaos on Your Favorite Paths

This is where things get really annoying for anyone trying to get some miles in. The **Autzen Canoe Canal Footbridge** is closed for refurbishment until at least April 1st. This means your usual route through Alton Baker Park, particularly connecting to Pre's Trail, is impacted. And it's not just the bridge; there's ongoing construction for the new University practice facility along Leo Harris Parkway, meaning pedestrian detours and heavy equipment are a daily reality.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Pre's Trail Access Severely Limited!
The Autzen Canoe Canal Footbridge, a key access point to Pre's Trail, is closed until April. Expect significant detours and increased caution around Leo Harris Parkway due to ongoing university construction. Large trucks and equipment are present, so stay alert and follow all signage.
</AlertBox>

Beyond the park, watch out for paving work on East 24th Avenue, Hilyard Street, and Alder Street, which could cause minor disruptions. There's also construction creating moderate traffic impact at W 30th Avenue and Portland Street. If your route takes you on Crow Road, be aware of flaggers controlling traffic from 7 AM to 7 PM due to sign and guardrail installation.

I'm seeing some mentions of a "TrackTown Triathlon" today, but local running shops aren't listing major events. It's always a good idea to double-check race calendars if you're planning a route that crosses common race courses, but the primary hazards today are definitely the cold and the persistent construction.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Plan Your Reroute
With the Autzen Canoe Canal Footbridge closed, you'll need to adjust your Alton Baker Park/Pre's Trail plans. Consider soft-surface paths near the Emerald Valley BMX park or the Cuthbert Amphitheatre as alternatives, or explore routes further away from the university construction zones.

So, lace up, bundle up, and be prepared to get a little creative with your route. It's not the worst day, but it's certainly not a "set it and forget it" kind of run.
