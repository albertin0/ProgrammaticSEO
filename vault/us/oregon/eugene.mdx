Alright, Eugene, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the dirt today. Honestly, it's a bit of a mixed bag, so temper those expectations.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky is nice, but it's hiding some fine particulate matter, pushing our AQI into the moderate zone. Don't be fooled.
*   Major trail closures are still in effect, especially for our beloved Pre's Trail, which means you'll be rerouting.
*   Pollen is practically nonexistent, so your sniffles can take a break.

## Today's Air & Your Airways

Look, the environmental data says "Clear" skies, and the temp is a cool 6.5°C (about 44°F), which usually screams "go run!" But hold up. Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 82, and the culprit? Fine particulate matter, or PM2.5. An AQI of 82 means the air is "moderately polluted." For most of us, this is just a nuisance, but if you've got sensitive lungs, asthma, or any heart issues, you're going to feel it. Those tiny particles can irritate your respiratory system and, frankly, just aren't good for you over the long haul. So, while it *looks* crisp outside, your lungs might be working a bit harder than you think. Don't push it if you're feeling sluggish.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate AQI Alert:** With an AQI of 82 driven by PM2.5, sensitive individuals should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Your lungs will thank you.

## Trail Closures & Detour Headaches

Here's the real kick in the shorts for us runners and cyclists: significant trail closures are impacting some of our prime routes. The biggest offender right now is the **Pre's Trail Bridge over the Canoe Canal**, which is completely shut down for resurfacing until April. That's right, one of the main arteries for your riverside miles is out of commission. You *can* get to the south side of Pre's Trail by heading east near the Emerald Valley BMX track and over that bridge, but it's a pain.

It's not just Pre's, either. If you usually weave through the Riverfront Parkway area, be aware. Pedestrian access on the west side from Franklin Blvd to Millrace Dr is closed, as is the south side of Millrace. Even the bike lanes on both sides of Riverfront Parkway are closed until new striping is finished.

On top of that, there's ongoing construction for a new multi-use path on **E 24th Avenue, Hilyard Street & Alder Street** near Tugman Park. While sidewalk access is generally maintained, you'll be navigating excavation and concrete work. Stay alert and respectful of the crews out there.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Pre's Trail Bridge CLOSED:** Access over the Canoe Canal on Pre's Trail is completely shut down until April 2026 for resurfacing. Plan your routes to avoid this section!

**Construction Zone Awareness:** Always use caution and obey signage in construction areas, like those around Tugman Park and Riverfront Parkway. Detours are there for a reason – follow them!

## The Silver Lining

On the bright side, if allergies usually cripple your outdoor ambitions, today is your day. Pollen levels are blessedly low, so you can breathe easy on that front. The temperatures are cool, though with a slight wind, it might feel closer to 0°C (32°F) wind chill at times, so layer up.

All in all, today demands a bit more planning and awareness than usual. Pick your routes wisely, listen to your body, and don't expect any PRs when you're navigating detours and breathing in moderate PM2.5.
