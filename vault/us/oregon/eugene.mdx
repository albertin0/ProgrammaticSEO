Alright, Eugene. Today's a classic "get out there, but know where you're going" kind of day, thanks to some lingering construction annoyances and just-okay air.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   AQI is pushing "moderate" due to ozone, so if your lungs are already finicky, maybe dial it back or stick indoors.
*   Pre's Trail Bridge over the Canoe Canal is still closed for resurfacing until April, forcing detours for your planned riverside loops. Plan ahead or risk getting stuck.
*   Cool, clear weather is perfect for a run, but don't let it make you complacent about those detours or the occasional bit of sloppy ground from recent rain.

## The Daily Grind: February 26, 2026 Edition

Look, I'm all for embracing whatever the Willamette Valley throws at us, but let's be real: today isn't a banner day, but it's not a bust either. The temperature is a brisk 4°C (about 39°F) and it's clear out there, which sounds dreamy until you remember our delightful local quirks.

The main buzzkill for runners, cyclists, and anyone trying to move quickly along the river is the ongoing closure of the **Pre's Trail Bridge over the Canoe Canal**. Seriously, this thing has been shut down since mid-February for resurfacing and isn't slated to open until April. If your usual route involves that stretch, you're looking at detours. There are signs, bless their hearts, suggesting alternative routes near the Emerald Valley BMX track or heading south at the Cuthbert Amphitheater entrance. Just assume your Strava segment PRs are on hold for that section.

**Trail Closure Alert:** The Pre's Trail Bridge over the Canoe Canal is closed for resurfacing until April 2026. Plan your routes to avoid this section, as pedestrian and bike access is completely cut off.

On the air quality front, we're sitting at an AQI of 78, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. That pushes us firmly into the "moderate" category. For most of us, it's probably not a huge deal, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or just a general sensitivity to airborne nastiness, you might feel it. Your lungs are working harder to filter that crud, so don't push the pace like it's a completely clean air day. Low pollen count is a win, though.

Speaking of construction, it's not just Pre's Trail. There's paving work on E 24th Avenue, Hilyard Street, and Alder Street this week, specifically a new multi-use path near Tugman Park. While they're claiming sidewalk access will be maintained, anyone who's actually *run* through a construction zone knows it often means dodging equipment, uneven surfaces, and generally being extra vigilant. Rain earlier in the week might also mean some muddy, slick spots even on a clear day. Also, don't forget the long-term construction at Suzanne Arlie Park for those new mountain bike trails, and the Ridgeline Trail expansion towards Spencer Butte Park. These aren't closing major thoroughfares today but remind you to stay alert and respect any marked closures if you venture off the main paths.

**Footing Fundamentals:** Even on clear days, recent rains mean surfaces can be slick or uneven, especially near construction zones or on less-maintained paths. Watch your step, particularly if you're out on any of the sections with ongoing work.

So, go get your miles in. The cool air is invigorating. Just don't expect a completely clear run on all your favorite routes, and maybe keep the harder efforts for another day if your respiratory system is feeling the effects of that ozone.
