Look, it's not the worst day to be outside, but you're not getting any medals for bravery or smart choices either.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is sitting at a grumpy 75, fueled by fine particulate matter. So yeah, your lungs might not love you by the end of it.
*   It's hovering around freezing at 2.9°C (that's 37°F for the old-school crowd), which is great for ice patches and tight muscles, terrible for your joints and anything resembling comfort.
*   Construction is a nightmare all over, and some of our favorite trails are actively trying to swallow people. Plan accordingly, or don't, see what happens.

## The Rundown: Don't Be a Hero, Be Smart

Alright, Salem, let's talk about it. The official weather might say "Clear" [cite:] but everything else is yelling "Caution, you idiot!" We're sitting at a chilly 2.9°C (37°F) [cite:] and while the sun *might* peek through, expect that ground to stay cold and damp. The biggest gut punch for outdoor enthusiasts is the ongoing impact of recent storms and relentless construction.

First up, your lungs. That AQI of 75, with fine particulate matter running the show, is firmly in the "Moderate" category. For those of us who actually *use* our lungs for things like, you know, breathing hard, this isn't ideal. While most folks won't drop dead, if you've got any respiratory issues, you'll be feeling it. AccuWeather says it's "generally acceptable," but also warns sensitive groups about "minor to moderate symptoms from long-term exposure." So, if your long run turns into a wheezing marathon, don't say I didn't warn you. The good news? Pollen is practically non-existent today, so at least your sinuses get a break.

### AQI Alert: Watch Your Breath
With an AQI of 75 and fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, sensitive individuals might experience respiratory symptoms. Consider scaling back intense or prolonged outdoor efforts.

Now, for your precious joints and limbs. That near-freezing temperature is begging for a proper warm-up. Don't skip it unless you enjoy pulled hamstrings and stiff knees. More critically, the city is a minefield of construction. The **Center Street Bridge** seismic retrofit project is kicking off in 2026 and will be a multi-year affair, impacting not just traffic but also access to our beloved Riverfront and Wallace Marine Parks. Expect lane closures, ramp closures, and even short-term full bridge closures. This isn't just an inconvenience; it can force you into unsafe detours.

### Trail Disaster at Silver Falls State Park!
Heads up, waterfall chasers: Silver Falls State Park has announced emergency trail closures effective February 27, 2026, due to recent storm damage, including landslides and downed trees. While parts of the Trail of Ten Falls might be open, *do not* mess with barricades or closed areas. It's not worth breaking your neck for an Instagram shot.
</AlertBox>

On top of that, Marion County has reported various road closures for utility work and capital improvements, including sections of 22nd Street SE, Court Street NE, and Silverton Road NE. These are mostly for vehicles, but if you're running or cycling, you need to be hyper-aware of your route. Marion County also mentioned Road 75th Ave NE is closed at "Highwater Gates," which is code for "something's wrong, possibly water-related." Factor in the cold, and you've got an increased risk of slips, trips, and falls on any slick or uneven surfaces.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Construction Chaos: Plan Your Route
With major work on the Center Street Bridge and numerous other city road projects, always check for closures before you head out, especially if your route takes you near downtown or major arteries. These projects mean less space for you and more frustration.
