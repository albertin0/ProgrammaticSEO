Alright, Salem, if you're looking to pound some pavement today, you're mostly in the clear. Just don't expect balmy breezes or a completely pristine atmosphere.

<BulletList>
  <li>The air's got a moderate amount of ozone floating around, so if your lungs are finicky, take it easy.</li>
  <li>It's chilly out there, 4.2°C, but at least the sky's clear. No excuses about rain, just cold.</li>
  <li>Keep your head on a swivel, because there have been recent reports of coyote activity in West Salem and general safety concerns at popular spots.</li>

## The Full Rundown for your Salem Sweat Session

First off, let's talk air. Your lungs are dealing with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 77, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While this isn't "stay indoors and hermetically seal yourself" bad, it's definitely not "take a deep cleansing breath of mountain air" good either. AccuWeather calls it "Fair" and says sensitive groups might get some minor to moderate symptoms from prolonged exposure. So, if you've got asthma or any other respiratory quirks, maybe dial back the intensity or shorten your run on the Minto-Brown Island Park trails. For the rest of us, it’s generally acceptable, but don't be surprised if you feel a bit more phlegmy than usual.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### Moderate Ozone Levels
  Today's AQI is 77, primarily due to ozone. If you're a sensitive individual, especially with respiratory conditions, consider reducing the duration or intensity of your outdoor workout. Your lungs will thank you.

Weather-wise, it’s a crisp 4.2°C (that’s about 39.5°F for those still stuck in Fahrenheit) and clear. Perfect for layering up, getting those muscles warm, and maybe seeing your breath puff out like a steam engine. Just remember that clear skies in February in Oregon often mean frosty mornings, so watch your footing if you're hitting the streets or unpaved sections around the Willamette River.

Now, for the stuff that'll make you double-check your surroundings. There was an update about a knife attack at **Wallace Marine Park** just a couple of days ago, on February 24th. It's a great park, but be aware of your surroundings, especially if you're out alone or at dawn/dusk. On a similar note, there's been an active search for a coyote that attacked a woman in West Salem during the daytime, reported on February 19th. If you're running the trails on that side of the river, particularly any less-trafficked paths, stay vigilant. Earbuds in? Keep the volume low, or better yet, just one in so you can hear what's going on around you.

  ### Local Safety & Wildlife Alert
  Be extra aware of your surroundings today, especially if you're on trails or in less populated areas of parks like **Wallace Marine Park** or in West Salem. Recent news includes updates on a knife attack at Wallace Marine Park and a coyote attack in West Salem.

Finally, let’s talk about that never-ending saga: construction. There are intermittent lane restrictions on I-5 northbound and southbound within Salem (MP 248.00 to MP 252.00) between 9 PM and 5 AM, with work wrapping up around February 28th. While this is mostly for drivers, if your route takes you near these sections during those late/early hours, expect extra noise and be cautious of work zones. Looking ahead, the big **Center Street Bridge seismic retrofit** is slated to begin in mid-2026. That's going to be a multi-year headache, with major lane closures for about six months and full closures for a few nights. Start thinking about your alternative routes now if that bridge is part of your regular run. Construction on the McGilchrist Complete Street Project and Downtown Streetscape projects are also ongoing or resuming in spring/summer 2026, so expect various detours or reduced pedestrian access in those areas.

Overall, it's a decent day for a workout if you dress for the cold and stay sharp. Just don't wander around aimlessly and assume everything's perfectly peachy. This is Salem, after all, not a resort brochure.

  ### Upcoming Bridge Construction
  The **Center Street Bridge seismic retrofit** is scheduled to start in mid-2026. This multi-year project will include significant lane closures and some full closures, severely impacting travel between West Salem and downtown. Plan alternate routes in advance.
