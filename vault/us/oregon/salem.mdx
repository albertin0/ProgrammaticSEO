Alright, Salem, if you're itching to get out there today, you can probably manage it, but don't say I didn't warn you about the lingering crud.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That "Clear" condition at 6.7°C (44°F) sounds nice, but don't be fooled; the forecast shows a good chance of clouds hanging around, making it feel a bit more dreary than advertised.
*   Your lungs might not be thrilled with an AQI of 83. While not red-alert bad, it's firmly in the "Moderate" zone, thanks to that inhalable particulate matter floating around. This is especially true if you're pushing hard.
*   Remember that blizzard from a few days ago? While the snow emergency parking ban is lifted, the ground conditions around some of our beloved trails, especially in low-lying areas like Minto-Brown Island Park, are still a mess. Expect potential icy patches, standing water, and mud from the recent precipitation and snowmelt. Marion County even warns about falling trees.
*   Construction continues to be a headache. The Center Street Bridge seismic retrofit project is kicking off this year and will impact Riverfront and Wallace Marine Parks, so expect detours or blocked access. Even the Capitol's North Plaza is still under construction until mid-March.

## Your Daily PT Notes & Warnings

Look, the temperature is decent enough at 6.7°C, which is about 44°F. That's a good running temp. But let's talk about what's *actually* on the ground. The recent snowstorm might be over, but its ghost is still very real. I'd be wary of hitting any unpaved trails at Minto-Brown today. That park is notorious for flooding in winter conditions, and with the snowmelt, you're likely to find sections submerged or just plain boggy. Unless you're trying to simulate a trail race through a swamp, stick to the paved stuff there, or better yet, opt for higher ground.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** The combination of recent snow, current temps, and general winter crud means you're almost guaranteed to hit some slick spots, especially in shaded areas or on less-trafficked paths. A twisted ankle on a random patch of ice isn't a badge of honor, it's a trip to urgent care. And nobody wants to see me in the clinic on a Thursday.
</AlertBox>

The AQI being 83 isn't ideal for a long, hard effort. It's not "stay indoors and seal the windows" bad, but it's enough to irritate sensitive lungs, especially with that particulate matter. If you're asthmatic or have other respiratory issues, seriously consider scaling back your intensity or keeping your workout shorter. It's not worth huffing down microscopic crap just to hit your splits.

**Construction Zone Ahead:** If your usual route takes you near the Center Street Bridge or anywhere in Riverfront or Wallace Marine Parks, plan for interruptions. The seismic retrofit on the bridge is a multi-year project, and it's going to mess with our waterfront access for a while. Check city maps for detours *before* you head out, or you'll be adding an unplanned navigation challenge to your run.
</AlertBox>

Pollen is low, so at least your nose won't be running a marathon alongside your legs. That's something. But really, today's all about playing it smart. If you absolutely have to run outside, keep it short, stay on well-maintained, visible paths, and look down. Constantly.
