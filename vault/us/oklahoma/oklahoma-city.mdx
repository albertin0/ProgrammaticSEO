If you're dead set on getting your miles in today, February 28, 2026, the weather is playing nice, but your lungs might have other plans.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Enjoy the clear skies and mild 15.7°C (around 60°F) temps, which are perfect for a run or ride.
*   High pollen counts are here, primarily cedar/juniper, elm, and maple, so don't forget your allergy meds if you suffer.
*   The Air Quality Index is moderate at 54, with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) as the dominant pollutant. Mix that with high pollen, and you've got a recipe for some irritated airways.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type      | Level |
| :--------------- | :---- |
| Cedar/Juniper    | High  |
| Elm              | High  |
| Maple            | High  |

It's a beautiful day for Oklahoma City, but don't let the sunshine fool you into thinking it's totally clear sailing for an outdoor workout. While there haven't been any major reports of trail-blocking disasters in the last 24 hours, the air itself warrants some caution.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Air Quality & Allergies Are No Joke**

That "Moderate" AQI with fine particulate matter is just enough to get your lungs working harder than they should, especially when combined with the "High" pollen count across the city. Think twice about pushing a hard interval session today. Your respiratory system is already under assault from all that cedar, elm, and maple. Don't be surprised if your usual route along the Bert Cooper Trails near Lake Hefner leaves you feeling a bit more winded than usual, even in this pleasant weather. If you're susceptible to allergies or asthma, consider an indoor alternative, or at least keep your effort level dialed down.

**Trail Conditions - Watch Your Step**

While OKC hasn't reported specific trail closures for wet conditions in the last 24 hours, reports from other parts of the region earlier this week mentioned "freeze/thaw" cycles leaving trails muddy and slick. Even with our clear weather today, shaded areas or low-lying sections of trails, like those along the Deep Fork River Trail where construction has been a known saga, could still be soft. If you're heading out, wear appropriate footwear and be prepared for potentially uneven or slippery surfaces. Best to check the OKC Parks Trail Closures WebApp before you head out, just to be sure your favorite path isn't a muddy mess or impacted by ongoing improvements.
