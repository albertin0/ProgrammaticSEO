Don't let that "clear" weather fool you; today's a mixed bag for hitting the pavement, especially if you're trying to stick to your usual routes.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That temperature might look nice on paper, but at 10.8°C (about 51°F), it's definitely on the cooler side for Orlando. Dress in layers unless you like being a human popsicle for the first mile.
*   Air quality is sitting at a "Moderate" 70 AQI, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. While not a red alert, sensitive lungs might still feel it, and there's always the ghost of Everglades smoke lingering.
*   Construction is a relentless beast in this city, and it's actively messing with your run plans, particularly on some of the popular trails.
</BulletList>

Look, the thermometer says 10.8°C and the sky is clear, which sounds like a dream for February in Florida, right? Not so fast, sunshine. While the air itself isn't actively trying to suffocate you like some of our muggier days, the AQI is at a middling 70 thanks to ozone. That means if your lungs are already a bit finicky, or you're pushing serious mileage, you might feel that extra bit of irritation. We've also had brush fires kicking off in the Everglades down south, and while the wind isn't directly blowing thick smoke over downtown Orlando today, the potential for hazy skies and that distinct "Florida burning" smell is always there. Highlands County, not too far, is already bracing for it.

But the real kicker for us runners? It's the obstacle course Orlando has become. Forget setting any PRs if your route involves downtown or north. The **Orlando Urban Trail** through Ivanhoe Village, specifically between Magnolia Avenue and Highland Avenue, has been completely shut down since January and won't be open for another few months. It's all for "infrastructure upgrades" – read: they're replacing ancient pipes, which is great for the city, terrible for your cadence. They've put up detour signs, but let's be real, it's never as straightforward as they make it sound, and you're likely ending up on less runner-friendly sidewalks or dodging traffic.

And that's just one spot. The City of Orlando's road closure list reads like a novella. We're talking ongoing construction on Brookhaven Drive for "The Yard," Muriel Street near Wadeview Park, and patches of Summerlin Avenue are all varying degrees of a mess. Even if you're sticking to the main roads to avoid trail closures, watch out for the constant lane shifts on major arteries like I-4, S.R. 436, and U.S. 17-92. These are primarily for drivers, sure, but they cause ripple effects, pushing cars onto residential streets and making your run a lot less zen and a lot more "dodge the Corolla."

<AlertBox type="warning">
Expect detours and potential traffic hazards around popular running areas. Plan your route ahead of time and be prepared to improvise, or risk adding accidental mileage (and frustration) to your workout.

<AlertBox type="info">
With the current cooler temperatures and moderate AQI, now might be a good day to stick to a treadmil run if your chosen outdoor route is heavily impacted by construction, saving your joints from uneven surfaces and your lungs from unexpected pollutants.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

No excuses on the pollen front today, allergy sufferers. It's a low count, so breathe easy on that score. Just don't inhale any construction dust or exhaust fumes instead.
