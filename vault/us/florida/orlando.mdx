If you're planning on a run or ride outside in Orlando today, February 28, 2026, be prepared for some dampness, mediocre air, and your usual dose of local construction headaches.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That "Clear" sky we were promised? Don't bet on it. Expect some light rain today, so anything not under cover could be slick.
*   Air quality is sitting in the moderate zone, primarily thanks to ozone. Your lungs might notice if you're really pushing the pace.
*   Construction continues to be the unofficial sport of Central Florida, with several major closures that might reroute your usual haunts.

## The Down-and-Dirty Details for Your Orlando Workout

Look, it's not the worst day ever to get outside, but it's far from perfect. The temperature is a pleasant 18.4°C (about 65°F), which is great for avoiding that typical Florida sauna feel. However, the forecast is calling for some light rain showers throughout the day. This means surfaces, particularly on less-maintained sections of multi-use paths or the older parts of trails like the Cady Way, could be a slip-and-slide waiting to happen. Watch your footing, especially around corners or on any wooden bridge crossings.

### Don't Breathe Too Deeply: Moderate AQI

Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is hitting 83 today, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While "moderate" doesn't sound terrible, it means that if you're unusually sensitive or planning a high-intensity, long-duration workout, you might experience some respiratory irritation. Ozone isn't your friend, especially when you're sucking down lungfuls of it. Consider dialing back the intensity a notch or sticking to indoor options if you have asthma or other lung conditions.

And speaking of things that never end, let's talk about construction. The City of Orlando's love affair with orange cones is still going strong. The section of the **Orlando Urban Trail** between Magnolia Avenue and Highland Avenue, particularly near Ivanhoe Village, has been shut down since early January and is expected to stay that way for about four months for critical infrastructure upgrades. This means detours, probably poorly marked, and definitely more traffic than you want when you're trying to find your zen on a run. Plan your route accordingly, or be ready to play Frogger with cars and distracted pedestrians.

Beyond the Urban Trail, if you regularly traverse roads like Orange Blossom Trail (OBT), be aware that road closures for crashes and construction are a regular occurrence, even if not directly impacting your specific workout route today. There's also ongoing, long-term construction out in Horizon West on projects like the New Independence Parkway extension, which while not right in the urban core, can affect anyone trying to get to some of the outlying trails.

The state is also still dealing with significant drought conditions, with 67% of Florida in extreme drought as of yesterday. While there isn't an active fire weather warning for Orlando today, the elevated risk is always present, and we've seen how "super fog" from fires can mess with air quality and visibility further south. So, keep an eye on the horizon – literally.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Overall     | Low   |

Pollen is thankfully low today, so at least your sinuses might get a break from one of Florida's favorite irritants.

### Gear Up for the Drizzle and Detours

*   **Rain Gear:** A light, breathable rain jacket or hat will serve you well.
*   **Visibility:** With cloud cover and potential rain, wear bright colors, especially if you're sharing roads with traffic near construction zones.
*   **Plan Ahead:** Check the City of Orlando's road closures website before you head out, and map out alternative routes around the Urban Trail if that's your usual stomping ground.
</AlertBox>

All in all, today's workout in Orlando will demand a bit more awareness than usual. Don't let a little rain or ozone stop you, but don't say I didn't warn you.
