If you're planning on a long, clear run today, Hollywood, you better get out there *now* before the afternoon decides to get dramatic.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **AQI's a bit hazy, literally.** We're sitting at a "Moderate" 77, with inhalable particulate matter leading the charge. Great, just what your lungs needed.
*   **Construction is the gift that keeps on giving.** Major work on A1A means lane closures and detours, especially if your route takes you anywhere near Van Buren to Jefferson Streets. Add in dust from I-95 work, and your "clear" conditions feel less pristine.
*   **Afternoon storm roulette.** The forecast is playing coy with "scattered thunderstorms developing in the afternoon" and a 60% chance of rain. Winds could kick up too. Don't be that person caught in a downpour miles from home.
</BulletList>

Look, I love our city, but sometimes running here feels like an obstacle course designed by someone who hates knees. Today's one of those days where you need to be smart, not just fast.

The good news? Pollen levels are low, which is a rare treat for us Floridians. Enjoy it while it lasts.

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

| Category | Level    | Notes                                         |
| :------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **AQI**  | Moderate | 77, Dominant Pollutant: Particulate Matter    |
| **Pollen** | Low      | Enjoy the clear sinuses, folks. |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step (and Your Lungs) on A1A:** Seriously, if your route includes A1A between Van Buren and Jefferson Streets, be ready for single-lane closures. They're undergrounding utilities, which means open trenches, uneven surfaces, and potential detours. Traffic's going to be a mess, and that means more exhaust and kicked-up particulate matter for your lungs to deal with. Maybe consider the quieter residential streets east of Federal Highway if the Broadwalk is too congested.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Afternoon Storms Are a Real Possibility:** Don't let that morning sun fool you. Forecasters are calling for scattered thunderstorms this afternoon, and some could even bring "damaging wind gusts or hail". Check the radar before you head out for any afternoon sessions, and have an indoor backup plan. Getting struck by lightning or pelted with hail isn't going to help your PR.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration & Awareness:** It's still South Florida, folks. While 21.4°C (around 70°F) sounds lovely, with potential humidity and a late-day climb to the mid-80s, you still need to hydrate like it's your job. Also, keep an ear out for traffic alerts. There's an "Operation Paintbrush" event happening this morning at 1600 S. Park Road which could cause localized minor disruptions. Better safe than sorry, especially with all the various lane closures happening throughout Broward County.
