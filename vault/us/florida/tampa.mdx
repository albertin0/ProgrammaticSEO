Another fantastic day to hit the pavement or the trails, Tampa. Don't let the calendar fool you into thinking it's still deep winter; we've got some prime running weather.

<LungsJointsScore score={8} />

<BulletList>
*   Temperatures are sitting pretty in the low 50s this morning, heading for the mid-70s, making it nearly perfect for getting those miles in without baking or freezing.
*   Pollen counts are low, so your sinuses can relax for once.
*   Air quality is moderate due to ozone, so if you're usually coughing after a long run, maybe dial it back slightly.

## Today's Tampa Trail Talk

Alright, listen up, because while the weather gods are smiling, the road crews are still hard at work. This is Tampa, after all; construction is as inevitable as humidity in July.

You're looking at a clear morning, with temperatures rising nicely. That 11.8°C (53°F) you woke up to? It's just going to get better. Expect a partly sunny day, warming up to a comfortable 24°C (75°F). Ideal running conditions for most, especially if you get out before the midday sun really kicks in.

However, let's not pretend it's all sunshine and daisies. The Air Quality Index is currently sitting at 70, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Now, 70 is "Moderate," meaning it's generally acceptable. But for those of us with sensitive lungs, or if you're planning an exceptionally strenuous session, ozone can be a pain. It tends to be worse during the hottest parts of the day, so keep an eye on how you feel. If your chest feels tight or you're wheezing, cut it short. It's not worth pushing through.

### Mind the Moderate Air Quality
Today's AQI is 70 due to ozone. If you're a runner with asthma, COPD, or other respiratory sensitivities, take it easy. Consider shortening your usual route or reducing intensity, especially in the afternoon when ozone levels can peak.

Now for the real Tampa Bay challenge: navigating the orange cones. FDOT and the city have got projects going on everywhere, and while most major *road* closures are happening overnight, you can bet your favorite pair of Hokas that there's always something affecting pedestrian or bike access nearby.

For instance, if you're heading toward Bayshore Boulevard, while the path itself should be clear of *events* (Gasparilla was weeks ago, thank goodness), getting there might involve some detours due to ongoing street maintenance or utility work. The City of Tampa even launched a new platform, one.network, specifically to track all this. It's a good idea to check it if you're driving to a trailhead, because a five-minute drive can easily turn into a twenty-minute crawl around a sudden lane closure. There's also that massive South Hillsborough Pipeline project still causing lane closures around South Kings and West Bloomingdale Avenues if you're out that way.

### Plan Your Route Around Construction
Check the City of Tampa's one.network platform before you head out, especially if you're driving to a trail or park. Unexpected detours around construction zones are a common headache and can eat into your workout time.

Overall, it's a stellar day to be active outside, just be smart about your lung health and your route. No excuses for staying on the couch, but also no awards for ignoring your body or getting stuck in traffic.
