Alright, Tampa, if you were planning on hitting the pavement this Saturday, February 28th, you might want to adjust those expectations.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Rain, Rain, Go Away (or Gear Up!):** The clear skies you might have hoped for are out. We're looking at a decent chance of rain and even some afternoon showers or storms today. Don't be surprised if those "gusty" conditions hit.
*   **Breathe Easy-ish?:** The AQI is clocking in at a moderate 80, with ozone as the main culprit. On top of that, there's a chance of lingering patchy smoke from those Everglades wildfires, especially early this morning. So, your lungs aren't getting off scot-free.
*   **Event Chaos & Detours:** Julian B. Lane Riverfront Park is swarming with the Gasparilla Festival of the Arts. Plus, there's the Tampa Taco Fest at Al Lopez Park, and a Yankees Spring Training game. Downtown's going to be a madhouse with road closures and congestion. Trying to run through that is a workout in itself, but probably not the kind you signed up for.

## Today's Rundown

Honestly, if you're not a fan of dodging raindrops, inhaling ozone-laced air, and weaving through crowds like it's a game of human Frogger, you might want to reconsider that long run. While the temperature sits at a comfortable 18.4°C, that's about the only thing going for us on the "pleasant" front.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Afternoon Storm Risk
Keep an eye on the radar. Forecasts indicate a "best shot at afternoon showers and a few storms," with a small chance some could turn "strong and gusty." That's not ideal for being out in the open, especially if you're planning a long session around Bayshore Boulevard.

### Air Quality & Wildfire Smoke

The Air Quality Index is at a moderate 80 today, primarily due to ozone. But let's talk about the elephant in the room – or rather, the smoke in the air. A massive 25,000-acre wildfire is still raging in the Everglades. While Tampa isn't directly in the path, lingering patchy smoke was expected to affect areas as close as Miami this morning. If you're sensitive, or just value your lung capacity, today's not a day to push it. Moderate AQI combined with potential smoke is just asking for trouble.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Downtown Congestion is REAL
Listen up, downtown runners. The City of Tampa issued a "Weekend Traffic Advisory" for February 27 - March 1. We've got the Gasparilla Festival of the Arts taking over Julian B. Lane Riverfront Park, plus a bunch of other events. Expect "congested streets and limited on-street parking availability." Seriously, if you planned on a leisurely jog along the Riverwalk or hitting up the parks in that area, prepare for crowds and detours. Construction on projects like the ONE Tampa luxury residential tower continues downtown, adding to the urban obstacle course.

### Beach Advisory Still Active?
Heads up if you're considering a beach run. As of February 23rd, there was an advisory for Davis Islands Beach due to high levels of fecal bacteria, expected to remain in effect until at least February 25-26. While today is the 28th, it's worth checking the Florida Healthy Beaches website before you dip your toes in, or, you know, fall face-first.
