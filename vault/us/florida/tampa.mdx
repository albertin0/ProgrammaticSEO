Yeah, you can hit the pavement today, but keep your head on a swivel.

  <li>The weather's pretty sweet today in Tampa: 16.7°C and clear skies mean you won't be melting or battling rain, which is always a win for outdoor activity.</li>
  <li>Pollen levels are blessedly low. Your sinuses can take a break, which is more than we can usually say for Florida.</li>
  <li>Air quality is moderate at an AQI of 58, with ozone being the main culprit. It's not terrible, but if you're sensitive, you might feel it.</li>
  <li>Ongoing construction is still a real headache for anyone trying to navigate the city, and parts of our beloved trails are just straight-up gone.</li>

Alright, Tampa Bay, let's talk turkey. It's February 25th, 2026, and while the weather gods are finally giving us a break with clear skies and a comfortable 16.7°C (that's a glorious 62°F for those still on Fahrenheit), it's not all sunshine and smooth sailing out there.

First, the good news for your lungs: pollen is low. Seriously, take a moment to appreciate this rare gift in Florida. For once, your post-run sniffles might actually be from exertion, not seasonal allergies. However, before you declare it a perfect day, remember that the Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 58, with ozone playing the dominant role. For most of us, that's fine, but if you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity, you might feel a bit of a burn, especially if you're pushing hard. Maybe dial back the intensity slightly if you're usually affected by moderate AQI.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Ozone & Your Lungs:** When the AQI is moderate due to ozone, consider shifting your runs to earlier in the morning or later in the evening when ozone levels are typically lower. This is especially true if you're sensitive or have existing respiratory conditions.

Now, for the persistent pain in every runner's and cyclist's backside: construction. It's Tampa, so of course, it's everywhere. Major projects like Water Street Tampa and GasWorx in Ybor City mean constant detours and unexpected hazards on sidewalks and roads. But here's the kicker for trail users: a significant portion of the **Upper Tampa Bay Trail** has been closed since January 7th. They're replacing a culvert damaged during those lovely hurricanes Helene and Milton (remember those? Good times). This closure is specifically east of Sheldon Road and north of the Channel A waterway near West Waters Avenue, and it's expected to last "several weeks." So, if your usual route takes you through there, you're out of luck. Don't be that person who tries to sneak through; it's closed for a reason, and you're just putting yourself and the workers at risk.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Upper Tampa Bay Trail Closure Alert:** A section of the Upper Tampa Bay Trail, specifically east of Sheldon Road and north of the Channel A waterway, is *closed* for culvert repairs. Do NOT attempt to use this portion of the trail. Find an alternative route.
</AlertBox>

Beyond the trail, road closures are still a thing. Harney Road under I-75 is completely shut down nightly tonight and tomorrow for overhead bridge work. Also, if you commute or run near the interstate, expect nightly closures on the westbound I-4 ramp to southbound I-75 through tomorrow, February 26th. These aren't just minor inconveniences; they can force you into unfamiliar, potentially unsafe areas if you're not paying attention.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Road Closures & Detours:** Be aware of significant nightly closures on Harney Road under I-75 and the westbound I-4 ramp to southbound I-75. Check FDOT Tampa Bay for updated detour information before heading out for a night run or ride.
</AlertBox>

In short: it's a decent day for a workout thanks to the weather and low pollen, but stay vigilant. Plan your route, especially if you're a trail runner or cyclist, and assume there will be construction everywhere else.
