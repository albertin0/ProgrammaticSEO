If you're looking to crush a new PR on Bayshore Boulevard today, pump the brakes, champ. You might just be sucking in more than just the sweet Tampa Bay air.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Smoke on the Horizon (and in your lungs):** Don't let that "Clear" weather fool you. We've got massive wildfires burning down in the Everglades, scorching over 24,000 acres, and those shifting winds are pushing smoke plumes north. While the heaviest concentrations might be further east in Highlands County, the resulting inhalable particulate matter (PM10) is jacking up our AQI. Your 61 AQI score for Tampa isn't terrible, but with PM10 as the dominant pollutant, it's a clear sign of that smoke creeping in. If you can smell it, your lungs are definitely feeling it.</li>
  <li>**Construction Chaos Continues:** Surprise, Tampa is still building! Downtown is a perpetual construction zone with projects like One Tampa and the Gasworx development reshaping the skyline. Expect ongoing road work and closures, especially around major arteries like I-275 and I-4. If your route relies on predictable city navigation, you're in for a rude awakening.</li>
  <li>**Upper Tampa Bay Trail Still a No-Go:** If you were planning on hitting the Upper Tampa Bay Trail, forget about it. A portion east of Sheldon Road and north of Channel A has been closed since early January for culvert repair after hurricanes Helene and Milton. It's expected to be out of commission for "several weeks." Find an alternate route or prepare for an abrupt turnaround.</li>
  <li>**Sweet Relief (from allergens, at least):** On the bright side, pollen levels are low today, so your allergies shouldn't be giving you any grief. Plus, the 21.5°C (that's a comfortable 70.7°F for you non-metric folks) is pretty darn perfect for getting out there... if you can breathe properly and navigate the detours.</li>
</BulletList>

## Environmental Breakdown:

### Air Quality Index (AQI):
Your lungs are getting a moderate workout today, and not the good kind. The PM10 is the real kicker here.

| Index | AQI (0-500) | Health Advisory      |
| :---- | :---------- | :------------------- |
| Good  | 0-50        | None                 |
| **Moderate** | **51-100**  | **Unusually sensitive people should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion.** |
| Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups | 101-150 | Sensitive groups should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. |
| Unhealthy | 151-200 | Everyone should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. |
| Very Unhealthy | 201-300 | Everyone should avoid outdoor exertion. |
| Hazardous | 301-500 | Health warnings of emergency conditions. |

### Pollen Breakdown:

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

### Weather:
Clear skies and a pleasant 21.5°C (70.7°F). Ideal conditions, if only the air and roads weren't trying to thwart you.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **SMOKE ALERT:** Regional wildfires are impacting air quality. While not a "red alert" AQI, the presence of PM10 indicates fine particulate matter that can irritate lungs. Sensitive groups (asthmatics, elderly, children) should seriously reconsider intense outdoor activity. Everyone else, listen to your body. If you feel any irritation, cut your workout short.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **TRAFFIC & CONSTRUCTION CHAOS:** Be prepared for detours and delays. Major construction projects are ongoing, particularly in the downtown core. Check FDOT Tampa Bay for current road closures before you head out, especially if you're driving to a workout spot.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **PLAN B:** With the Upper Tampa Bay Trail partially closed, consider alternatives. The Courtney Campbell Causeway Trail might offer clearer air and an unobstructed path, but always check real-time conditions.
