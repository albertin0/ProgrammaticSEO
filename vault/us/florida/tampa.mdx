Alright, Tampa Bay, if you're thinking of hitting the pavement or trails today, it's a mixed bag—mostly clear skies but some sneaky stuff floating in the air.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Sketchy:** We're sitting at a moderate AQI of 63, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. That means the air isn't exactly *fresh*, and with drought conditions and wildfires kicking up in the region, don't be surprised if your lungs feel it.
*   **Smoke and "Super Fog" Risk:** Forecasters are warning about the potential for "super fog" in South Florida, a lovely cocktail of light wind, heavy smoke, and increased moisture that can cut visibility to mere feet. While that's south of us, with elevated wildfire conditions across the Florida Peninsula and dense smoke pooling near ongoing fires, don't be shocked if some of that crud drifts our way, especially in low-lying areas.
*   **Trail Closure:** If you were planning on a long run on the Upper Tampa Bay Trail, remember that a section east of Sheldon Road and north of the Channel A waterway near West Waters Avenue is still closed for culvert repairs. It's been shut down for weeks and isn't reopening today. Find an alternate route, or just embrace Bayshore Boulevard if you want a clear path.

## The Air: Clear, But Not Clean

Look, the weather itself is beautiful. We're talking clear skies and a comfortable 22.3°C (about 72°F) for your afternoon sweat session. Pollen is low, which is a rare win for us allergy sufferers. But don't let that fool you. That AQI of 63, driven by particulate matter, combined with the ongoing drought and regional wildfires, means you could be inhaling more than just good vibes. If you're sensitive, or planning a really intense session, consider an indoor option or keep your route shorter today.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Keep an Eye (and Nose) Out for Smoke
While the major "super fog" warnings are for South Florida, the conditions that create it—dry ground, wildfires, and light winds—are all present in the broader region. If you start smelling smoke or notice haze, especially later tonight or early tomorrow morning, cut your outdoor workout short. It's not worth compromising your lung health just to get those miles in.

## Water Woes

If your workout involves a dip or waterside activity, be aware that Davis Islands Beach had an advisory for high levels of fecal bacteria in the water as of February 19th, with new test results expected around today, February 26th. Until those new results clear it, maybe skip the swim there.
