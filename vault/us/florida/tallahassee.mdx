Alright, Tallahassee, stop procrastinating because today is about as good as it gets before things get squirrely.

<LungsJointsScore score={8.5} />

<BulletList>
*   Clear skies and comfortable temps mean you won't melt or freeze out there. The mercury's sitting at a pleasant 21.8°C (71°F), feeling even warmer, so shed that extra layer.
*   Pollen is playing nice, keeping allergy sniffles at bay for most folks, which is a rare gift this time of year.
*   Enjoy this window of opportunity; tomorrow's forecast is looking a bit… wet, with a 70% chance of scattered thunderstorms.

## The Rundown

Today, February 26, 2026, we’ve hit a sweet spot in the weather lottery. The air is clear, the sun is out, and the temperature is screaming "go run outside!" But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. While the conditions are generally favorable, a few local nuances mean you still need to keep your head on a swivel.

### Air Quality & Allergens

| Pollutant          | Level          | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------------- | :------------- | :----------------- |
| **AQI (Overall)**  | 64 (Moderate)  | Ozone              |
| **Pollen**         | Low            | N/A                |

Your lungs might notice the moderate Air Quality Index of 64, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. That means if you're sensitive, you might feel it a bit, especially later in the afternoon when ozone tends to peak. But for the average runner, it's not a deal-breaker. Good news for your nose, though: pollen levels are mercifully low.

### Weather Whims

We're looking at clear conditions today, a solid 21.8°C (71°F), and it feels like 24°C (76°F). Wind gusts could hit about 18 mph, which is enough to feel a breeze but not enough to knock you off your stride on the St. Marks Trail. The main weather hazard to keep in mind isn't for today, but for tomorrow. Forecasts are calling for scattered thunderstorms with a 70% chance of rain, and high humidity, so if you're planning a multi-day streak, make tomorrow your rest day.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration and UV Awareness:** Even with comfortable temperatures, the UV index is moderate (4). Slap on some sunscreen and carry water, especially if you're out for an extended period. Don't be that person who gets toasted on a "cool" day.

### Local Hazards & Trail Talk

Now for the real local flavor. While there aren't any immediate, widespread emergency alerts for Tallahassee today, we do have some ongoing situations to be aware of if you're hitting the pavement or trails.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Alert: Miccosukee Road Closure (Tomorrow):** If you're planning to run or bike near the Miccosukee Greenway, be aware that Miccosukee Road between Arendell Way and Thornton Road will be closed from 9 AM to 4 PM *tomorrow*, Friday, February 27, 2026. This isn't today, but it's close enough to mess with your morning plans if you don't adjust. Long-term, Old Bainbridge Road is also closed in sections until May 2026.
</AlertBox>

The Tram Road Multiuse Trail is currently undergoing construction as part of a project to enhance safety and connectivity, which means you might encounter localized disruptions or detours. Always pay attention to signage if you're venturing out there.

There's an active wildfire, the Foster Bridge Fire, about 45 miles away in Bristol, currently 50% contained at 675 acres. While the fire risk for Tallahassee is "Very Low" today and tomorrow, it's a reminder that dry conditions persist across the state, and things can change quickly. Don't be flicking any butts, people.

In short, today is a good day to get your miles in. Just keep an eye on your surroundings, know your route, and remember that tomorrow is looking like a wash.
