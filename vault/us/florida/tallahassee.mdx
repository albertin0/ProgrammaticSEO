It's a pretty decent Saturday to hit the pavement or dirt, but if your lungs usually put up a fuss, today might be a bit iffy.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Weather's Playing Nice:** At a cool 13°C (55°F) and clear skies, it's perfect running weather for your joints. No baking sun, no icy winds.
*   **Pollen Pales in Comparison:** For once, the pollen count is low, so your sinuses might actually thank you for that outdoor run. Take the win.
*   **Air Quality is a Mixed Bag:** The Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a moderate 87, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) as the main culprit. This means it's generally okay, but those with respiratory issues should pay attention.

## Today's Local Rundown

Looks like we dodged any major storm fallout or direct wildfire smoke hitting Tallahassee today, which is always a bonus. While Florida as a whole is seeing elevated wildfire conditions and dense smoke down south near Big Cypress, particularly impacting areas along Alligator Alley, we haven't seen those direct impacts here in the capital.

### What to Watch Out For

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Micro-Muck in the Air
While the overall AQI is moderate, the dominant pollutant is particulate matter. AccuWeather's forecast for today even calls for "Poor" air quality for sensitive groups due to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). If you have asthma, are older, or are just more sensitive, consider cutting your long run short or sticking to an indoor workout. You don't want to turn a refreshing jog into a wheezing session. Even though the PM10 levels were deemed healthy recently, the "poor" forecast for sensitive groups for today at an AQI of 87 means it's time to be smart.

### Construction Continues – Plan Your Routes
No new, sudden trail closures for today that we found, but remember that ongoing roadwork is a permanent fixture around here. Old Bainbridge Road, for example, is impacted by construction until May 2026. If you're planning a long haul on less-trafficked roads or trying to hit parts of the St. Marks Trail that might require street crossings near ongoing projects, double-check your routes. The city's always got something going on, like the Tram Road Multiuse Trail project, so be aware of potential detours or heavy vehicles, especially if you're venturing off familiar paths like the main St. Marks Trail into more urban connections or even around Tom Brown Park where projects like the Market District Stormwater improvements are still active.
