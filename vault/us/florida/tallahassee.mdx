Today's a pretty decent day to get outside, assuming you're not an Olympic-level complain-er.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are absolutely prime for running, not too hot, not too cold. Basically perfect for a longer effort without boiling alive or freezing your digits off.
*   Pollen count is finally playing nice, meaning your allergies might just give you a break for once.
*   The air quality, while not stellar, isn't going to send you to the ER, though there's a bit of extra crud floating around.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply, But Also, Breathe.

Look, Tallahassee is rarely *perfect* when it comes to air, and today's no exception. The AQI is clocking in at 67, which means it's "Moderate." The real kicker? Ozone is the dominant pollutant. What does that mean for your lungs? It's not *dangerous* for most folks, but if you've got asthma or are just generally sensitive, you might feel a little tightness, especially during harder efforts. Think of it as your lungs doing a little extra work.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Ozone Alert:** With an AQI of 67 and ozone as the main culprit, sensitive individuals (asthmatics, those with respiratory issues) might notice some irritation during prolonged or intense outdoor activity. Maybe dial back that tempo run a notch.
</AlertBox>

### Trail Conditions: Clear Skies, Clear Paths (Mostly)

The weather forecast is clear, which means no unexpected downpours or high winds to contend with. This is good news for hitting the St. Marks Historic Railroad State Trail. You won't be slogging through mud or dodging falling branches from some freak storm. I did a quick check on local news from the last 24 hours, and thankfully, no major trail closures or surprise construction projects have popped up to block your usual routes. No wildfires choking the air, no flash floods turning the Greenway into a swamp. Just clear skies and relatively smooth sailing.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Hydration Reminder:** Even if it feels cool, you're still sweating. Don't be that person who cramps up three miles into their run because they thought "cool weather = no water." Carry your bottle, folks.
</AlertBox>

### Pollen Report: A Rare Win!

For once, the pollen gods are smiling on us. The level is "Low," which is practically a miracle for Tallahassee. If you've been sneezing your way through every spring run, today's your chance to enjoy a breath of relatively clear air without feeling like your sinuses are staging a protest. Don't get used to it, though; it's Tallahassee, so the pollen will be back with a vengeance soon enough.

### What to Expect on the Trail

Expect a decent crowd, given the nearly ideal running temperatures. You'll likely see plenty of folks out on the Apalachee Regional Park trails. The ground should be firm, and the views clear. Just keep an eye out for other runners, cyclists, and the occasional dog walker who thinks a retractable leash is a good idea on a crowded path (it's not).

The bottom line? If you've been looking for an excuse to skip your workout, today's not it. Get out there, but maybe don't go for a PR on your lung-busting intervals until the AQI drops a bit more.
