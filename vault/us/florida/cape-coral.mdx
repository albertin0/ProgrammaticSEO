It’s a deceptively clear, cool morning out there, Cape Coral, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's an easy run.

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky is battling some serious wildfire smoke drifting our way from the Everglades, so your lungs might not love this.
*   If you had plans for a serene stroll or run at Rotary Park, forget it—portions are closed for repairs.
*   Construction on our roadways and trails continues to be a never-ending saga, so watch your step and your surroundings.

## Cape Coral Workout Weather & Air Quality: February 26, 2026

Alright, fellow Cape runners and outdoor enthusiasts, let's cut to the chase for today. The temperature is sitting at a pleasant 12.5°C (around 54.5°F) with clear skies right now, which on paper sounds fantastic for a workout. But hold your horses, because "clear" doesn't mean "clean" when it comes to the air you'll be breathing.

We've got an AQI of 67, putting us squarely in the "Moderate" category, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. But here's the kicker: there's a massive, 25,000-acre brush fire blazing in the Florida Everglades along Alligator Alley, and that smoke is *definitely* making its way into "nearby communities." Health officials are already putting out warnings for sensitive groups. So, while it might not be thick enough to see from your front door, those tiny smoke particles are still doing their thing to your lungs. Don't be surprised if your usual route feels a little... heavier on the chest today.

Good news for your allergies, at least. Low pollen levels mean one less thing to make you sneeze your way through a tempo run.

## Local Hazards & Headaches

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Wildfire Smoke Advisory
Despite the "clear" skies, smoke from the Big Cypress and Everglades wildfires (we're talking 25,000 acres near Alligator Alley) is still impacting air quality in South Florida. If you have respiratory issues, kids, or are just generally not a fan of inhaling burnt vegetation, consider an indoor workout or keeping it very light today. That AQI might climb.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Rotary Park Trail Closures
If your routine takes you to the Rotary Park Environmental Center, be advised: the Observation Towers and the Glover Bight Trail are *temporarily closed for repairs*. Don't get halfway there only to find your path blocked. Find an alternative route today.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Construction and Pedestrian Safety
Construction around Cape Coral is an ongoing beast. The Cape Coral Bridge project is gearing up for construction this year, which will definitely impact our mobility long-term. Also, Lee County is testing mechanical openings on the Matlacha Drawbridge this week, meaning potential traffic delays. More generally, the Cape Coral Police Department is running "High Visibility Enforcement Details" through May 8th because Lee County consistently ranks high in pedestrian and bicyclist crashes. So, for the love of all that is holy, drivers, *watch for people*, and walkers/cyclists, *be visible* and follow the rules of the road. No one wants to end up a statistic.

All in all, today is a day to be smart, not just tough. Those cooler temps are nice, but the air quality and trail closures demand some caution and flexibility in your plans.
