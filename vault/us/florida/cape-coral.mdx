Alright, Cape Coral, listen up: today’s a pretty decent day to get outside, but don’t forget we’re still dealing with some lingering crud in the air and the city's favorite pastime: digging up roads.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

### Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Moderate:** While the sky's clear, the AQI is sitting at a "moderate" 65, primarily due to ozone. This is likely influenced by the residual smoke from those wildfires down in Collier County that were causing travel headaches on Alligator Alley just yesterday. So, if your lungs are a bit finicky, take it easy, especially during peak afternoon ozone.
*   **Pleasant Temperatures, Low Pollen:** At a comfortable 23°C (around 74°F) and clear skies, the weather itself is prime. Plus, pollen levels are low, so your sinuses get a reprieve.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Cape Coral's never-ending roadwork saga means you’ll still encounter disruptions. The North 1 West Utilities Extension Project (UEP) is active, bringing "road work area locations/road closures for major roads and local roads" that could force you to re-route your run or ride.
*   **Rotary Park Partially Closed:** Heads up if you like to hit Rotary Park Environmental Center for some elevation gain (ha!). The observation towers are temporarily closed for repairs. So much for that scenic lookout.

## Know Before You Go

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Wildfire Smoke Lingering
Even though Alligator Alley reopened this morning, and the immediate visibility crisis has passed, the "National Fire" in Big Cypress National Preserve was still 0% contained as of yesterday. This means smoke is still out there. Your AQI is moderate, so keep an eye on how you're feeling, especially if you're prone to respiratory issues. What seems like a nice breeze could be carrying more than just good vibes.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Plan Your Route Around Construction
Seriously, it’s Cape Coral. Assume there's construction. There are ongoing utility projects (the North 1 West UEP is still kicking) and talks of Pine Island Road expanding. If your usual path takes you down major arteries or through residential zones undergoing infrastructure upgrades, you might find detours or uneven surfaces. Check city traffic advisories before you head out, or just embrace the adventure (and maybe some dusty shoes).
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch for Wildlife (Always, but especially near disturbed areas)
With all the construction and development, local wildlife is getting pushed around. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially near canals and preserves. Gators are always a possibility, and snakes are out and about. We live in their home, after all.
</AlertBox>

Enjoy your run, ride, or walk, Cape Coral. Just don't say I didn't warn you about breathing ozone or dodging cones.
