Don't let that morning breeze fool you, Fort Lauderdale; while it *looks* like a decent day, the air quality isn't quite as pristine as the postcard.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Weather's a Win (Mostly):** At a comfortable 16.3°C (around 61°F) and generally clear skies, the temperature isn't going to be your biggest hurdle. Just be aware of a "mostly cloudy" forecast during the day before it clears up at night.
*   **Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em (Don't):** Reports from just two days ago, February 24th, confirmed Everglades wildfires and sugar cane burns sending smoke and haze right over Broward County, with Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue fielding calls from concerned residents. While the provided AQI is 66 (which technically falls into "Moderate"), some forecasts suggest "Poor" air quality for sensitive groups today. That ozone isn't doing anyone any favors.
*   **Construction Zone Chaos:** Major headaches for runners and cyclists continue with numerous road projects. From sewer work around Victoria Park, Harbordale, and Rio Vista, to asphalt improvements and lane closures on major arteries, getting a clean route might require some serious dodging.

## The Daily Grind: What to Watch For

It's tempting to lace up and hit the pavement when the mercury isn't trying to melt your shoes, but hold your horses, or at least your deep breaths.

### Air Quality: Don't Go Hazy on Me

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :---- | :----------------- |
| Low          | 66    | Ozone              |

That AQI of 66, while technically "moderate," is pushing the boundary for sensitive individuals. Given the recent smoke from those Everglades fires and sugar cane burns, especially with northwest winds, you might still catch a whiff or feel it in your lungs. AccuWeather is even calling today's air quality "Poor" for sensitive groups, so listen to your body if things feel off. You're not trying to run through a perpetual barbecue smoke cloud, are you?

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Air Quality Advisory:** The AQI is technically moderate (66), but don't ignore lingering smoke or higher ozone levels. If you're sensitive, have asthma, or just generally enjoy breathing, consider an indoor workout or keeping your outdoor activity short and sweet. Recent wildfire smoke can still be in the mix.

### Construction: More Detours Than a Tourist Trap

The City of Fort Lauderdale is certainly busy. You've got ongoing lane closures on **North Federal Highway** and **Northeast 4 Avenue** starting *today*. Plus, that Sanitary Sewer Force Main Rehabilitation and Replacement Project is still active, impacting areas like Victoria Park, Harbordale, Rio Vista, and Sunrise Intracoastal with various road closures. If your usual route takes you near these neighborhoods or the **Port Everglades** area where sand bypass construction is happening, expect delays and reroutes. Seriously, planning your run through these zones without getting frustrated is a workout in itself.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Route Planning Required:** Expect construction-related disruptions, especially around Victoria Park, Harbordale, Rio Vista, North Federal Highway, and Northeast 4 Avenue. Check local city news for specific lane closures before heading out.

### Events: The Calm Before the Storm (of Crowds)

Good news for today: no major events are actively blocking large sections of trails or roads. The big ones like the Dolphins Cancer Challenge, Sistrunk Parade & Festival, and the Las Olas Art Fair are all scheduled for this coming weekend (February 28th and March 1st). So, enjoy the relative peace on the **Las Olas Boulevard** stretch while it lasts. Just remember that next weekend, you'll be dodging art enthusiasts and 5K participants.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Looking Ahead:** While today is clear of major events, next weekend (February 28-March 1) is packed with the Dolphins Cancer Challenge, Sistrunk Parade & Festival, and the Las Olas Art Fair. Plan accordingly if your long run falls on those days, as significant road closures will be in effect around Sistrunk Boulevard and Las Olas Boulevard.
