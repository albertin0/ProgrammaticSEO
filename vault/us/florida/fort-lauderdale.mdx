Alright, Fort Lauderdale, if your idea of a good outdoor workout today involves navigating a maze of street closures and breathing in some fine particulate matter, then by all means, lace up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh, Not Great:** With an AQI of 83 and inhalable particulate matter floating around, it's officially "Moderate" out there. If you've got lungs that complain, they're probably already doing so.
*   **Road Closures Galore:** Forget your usual long run down Las Olas Boulevard. The Art Fair has shut down E. Las Olas from SE 6th to SE 11th Avenue all day, and the Sistrunk Parade & Festival has Sistrunk Boulevard from NW 9th to NW 15th Avenue locked down for 12 hours. Good luck hitting those PBs with detours every five blocks.
*   **Humidity Hangover & Stormy Outlook:** The "Clear" weather is a bit of a tease. Temperatures are sitting around a muggy 21.5°C, but that 95% humidity means it feels warmer. And while it's clear *now*, the forecast hints at scattered afternoon thunderstorms, especially between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m., with a 75% chance of rain. Don't get caught out there.

## Today's Fort Lauderdale Fitness Rundown

Look, I get it. You live in a beautiful city, you want to run along the beach or bike the trails. But today, February 28, 2026, Fort Lauderdale is throwing a few curveballs your way, especially if you plan on doing anything extensive in the downtown core or along major arteries.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Mugginess and Mid-Afternoon Thunder
It's going to feel warmer than the thermometer suggests, thanks to some thick, soupy air. Stay hydrated, even if the sun's not beating down mercilessly. More importantly, keep an eye on the sky this afternoon. There's a solid chance of pop-up thunderstorms rolling through, which is less "refreshing rain" and more "lightning hazard" for your outdoor session.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for your sinuses, bad news for your excuses. Pollen isn't the problem today.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Event Chaos: Avoid Las Olas and Sistrunk!
Seriously, unless you're participating in the Las Olas Art Fair or the Sistrunk Parade & Festival, avoid these areas like a post-marathon porta-potty line. Las Olas Boulevard is completely shut down for the art fair, meaning no cruising or easy access for cyclists or runners. Sistrunk Boulevard is also heavily impacted by its festival. You'll spend more time dodging barricades and bewildered tourists than actually working out. Plan routes far away from downtown and main thoroughfares. Also, the Dolphins Cancer Challenge is happening today, which typically means more road impacts across Broward County. Double-check event-specific maps if you're trying to get anywhere near those areas.

### AQI 83: What it Means for You
An AQI of 83 falls into the "Moderate" category. For most healthy people, this isn't a huge deal for a regular workout. However, if you're part of a sensitive group (asthma, heart/lung conditions, young kids, elderly), consider toning down the intensity or duration of your outdoor activity, especially anything that has you breathing hard for extended periods. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), which can irritate your respiratory system. Maybe opt for a gym session or a less strenuous walk today if you're feeling iffy.

There's also ongoing construction all over Broward, including along Cypress Creek Road and the Henry E. Kinney Tunnel, leading to various lane closures that might mess with your planned routes. Always assume construction is happening somewhere and be prepared for detours.
