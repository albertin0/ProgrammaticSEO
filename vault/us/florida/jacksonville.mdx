Alright, Jacksonville, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the trails today. It's a pretty sweet day to get outside, but don't get too comfortable; there are still a few things to keep an eye on.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Clear skies and temps hovering around a perfect 22°C (that's low 70s for us Fahrenheit folks) mean you'll be comfortable out there.
*   Your lungs might feel a bit of the "Jax funk" with moderate AQI, so don't push it if you're usually sensitive to ozone.
*   Construction is still a thing. Plan your routes, especially if you're heading east.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe (and the Lack of Pollen, Thank Goodness)

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :---- | :----------------- |
| Low          | 70    | Ozone              |

Good news for your sinuses: pollen is low today. You won't be snotting your way through your mile repeats. However, the air quality index is clocking in at 70, which is "moderate," with ozone being the dominant pollutant. For most of us, that's just a mild annoyance, but if you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, take it easy. Ozone can be a real lung-burner.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Ozone Levels:** With an AQI of 70 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, sensitive individuals might experience respiratory irritation. If you're prone to lung issues, consider an easier pace or stick to indoor workouts today.

## Trail Talk & Roadblock Roulette

Our glorious Florida weather comes with a price sometimes, and right now, it's dry as a bone. Jacksonville has been enduring its second driest stretch since 1871, which means the wildfire risk is always lurking, even if a big blaze isn't directly on our doorstep. There are active brush fires down in the Everglades, kicking up smoke that's been drifting around South Florida. While it's not a direct hit on us today, conditions are ripe for fire, and Red Flag warnings have been issued for Central Florida, which isn't that far a stretch. Keep an eye on the horizon and trust your nose – if you smell smoke, don't run into it.

As for actual physical hazards, expect the usual Jacksonville construction rodeo. If your usual route takes you anywhere near Jacksonville Beach, be aware of ongoing road and utility work. They're still messing with water mains on 1st Street N and doing road improvements on 4th Street South. Also, FDOT's I-10 widening project means there have been detours and closures through today between I-295 and I-95, and around the I-95/I-295 North interchange. You'll also find various lane closures for road work on main arteries like Normandy Boulevard and US 301, some lasting through the end of the month.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Navigation:** Roads like Normandy Boulevard and various spots around Jacksonville Beach are under construction. Check FL511 or local news before you head out, especially for your longer runs, to avoid frustrating detours.

Good news is, there are no major races or events directly blocking popular running spots today. You can breathe easy knowing you won't get rerouted by a 5K you didn't sign up for. Just don't forget the Spartan Race is coming to Diamond D Ranch this weekend, so if you're planning a long, peaceful trail run out that way Saturday or Sunday, you might be sharing the mud with some very determined (and probably yelling) folks.

## The Verdict

It's a really nice day to get out and move your body. Just be smart about the air, and be ready to improvise on your route if you encounter construction. Happy running, folks.
