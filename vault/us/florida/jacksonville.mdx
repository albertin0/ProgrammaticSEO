Today’s looking like one of those Jacksonville mornings where you *think* it’s clear, but the air might have other plans for your lungs.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Early morning fog** is sticking around, making visibility a real issue on some routes. Don't be that person who learns about a pothole the hard way.
*   **"Moderate" air quality** is a bit of a misnomer if you've got sensitive lungs. That inhalable particulate matter (PM10 for those of you keeping score) is still hovering, and AccuWeather calls it "Poor" for sensitive groups.
*   **Construction is everywhere**, from major arterial roads to our beloved trails. Keep your head up, literally.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The temps are crisp at 15.3°C (roughly 60°F), and it *feels* like a perfect morning to hit the pavement or the dirt. But if you’re heading out before the sun fully burns off the mist, you’re playing a game of Russian roulette with visibility. The National Weather Service warned about patchy to areas of fog through late tonight and early Saturday, potentially dropping visibility to less than a half-mile in some areas. That means your usual early jog along the Southbank Riverwalk might be a bit more of a guessing game than a zen experience.

Then there's the air. The official AQI is sitting at 72, which is "Moderate." Sounds fine, right? Except the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). For us runners, particularly those with any kind of respiratory sensitivity, "moderate" can still mean irritation, especially on a longer effort. AccuWeather went ahead and just called it "Poor" for sensitive groups, which feels a lot more honest when you’re sucking wind trying to PR your segment. So, if your lungs usually complain, maybe dial it back or opt for an indoor session.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Dense fog advisory for early risers:** Visibility could be significantly reduced this morning, particularly in areas that saw rain yesterday. Be extra cautious, especially on road shoulders or multi-use paths near open fields or water where fog tends to linger.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of paths, our fair city is constantly under construction, and your routes might be impacted. Heckscher Drive (SR A1A) is getting a facelift and a new bike path connecting Huguenot Memorial Park to the Timucuan Trail. That's a long-term project expected to wrap up in early 2027, with daily construction during weekdays. And if you're further west, there's lane-blocking construction on 103rd Street between Monroe Smith and Samaritan Way.

For the mountain bikers and trail runners, take note: Trek Trails at Aterro Park is temporarily closed. SORBA Jax says it's for "compliance requirements," which sounds suspiciously like bureaucracy. All their *other* trails, like Hanna Park and Tillie Fowler, are still open. Also, for those who frequent the Jacksonville-Baldwin Rail Trail, expect ongoing paving work west from Hampton, which kicked off January 1st. It'll be great when it's done, but until then, watch your step (or your wheels).

<AlertBox type="info">
**Tip for Runners:** With PM10 as the dominant pollutant and general construction kicking up dust, consider swapping your normal running clothes for something that covers a bit more, or even a light buff, if you're particularly sensitive. Hydration helps too.

Here's a quick look at today's pollen situation, which, thankfully, is mostly a non-issue compared to everything else.

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Stay safe out there, Jacksonville. Don't let a "clear" morning fool you.
