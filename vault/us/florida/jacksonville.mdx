Alright, Jacksonville, let's talk about hitting the streets today. It's a decent day for a run, but don't get too comfy; there are always little annoyances hiding in the shadows.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are trying to play nice after a chilly start, heading into the low 70s, which is prime running weather for February.
*   Pollen counts are low, so your sinuses might actually give you a break for once.
*   Air quality is sitting in the "moderate" zone thanks to ozone and a side of potential wildfire smoke, so don't be shocked if things feel a little... spicy.
</BulletList>

## Today's Grind: The Good, The Bad, and The Smoggy

You woke up to a bit of a nip in the air, especially if you're inland, with some actual frost on the ground this morning. But, hey, it's Jacksonville in February, so that's already fading. We're looking at clear skies and a comfortable afternoon, topping out in the low 70s. Perfect for shedding those layers a few miles in.

Now, let's address the elephant in the room: your lungs. While pollen is being a relatively good citizen today, the Air Quality Index is hanging out at 62, firmly in the moderate category. The dominant pollutant is ozone, which for us runners means potential irritation, especially if you're pushing it. And here's the kicker: there's an "elevated fire danger" across parts of inland northeast Florida, and any lingering wildfire smoke is expected to drift northeast. So, that moderate AQI could easily feel worse depending on where you are and how the wind decides to play games. If you're out near the edges of Duval County, keep an eye (and nose) out.

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :---- | :----------------- |
| Low          | 62    | Ozone              |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert & Fire Danger:** With moderate AQI and elevated fire danger, sensitive groups might experience respiratory symptoms. Pay attention to how you feel, and consider scaling back your intensity if you start feeling any chest tightness or coughing.

## Construction Chaos Continues

If you're anywhere near **EverBank Stadium**, get ready for a mess. The "Stadium of the Future" construction is full steam ahead, and it's not just impacting future game days. This also means big changes for the 2026 Gate River Run, with the start/end lines and parking getting shuffled around. Expect parking to be a "pain for everybody," potentially pushing you a mile or more from the action. Even if you're just running through the area, expect detours and increased vehicle traffic from construction crews.

Beyond the stadium, Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) has lane closures happening all over the city. I-95, Butler Boulevard, Normandy Boulevard, and Blanding Boulevard are all seeing routine maintenance, utility work, or general road construction. Be aware, especially if your usual route involves any of these major arteries.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Plan Your Route (Especially Near EverBank):** If your run takes you near the sports complex, scope out your path beforehand. The ongoing stadium construction means unexpected detours and blocked access are the norm.

Finally, today at 1 PM, the city is installing the first marker for the Jacksonville Civil Rights Trail in front of Mt. Ararat Baptist Church. This is a significant event, and while it's not a race, expect some localized gatherings and potential foot traffic if your run takes you through the Durkeeville area.
