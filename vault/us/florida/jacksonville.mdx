Alright, Jacksonville, for once, you can mostly stop complaining about the weather and get your miles in.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Temperatures are hitting that sweet spot for a run – not too hot, not too cold.
*   Pollen counts are thankfully in the basement today, so your sinuses get a break.
*   Watch out for that sneaky ozone in the air, and there's still a whiff of wildfire smoke pushing northeast.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe (and the stuff trying to wreck it)

Let's get this out of the way: the temperature is pretty much perfect right now, hovering around 23.3°C (74°F) with clear skies. You won't be melting or freezing your ears off. Wind is a gentle southwest breeze at 5-15 mph, so no fighting a headwind the whole way down the **Jacksonville-Baldwin Rail Trail** today.

Now, for the stuff that tries to mess with your lungs:

| Pollutant         | Level       |
| :---------------- | :---------- |
| **Tree Pollen**   | None        |
| **Grass Pollen**  | None        |
| **Weed Pollen**   | None        |
| **Overall Pollen**| Low         |

Today’s pollen count is practically non-existent, which is a rare treat. Give thanks to whatever deity you pray to, because you won't be sniffling your way through your workout, at least not from local flora.

However, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a "Moderate" 70, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. What does that mean for you? Well, if you're like me and can run for days without a hiccup, you might barely notice. But if you're one of the "sensitive groups" – asthmatics, folks with respiratory issues, or those who just feel it in their chest – you might experience some minor symptoms with prolonged exposure.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Ozone and Lingering Smoke
While overall air quality is generally acceptable, sensitive individuals might want to dial back the intensity or duration of their outdoor workout due to moderate ozone levels. There's also some wildfire smoke wafting through Northeast Florida, mostly blowing northeast today, but it’s still out there. If you smell it, you’re breathing it, and that’s not good for anyone’s lungs.

## Navigating the Jax Gauntlet (aka Construction & Events)

Good news, runners and riders: I haven't seen any red flags for major trail-blocking events or closures directly impacting the likes of the Jacksonville-Baldwin Rail Trail *today*. That being said, if you're hitting any of our city's trails, always do a quick check, because Jacksonville has a habit of closing things down with about as much warning as a summer thunderstorm. Previous years have seen sections of the Jacksonville-Baldwin Rail Trail closed for CSX work, so it's always smart to be proactive.

Around the major arteries, though, it's a different story. The FDOT is still doing its thing with overnight detours on the I-95 and I-295 North Interchange projects, which are scheduled to wrap up *tonight*, Thursday, February 26. And if you're usually using the shoulders or adjacent paths near the Buckman Bridge, be aware of ongoing bridge maintenance on I-295 that's expected to last for a few more days. These are mainly car headaches, but if you cycle or run near these areas, stay vigilant.

### Beachfront Blues
If your workout involves the sand and sea, be aware that dune walkover replacements at Jacksonville Beach are ongoing until April 2026. This might mean some access points are blocked or detoured. Don't assume your usual path to the waves is clear.
</AlertBox>

Looking ahead, the World of Nations Celebration kicks off this weekend (Feb 28 - Mar 1) at Ford On Bay. So, while today is clear, if you plan to run Downtown or along the riverfront this weekend, expect crowds and potential detours. Plan accordingly, or embrace the human obstacle course.

Overall, it's a solid day to get out there and log some miles, but keep an eye on that moderate AQI and make smart choices for your lungs, especially if you're prone to respiratory drama.
