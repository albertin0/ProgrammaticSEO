Alright, Overland Park, if you've been waiting for a decent day to get outside, today's your shot – but don't get too comfortable.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **The Good:** Enjoy this unseasonably warm, clear February day while it lasts, because winter's trying to make a comeback tomorrow. We're talking highs near 73°F (23°C) and sunshine.
*   **The Meh:** Moderate AQI means you'll be breathing some inhalable particulate matter, which isn't ideal for those pushing hard. Your allergies might also be acting up with that moderate pollen count.
*   **The Ugly:** Key local trails are still shut down for long-term construction, and there are active roadworks that'll mess with your routes. Don't be "that guy" ignoring closure signs.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality & Allergies

Your lungs are getting a slight workout today just by existing in the current air. An AQI of 69 means it's moderate, and the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter. So, if you're prone to respiratory drama, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to indoors. Combine that with a moderate pollen level, and you might be sniffling through your strides.

| Pollen Type | Level      |
| :---------- | :--------- |
| Overall     | Moderate   |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality Alert:** With an AQI of 69 and particulate matter (&lt;10µm) hanging around, those with respiratory sensitivities might feel it. Monitor your breathing and consider shorter, less intense workouts. Your sinuses might also be a mess with moderate pollen.
</AlertBox>

### Weather Wisdom

Today is clear and unseasonably warm, a solid 8.5°C (47°F) that's heading up to a balmy 73°F (23°C) later, with a gentle east-southeast wind. Enjoy this little "false spring" because the forecast for Sunday is a rude awakening with rain and potential snow. So, if you're planning a long run, today's your window before things get slushy and cold again.

### Trail & Road Hazards: Mind the Closures, People!

This is where things get real. While the overnight I-35/U.S. 69 closures should be cleared by 6 AM this morning, that doesn't mean smooth sailing everywhere.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Major Trail Closures!** If your favorite running or biking spot is along the Tomahawk Creek Trail or Indian Creek Trail, tough luck. Both are **STILL CLOSED** due to the 69Express project. Tomahawk Creek Trail isn't expected to reopen until late spring/early summer, and Indian Creek Trail won't see daylight until the fall. Seriously, respect the barriers. They're there for a reason, and it's not to test your parkour skills. Find an alternative; there are plenty of other spots around, even if they're not your usual.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Ongoing Construction:** You'll still find work happening on the I-435 bridge between Renner Road and Shawnee Mission Parkway until June. Also, that Metcalf Avenue Multimodal Trail project, replacing a dinky sidewalk with a proper 10-foot wide path between 83rd and 87th Street, is still underway. Watch for equipment and detours if your route takes you through these areas.
</AlertBox>

In short: go out, enjoy the warmth, but be smart about where you go. Don't pull a hammy trying to hurdle a construction fence or breathe in a lungful of particulates just because the sun's out.
