It's a "check-your-route-twice-and-don't-assume-anything" kind of day for getting your workout in outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Pleasant Temps, Clear Skies:** At 7.6°C and clear, the weather is actually pretty decent for a late February run or ride. Your joints will thank you for the mild conditions after the colder stretches we've had. The long-range forecast even suggested February 2026 is running a bit warmer than average.
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** An AQI of 60 isn't terrible, but with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) as the dominant pollutant, anyone with sensitive lungs might notice it. It's not exactly crisp, fresh air out there.
*   **Construction Zone, Everywhere:** Overland Park is a city under construction. The 69Express project just wrapped up its new express toll lanes, which opened February 21st, but don't assume that means all related trail work is done. Furthermore, other major projects like the Quivira Road expansion (179th to 187th Street), which includes a multi-use trail, are slated to continue through late fall 2026. This means detours and closures, especially if you usually hit popular spots like the Indian Creek Trail or Tomahawk Creek Trail where work has previously impacted access.
*   **Rally in Downtown OP:** There's a "Free State Days Rally" happening at Thompson Park in Downtown Overland Park at 4:30 PM CST today. If your evening plans include running through that area, expect crowds and potential road blocks.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail Users Beware:** While many sections of our extensive trail system are likely clear, parts of Indian Creek Trail and Tomahawk Creek Trail were significantly impacted by the 69Express project, with reopening dates previously slated for late spring/fall 2025. It's 2026 now, so they *should* be open, but always check the latest status before heading out, especially if you're navigating near the US-69 corridor. Construction is ongoing in many parts of the city, so be prepared for unexpected detours on any route.

<AlertBox type="info">
**AQI Check:** An AQI of 60 means the air quality is moderate. For most people, this isn't a huge deal, but if you have respiratory issues, consider taking it a little easier or opting for an indoor workout if you're feeling it in your chest.

### Pollen Breakdown:
Today, the pollen count is doing us a solid.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Watch for Road Hazards:** With ongoing construction across Overland Park, from neighborhood street reconstructions starting this spring to the Quivira Road project, expect heavy equipment, uneven surfaces, and potential debris. Always be vigilant for construction vehicles and workers, especially on roads with temporary lane closures or detours.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today's conditions are mixed. The weather is inviting, but the pervasive construction and a planned rally mean you need to be smart about your route. Don't just lace up and go; take a few minutes to check for localized impacts on your usual stomping grounds, particularly around major thoroughfares and Downtown OP.
