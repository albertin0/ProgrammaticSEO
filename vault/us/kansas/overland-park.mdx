Alright, Overland Park, today looks deceptively good for getting out there, but don't be a hero.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  - That 16-degree Celsius air and clear sky? Blissful. Seriously, enjoy it, it's fleeting.
  - Pollen counts are practically non-existent, so your allergies can finally chill out.
  - However, our trails are a damn mess thanks to this recent freeze-thaw cycle. Your ankles are going to hate you if you're not careful.
</BulletList>

### Lungs & Joints Breakdown

The air quality, while not *terrible* at an AQI of 57 with inhalable particulate matter (PM10) being the dominant pollutant, isn't exactly sparkling either. If you've got even a hint of a sensitive respiratory system, AccuWeather thinks the air quality is "Poor" and "Unhealthy for sensitive groups" today, with an AQI up near 103. So, maybe don't push that tempo run too hard, especially if you're one of the lucky ones whose lungs decide to stage a protest at the slightest provocation.

| Pollutant Type                | Level        | Health Impact |
| :---------------------------- | :----------- | :------------ |
| **Pollen**                    | Low          | Minimal       |
| **AQI**                       | 57 (Moderate) | Sensitive groups may experience minor symptoms. |
| **Dominant Pollutant**        | PM10         | Respiratory irritation. |

### Watch Your Step (Seriously, Watch It)

Now, let's talk about those gorgeous, misleading trails. The good news is, Big Bull Creek Park is technically "Open." The bad news? Conditions are still "a little soft." "Soft" is trail-speak for "muddy death traps waiting to twist your ankle into a pretzel." And that's one of the *better* ones.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  Many local single-track trails like Blue River Park, Hidden Valley Park, and Hodge Park are either partially closed or fully closed due to severe mud, slick spots, and bike ruts from the freeze-thaw. Unless it's frozen solid (which it won't be at 16°C), you're risking damage to the trails AND your ligaments. Just stay off them. Seriously. Don't be "that person."
</AlertBox>

We had reports just two days ago of a slip and fall incident on West 151st Terrace that injured two people, with "uneven flooring or damaged surfaces" cited as a factor. That's your local reminder that even urban sidewalks can get sketchy.

### Construction Zone Navigation

If you're sticking to the roads or paved paths, be aware that Overland Park is basically one giant construction zone these days. KDOT has several short-term closures today on US-69, including the eastbound 135th Street entrance ramp and the northbound 119th Street on-ramp. The 69 Express project has already led to closures on "popular Overland Park trails." So, your usual route might be rerouted, riddled with orange cones, or just plain gone. Keep your head up and stay alert.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  KDOT construction on US-69 means potential detours, uneven surfaces, and traffic headaches, even if you're just trying to cross a bridge. Always scope out your route beforehand if you're planning a run near major roadways.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  Today's pleasant weather means you'll probably want to shed layers, but keep a windbreaker handy if you're out for a long one. And hydrate, even if it doesn't feel like summer. Your body still needs it.
</AlertBox>

Bottom line: Enjoy the glorious weather, but choose your terrain wisely unless you enjoy the company of an orthopedic surgeon.
