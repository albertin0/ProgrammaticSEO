Alright, KC, let's talk. Today's not terrible, but don't get cocky – there are still plenty of ways to mess up your workout if you're not paying attention.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lungs:** While pollen is thankfully low, the Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 70 with inhalable particulate matter floating around. It's not "stay indoors and panic" bad, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel it.
*   **Joints:** The weather is looking clear and actually pretty mild, with temps hitting the low 70s today. But don't let that fool you into thinking our trails are pristine. We've had recent rain and those charming freeze-thaw cycles mean mud, mud, and more mud.
*   **General Annoyances:** Construction season is eternal, and while it's mostly road-related, it always manages to snarl traffic around key areas, making your commute to that "perfect" running spot a headache.

### Today's Rundown

Today, February 28, 2026, Kansas City is seeing clear skies and a pleasant 7.8°C (46°F) this morning, warming up significantly to the low 70s (21-22°C) this afternoon. A nice day to be outside, right? Not so fast.

The Air Quality Index is hovering at a "Moderate" 70, with particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the primary culprit. For most folks, this means it's generally acceptable. But if you're prone to respiratory issues or you're planning a particularly intense session, consider sticking to shorter runs or keeping an eye on how you feel. It's not a smoke advisory, but it's not crisp mountain air either.

### Trail Treachery: Mud Edition

Listen up, trail runners: that lovely warming trend and recent rain are a recipe for sloppy, rutted trails. Just a couple of days ago, Wyandotte County Lake trails were closed specifically because of the "freeze thaw playing games with us and reports are trails are getting sloppy." And Blue River Park is reporting "partial" closures, warning you to turn around if you hit mud. Seriously, don't be *that* person who rips up the singletrack just because you want your miles. Not only can you twist an ankle in the muck, but you're damaging the trails for everyone else. If you leave ruts, you're doing it wrong. Stick to paved surfaces today, or be prepared to turn back if you encounter soft spots. Your ankles and the Urban Trail Co. volunteers will thank you.

### Eyes Up, Headphones Down for Commute Zones

While there are no major running-specific events today, always be aware of ongoing road construction. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) has various projects chugging along, including bridge repair on I-435 that's reducing lanes and diverting traffic. This is mostly for drivers, but if your route involves crossing busy streets or areas near these projects, stay alert. A stalled vehicle on I-435 near US 71 this morning just adds to the general chaos. It's not just about the pavement; it's about navigating the jungle around it.

Tonight, temperatures will drop back into the low 40s (5-6°C) and tomorrow brings a chance of rain and even some snow, so enjoy this mild day while it lasts – but be smart about where you put your feet.
