Today's weather might look deceivingly good, but don't let the sunshine fool you into a bad workout.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
-   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI is sitting at 61, mostly thanks to inhalable particulate matter. For most of us, it's just "meh," but if you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel it. Don't push it.
-   **Muddy Trails & Closures:** Forget your trail run ambitions. A lot of our beloved singletrack is a sloppy mess due to recent freeze-thaw cycles. Places like Hodge Park and Lexington Lake Park are explicitly closed, and plenty more are dodgy with soft spots. If you leave a rut, you're ruining it for everyone.
-   **Construction Chaos:** KDOT is busy, as usual. Expect detours and closures, especially if you're near major arteries like the K-32/Turner Diagonal Freeway where bridge work is ongoing, primarily overnight, but still impacting flow.

</BulletList>

Look, the sun's out and it's a balmy 15.7°C (around 60°F), which normally would be prime running weather. But if your usual route takes you anywhere near the **Indian Creek Trail**, you're out of luck. It's currently closed from Holmes & 99th to Lydia for a water services project. No amount of perfect weather is going to make that stretch runnable right now.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Muck!
Many local dirt trails are a casualty of the recent freeze-thaw. Urban Trail Co. reports are clear: if the trail is soft or muddy, stay off it. You're doing more harm than good. Check your trail status *before* you head out, or stick to paved routes. Seriously, it's not worth the ankle twist or the trail damage.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Watch Your Breath, Especially If You're Sensitive
While the pollen count is low, the Air Quality Index is still in the "moderate" range at 61. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (PM10). If you have asthma, COPD, or are otherwise sensitive, this isn't the day for maximal effort outside. Consider bringing your workout indoors, or at least keep it light.

### Pavement Pounding or Gym Time?
With trails being questionable and AQI being merely "moderate," today might be a good day for a road run, but be aware of traffic changes due to ongoing construction projects across the metro. Or, hit up one of our many 24/7 gyms like Planet Fitness in Kansas City (Speedway) or The Foundation Gyms locations where the air is filtered and the ground is consistently firm.
