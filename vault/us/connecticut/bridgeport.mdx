You eyeing the door after all that snow? Don't be a hero; your chiropractor doesn't need the extra business.

<BulletList>
*   AQI is in the moderate range, primarily thanks to ozone. Your lungs might feel it more than you think.
*   We just clawed our way out of a blizzard, and while main roads are "cleared" (a loose term in Bridgeport), residential streets and secondary paths are still a minefield of icy patches and compacted snow.
*   That "clear" sky now? It means anything that melted yesterday refroze into a lovely sheet of black ice overnight. Tread carefully, especially on shaded sections of trails and sidewalks.
</BulletList>

Alright, Bridgeport, let's talk turkey. The air's looking deceivingly crisp out there today, with the temp hitting a balmy 5°C (41°F) and the sun actually making an appearance. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's prime running weather. While the pollen count is blissfully low, giving your sinuses a break, your lungs are still dealing with a moderate Air Quality Index of 72, with ozone being the main culprit. That's not terrible for a casual stroll, but if you're pushing anything hard, you might notice it.

The real booby traps are underfoot. We just got hammered by a blizzard earlier this week, and while Mayor Ganim's crew did their best (or so they say, depending on who you ask in the South End), plenty of our beloved running spots are still sketchy. You know those charming side streets around the East Side or the paths winding through Seaside Park? They're probably still sporting a delightful mix of melting snow, refrozen slush, and good old-fashioned black ice. The National Weather Service even warned about black ice this morning from the overnight freeze, especially in southern Connecticut. So, unless you fancy a surprise slide or an ankle twist, stick to well-trafficked, clearly plowed areas. Or, better yet, hit the treadmill and save your PT copay.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Black Ice is Real (and Sneaky):** Even with temps above freezing now, shaded areas and untreated surfaces, especially along the waterfront trails, could still have treacherous black ice from overnight refreeze. Assume every wet-looking patch is ice.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress in Layers, Idiot:** It's 41°F, which feels great in the sun, but you're not running naked. Factor in the wind (even light wind makes 41°F feel colder) and remember that sweat can chill you quickly. Baselayer, mid-layer, wind-resistant outer. You know the drill.

### Today's Environmental Breakdown:

| Pollutant Category | Value |
| :----------------- | :---- |
| Pollen Level       | Low   |
| AQI                | 72    |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Uneven Surfaces & Hidden Potholes:** The snowmelt is revealing all the winter's sins. Watch out for newly exposed potholes and uneven ground on roads and trails. This is how you roll an ankle or worse.

Seriously, your joints are already tired from carrying your cynicism all day. Don't add a fall to the list. If you must run outside, slow it down, stick to major, well-salted sidewalks if possible, and maybe leave the trail running for when Mother Nature decides to be less of a jerk.
