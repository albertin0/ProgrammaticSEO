Today in Bridgeport, if you're hitting the pavement, you're going to need to be smarter than usual because winter's leftovers are still trying to trip you up.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   Watch your step: The blizzard from earlier this week left plenty of snow and ice behind, and cleanup has been "a mixed bag". Expect patchy ice and lingering snow, especially on sidewalks and less-traveled routes like sections of the Pequonnock River Trail.
*   Chill factor: With temperatures hovering just around freezing (0.7°C, but forecast lows hit -6°C today), any melting snow *will* refreeze, turning your morning jog into an unexpected ice ballet. Black ice is a real threat.
*   Air's just okay: Our AQI is sitting at a moderate 64, mainly due to fine particulate matter. If your lungs are sensitive, or you're pushing a hard effort, maybe opt for the treadmill today.

## The Icy Truth

Look, we just got dumped on, big time. That "blockbuster blizzard" earlier this week dropped 18-24 inches of the white stuff on us, and while the main roads might be passable, don't be fooled. Side streets, residential sidewalks, and especially our parks and trails are still dealing with the aftermath. I saw some spots yesterday with "snow-covered potholes" and plenty of melting slush that's just begging to become a new ice rink overnight.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Black Ice Alert!** With temperatures dipping below freezing after a day that might see some melt, black ice is a major concern. It’s nearly invisible and can turn a routine step into a full-blown face-plant. Assume every wet-looking patch could be ice, especially in shaded areas or on bridges.

### What to Expect Out There

Our city crews and contractors have been working their tails off, but clearing nearly two feet of snow takes time, and some areas are just not going to be pristine. Even Fairchild Wheeler Golf Course was closed earlier this week, and you can bet any natural surface trails are still a mess. That "light snow" we got yesterday probably didn't help, either.

And speaking of hazards that never seem to quit, let's not forget our old friend, construction. While not directly related to the weather, always be aware of your surroundings. The city always has projects going on, like the Canfield Park Development or the ongoing work in the South End around the Windward Apartments. Keep an eye out for equipment, detours, and general urban chaos, especially if you're running through those areas.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Chilly Temps & AQI Combo:** While the temperature (0.7°C / 33°F) doesn't scream "extreme cold," combined with a moderate AQI of 64 from fine particulate matter, it's not ideal for everyone. If you have respiratory issues, listen to your body and maybe keep your high-intensity efforts indoors. Otherwise, layer up, people. Frostbite on exposed skin isn't a badge of honor, it's just dumb.

**Footwear Matters:** This isn't the day for your minimalist racing flats. Break out the trail shoes with some grip, or at least your most aggressively-treaded trainers. You'll thank me when you're not sliding down Lafayette Boulevard.
