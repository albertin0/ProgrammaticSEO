Today's weather is *okay* for getting outside, but don't expect a smooth ride, folks.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are mild, which is a nice break, but that "moderate" AQI for ozone is the typical Louisville special – always something lingering in the air.
*   Persistent construction is still wrecking some prime running and cycling routes, so plan ahead or prepare for detours.
*   Pollen is low, so at least your nose isn't trying to escape your face.

## Workout Today? It's a "Meh" From Me.

Look, I'm all for getting those miles in, but let's be real about Louisville today, February 25, 2026. The mercury is sitting pretty at 11.4°C (that's about 53°F for the Fahrenheit crowd), and the sky is clear, which sounds delightful on paper. But dig a little deeper, and you'll find the usual Louisville caveats.

### Air Quality & Your Lungs

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 65, with ozone as our dominant pollutant. That's "moderate," which means it's generally acceptable, but if you're one of the folks with sensitive lungs – maybe you've got asthma, or you're just generally prone to feeling cruddy on bad air days – you might notice it. Let's not forget, Louisville often gets a big fat "F" for ozone pollution in those annual reports, so even on a "moderate" day, it's a constant battle for our air. Don't be surprised if your lungs feel a little more taxed than usual, especially if you're pushing the pace.

| Low          | 65  | Ozone              |

### Navigating the Obstacle Course: Construction & Closures

This is where things get really annoying for us local athletes. We've got a laundry list of ongoing and recent construction projects that are making some routes a nightmare.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Major Road Closures Still in Effect:** If your route typically takes you anywhere near **Mockingbird Valley Road** or **Edith Road** between River Road and Mellwood Avenue, be aware they are *fully closed* for I-71 overpass reconstruction. This isn't a quick fix either; expect this headache to last until July 2026. Seriously, plan an alternate route. Trying to weave through that mess on a bike is just asking for trouble.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Louisville Loop Detour:** Speaking of River Road, the **Ohio River Valley Section of the Louisville Loop** has a long-standing advisory against pedestrian use between Mile Markers 10.75-13.75 due to no pathway. Also, there's an active detour from Portland Wharf Park due to bank erosion. Stick to the designated detour signs if you're hitting the Loop.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Interstate Lane Closures:** For those who might drive to their starting point or run near major roads, expect alternating lane closures on I-64 East and West between mile points 1.5 and 2.0 (near the I-64/22nd Street and I-264 interchanges) from 9 AM to 3 PM, today through Friday, for bridge inspections. Overnight, the left lanes of I-64 East and West (mile markers 53-58) are also closed for drain cleaning. While not directly trail closures, this can impact access and create more localized traffic on surface streets.
</AlertBox>

Rudy Lane (between Brownsboro Road and Merrifield Road) is also still shut down until mid-April for water main work, another one to avoid if you're used to running or cycling that way.

### A Quick Word on Winds and Water

We had some pretty gusty winds yesterday, up to 30-35 mph, so keep an eye out for any lingering debris on trails or sidewalks. As for flooding, while there are no *active* major flood warnings for the Ohio River today, it's always something to be mindful of in Louisville between January and May. We've seen River Road sections close in past Februaries due to high water. With "Rain and snow at night" in the forecast, conditions could change quickly, so if it looks wet, stay out of low-lying areas.

## The Bottom Line

It's a decent temperature with low pollen, but the "moderate" ozone level is a buzzkill for your lungs, and the sheer amount of ongoing construction around key areas like Mockingbird Valley Road and parts of the Louisville Loop means you'll need to be flexible. If you're heading out, dress for mild weather, check your planned route for closures *before* you leave, and maybe stick to something less intense if your lungs tend to be finicky.
