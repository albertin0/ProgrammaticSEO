Alright, Louisville, today’s a mixed bag, so don't just roll out of bed and hit the pavement without a glance at what's happening.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  - That AQI is flirting with the "unhealthy for sensitive groups" line, which means your lungs might not love this long run.
  - Construction on some key corridors means detours and potential hazards are still the name of the game.
  - On the bright side, pollen is low, so your nose and eyes can relax for once.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe (or Try To)

Today, our air quality is sitting at a "Moderate" 72 AQI, with inhalable particulate matter being the main culprit. That's not terrible, but it's not great either, especially if you're pushing your pace. Moderate means it's generally acceptable, but some folks, particularly those with respiratory issues, might experience symptoms. So, if you're prone to a cough or have asthma, maybe keep that effort level a notch lower than usual. Don't be a hero; nobody wants an ER trip for bragging rights.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Moderate Air Quality Alert:** With an AQI of 72 and particulate matter dominating, sensitive groups (asthmatics, folks with lung conditions) should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Maybe skip that extra loop around Cherokee Park this afternoon.

## Construction: The Never-Ending Story

Just when you think you're clear, another orange cone pops up. Good news: Mayor Greenberg just announced the completion of the River Road Multi-Modal Project between 3rd and 7th Streets, which should make that section of the Louisville Loop a bit smoother for us. They even expanded the multi-use path, which is a win.

However, don't get too comfortable. The Louisville Water Company's Residual Line Project is still chugging along on other sections of River Road, expected to last through summer 2026. That means parts of our beloved River Road corridor can still be a headache for cyclists and runners. Keep your head up and stay aware of equipment and unexpected shifts.

And if your routes take you north, the I-264/U.S. 42 (Brownsboro Road) improvement project is in full swing, with daily/nightly lane closures expected. This is a huge project that’s going to be a nuisance for a while, so plan your routes accordingly if you're usually in that neck of the woods.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **River Road & Brownsboro Road Navigation:** While some River Road improvements are done, expect continued construction related to the Water Company project. If you're near Brownsboro Road and I-264, be ready for lane closures and potential traffic shifts. Your best bet is to check real-time traffic apps or stick to less affected routes.

## Pollen Report: The One Silver Lining

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Low          | N/A           |

Finally, some good news for your sinuses. Pollen levels are low today, so no need to drown yourself in allergy meds just to get a few miles in. Enjoy the clear breathing, because we all know this won't last forever.

## Weather Check

The forecast is showing clear skies and a cool 6.5°C (around 43°F), which is pretty decent for February. The wind might be a bit breezy, but nothing extreme, so dress in layers and you should be fine. Enjoy the decent weather while it lasts, because Louisville weather turns on a dime faster than a speed demon on the Big Four Bridge.
