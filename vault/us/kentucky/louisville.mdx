Alright, Louisville, let's talk about hitting the pavement today. It’s a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde situation out there, so tread carefully.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** Our AQI is sitting at 76, which is "Moderate," thanks to fine particulate matter. That's not terrible, but it's not ideal for sucking wind during a tempo run.
*   **Respiratory Illness Advisory:** The health department issued a formal advisory for a surge in seasonal respiratory illnesses (flu, RSV, pertussis) earlier this week. Breathing deeply into moderate quality air while there's a bug going around? Not a winning combo.
*   **Roads Are a Minefield (Still):** Just when you think a path is clear, Louisville Metro pulls a fast one. We've got significant closures and ongoing construction to navigate.
</BulletList>

Today's a classic Louisville paradox: decent temps, but a few too many asterisks to go full send. The mercury is at a comfortable 8.2°C and the skies are clear, which usually screams "get out there!" But hold your horses.

First, that AQI of 76 means we're dealing with "moderate" air quality, specifically from fine particulate matter. For most folks, it’s probably fine for a light jog. But if you're susceptible to respiratory issues, or if you're planning a harder effort, your lungs are going to be working overtime to filter that crud. Pair that with the recent health advisory about a surge in seasonal respiratory illnesses like the flu, RSV, and whooping cough, and you've got a recipe for a post-workout hacking cough you don't want.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up, Lungs!** With a Moderate AQI and an active respiratory illness advisory, consider scaling back intensity, especially if you have asthma or are prone to lung irritation. Maybe today's the day for a brisk walk, not a PR attempt.
</AlertBox>

Now for the fun part: dodging the orange cones. While Mayor Greenberg just announced the *completion* of some improvements on River Road (between 4th and 7th Streets) and the East Market Streetscape project, which *should* make things better for us runners and cyclists, don't let that fool you into thinking all is clear. There's still plenty of active chaos.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Major Road Closures to Avoid:**
*   **Mockingbird Valley Road and Edith Road** are completely shut down between River Road and Mellwood Avenue. This is for I-71 overpass reconstruction and isn't expected to open until July 31, 2026. If these are part of your usual route around the River Road area, plan a serious detour.
*   **Rudy Lane** is also completely closed to through traffic between Brownsboro Road and Merrifield Road until April 11, 2026, for a water main relocation. Another one to scratch off the list.
*   Expect **intermittent lane closures on Aiken Road** between Avoca Road and 13113 Aiken Road until April 1, 2026. Flagging operations will be in effect from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. for drainage work.
</AlertBox>

Don't forget the Louisville Water Company's Residual Line Project on River Road has been ongoing since March of last year and is expected to continue through summer 2026. While they say there won't be full closures, it's River Road, so expect some kind of disruption to your usual flow.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip:** With these closures, especially around Mockingbird Valley Road, you might find yourself on less familiar routes. Pay extra attention to traffic, and remember that drivers often aren't looking out for us. Bring your ID, a phone, and maybe some bright colors, just in case.
</AlertBox>

So, can you get your workout in? Yeah, probably. But be smart about it. Listen to your body regarding the air quality, and definitely scout out your route before you head out, or you'll be adding some unplanned mileage in frustration.
