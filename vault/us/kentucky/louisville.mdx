Alright, Louisville, you can actually hit the pavement or dirt today without freezing your backside off, but don't get *too* excited, because the city's still trying to rebuild itself around you.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is sitting at "Moderate" with ozone as the main culprit, so if your lungs usually throw a fit, be mindful.
*   Construction is, as always, a glorious, never-ending mess. Expect ongoing lane closures on major interstates and some key local roads.
*   Finally, some good news from the skies: the weather is clear and mild, making for a truly pleasant outdoor experience.
*   Pollen counts are mercifully low, meaning your nose gets a day off from its usual February melodrama.
*   A significant chunk of the Louisville Loop, specifically the Riverwalk section, remains closed due to erosion.

### Lungs & Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply (But It's Not Terrible)

Look, Louisville and decent air quality usually aren't mentioned in the same breath, are they? Today, your Air Quality Index (AQI) is at 80, which the powers-that-be label as "Moderate." The dominant pollutant is ozone, which is pretty standard for us. "Moderate" means it's generally acceptable, but if you're one of those folks with sensitive lungs – maybe you've got asthma or you're just generally prone to coughing up a lung after a hard effort – you might notice it. Don't be surprised if your older neighbors give you the side-eye for jogging when the air is anything but "Good." Historically, we've struggled with ozone, so 80 is almost a win.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Sensitive Lungs? Take It Easy.**
An AQI of 80 with ozone as the dominant pollutant means sensitive individuals (kids, older adults, those with respiratory issues) might experience some discomfort. Keep your effort level in check, especially if you're doing anything strenuous.

### Pollen Report: A Rare Win for Your Sinuses

| Pollen Type | Level |

| Overall     | Low   |

Yep, you read that right. The pollen fairies have given us a break. Don't get used to it; this is February in Kentucky, so it won't last. Enjoy it while it does.

### Joints & Trails: Mind the Urban Obstacle Course

While the temperature is a lovely 7.5°C (45.5°F) and the skies are clear, perfect for avoiding ice-induced face-plants, navigating Louisville right now is still an adventure. We're still dealing with the aftermath of winter, which means potholes are probably breeding faster than rabbits on some of our lesser-maintained roads. Watch your step if you're hitting the streets.

But the real headache for runners and cyclists is the ongoing construction and closures. I-64 is seeing lane closures, both near Hurstbourne Parkway for bridge work and in the downtown area for bridge inspections. I-71 is getting the widening treatment, which means daytime lane closures near Frankfort Avenue and Zorn Avenue. And then there are the smaller, but equally annoying, road closures like Rudy Lane for water main work, and Mockingbird Valley Road and Edith Road for I-71 overpass reconstruction.

The biggest bummer if you're a regular on the multi-use paths? The **Louisville Loop** is still compromised. The Riverwalk section, specifically near Portland Wharf Park, is closed because the riverbank decided to do some eroding. You'll find detours along Northwestern Parkway, but let's be real, a detour is rarely as good as the original route. Plan accordingly, or pick a different section of the Loop altogether.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Louisville Loop Detour Ahead!**
The Riverwalk section of the Louisville Loop, from Portland Wharf Park towards Shawnee Golf Course, is closed due to bank erosion. Detours are marked, but expect rerouting if this is part of your usual route.

**Always Check Your Route.**
With all the road and trail work, it's smarter to quickly check specific closures on LouisvilleKY.gov before you head out, especially if you're driving to a trail or running on city streets.

So, lace up, enjoy the unseasonably pleasant weather and low pollen, but keep your head on a swivel for traffic, potholes, and unexpected reroutes. It's Louisville, after all – nothing's ever completely straightforward.
