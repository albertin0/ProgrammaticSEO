Alright, Louisville, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the trails today.

Today's a pretty good day to get out there, especially if you plan your route smart and maybe keep your easy pace easy.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>

-   The air quality is hovering in that "moderate" zone, and while it's not terrible, that inhalable particulate matter could be a real drag on your lungs if you're pushing hard or have sensitivities. Don't ignore it.
-   Construction is still a constant companion in this city, and several road closures mean you need to stay alert and might need to audible your route.
-   Pollen is low, which is a rare win for those of us who usually spend spring runs looking like we just wrestled a ragweed patch.

## The Rundown for February 28, 2026

It's a clear morning in Louisville, currently sitting at a comfortable 8.2°C (47°F). The forecast says we're heading for some lovely sunshine, with temperatures climbing to a balmy 19°C (66°F) later today. So, weather-wise, it's feeling more like early spring than late winter, which is typical for this roller-coaster Kentucky February. No severe weather alerts currently, so you won't be dodging tornadoes or flash floods out there today, thank goodness.

But let's not get too comfortable. That clear sky doesn't mean perfectly clear air. The Air Quality Index is currently at 75, which slides us into the "Moderate" category. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm), or PM10. This isn't "Red Alert" status, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally cranky lungs, you might feel it more than usual. Think of it as running with a slight headwind in your airways. Louisville Metro's own Air Pollution Control Board has been talking about the need for better PM10 monitoring, so it's a known issue around here.

On the bright side, the pollen count is low. Go ahead and leave the industrial-strength antihistamines at home, you lucky duck.

### Navigating the Urban Maze (aka Louisville Roads)

Now, for the part that always gets my joints screaming: the state of our roads. Construction is a fact of life here, and this week is no different. You've got ongoing lane closures on Aiken Road for a drainage project until April, and a full shutdown of Rudy Lane between Brownsboro and Merrifield Roads for a water main relocation until mid-April. If you usually run or bike through those areas, you'll need a detour, probably one with less-than-ideal shoulders.

Closer to the river, the Louisville Water Company's Residual Line Project is still chugging along on River Road through the summer, though future "rightsizing" projects there are mostly about restriping and adding bike lanes, which sounds promising for connecting to the Louisville Loop. Just remember, "minimal impact" to traffic often means "maximum annoyance" for anyone on foot or bike. And don't forget the various pothole patching crews out there. After the recent snow, they're everywhere, and they'll create temporary lane closures without much warning.

<AlertBox type="warning">
    **AQI Moderate: Consider Your Lungs.** With PM10 as the dominant pollutant and an AQI of 75, sensitive individuals should ease up on intense outdoor efforts today. If you feel any irritation, cut your workout short.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
    **Rudy Lane & Aiken Road Closures.** Seriously, these aren't minor. Check your route before you head out, especially if you're training for longer distances and rely on specific roads. Surprises are for birthday parties, not long runs.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
    **Hydration, People.** Even when it's not scorching, you're still sweating. Grab some water before you go, especially with those pleasant temps making you forget it's still February. And watch for slick spots where construction has been, even if it's just wet dirt.
