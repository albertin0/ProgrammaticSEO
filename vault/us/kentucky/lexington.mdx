Today's a mixed bag for hitting the pavement in Lexington, so pick your route carefully and listen to your lungs.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Ozone's in the air:** While not terrible, our AQI is in the "moderate" range thanks to ozone, so if your lungs aren't feeling 100%, maybe stick to some indoor drills.
*   **Construction Zone Blues:** Major roadwork on Richmond Road and New Circle Road is an ongoing headache, and it's not letting up anytime soon.
*   **Cool, but Clear:** Temperatures are staying on the chilly side, but at least it's clear. No excuses about rain or snow (for today, anyway).
</BulletList>

## The Full Breakdown

### Air Quality

Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at 76, which the EPA kindly labels "Moderate." The dominant pollutant today is Ozone. What does that mean for you? It means the air quality is generally acceptable for most folks, but if you're sensitive – think asthma, bronchitis, or just generally finicky lungs – you might feel some minor to moderate irritation, especially with long-term exposure. So, if you're planning a long run or a tough bike ride, keep that in mind.

| Category             | Value | Dominant Pollutant |
| :------------------- | :---- | :----------------- |
| **AQI (Overall)**    | 76    | Ozone              |
| **Pollen Level**     | Low   | N/A                |

### Weather Check

It's 6.2°C (about 43°F) and clear out there, which sounds pretty decent. However, forecasts show today's high around 37°F and dipping to 19°F overnight, so don't let that "clear" condition fool you into thinking it's balmy. Bundle up, especially if you're out early or late. The National Weather Service even had a "Special Weather Statement" in effect this morning until 11 AM, though the details are vague – just another reason to stay alert.

| Category          | Value     | Condition |

| **Temperature**   | 6.2°C     | Clear     |

### Workout Hazards: The Real Talk

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Zone Chaos Continues:** If your route takes you anywhere near Richmond Road, especially heading south of Man O' War Boulevard towards Jacobson Park, expect disruptions. The Richmond Road Improvements project is still in full swing, meaning ongoing lane closures. Aphids Way is also completely shut down as part of this mess. A new shared-use path is supposedly coming, but right now, it's just a construction zone. Be vigilant and share the road.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**New Circle Road is a Mess, Too:** The widening project on New Circle Road (KY 4) between Leestown Road and Georgetown Road is a multi-year affair, with an estimated completion date of Summer 2027. If you use this corridor for cycling or running near the shoulder, be extra cautious. Expect active work zones and traffic shifts. Seriously, assume every driver is distracted.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for the Chill:** While it's clear, those temps mean you'll want layers. Think wicking base layers, a good mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget gloves and a hat, even if you feel tough. It’s still February in Kentucky, not some tropical paradise.
</AlertBox>

In short, today isn't the worst day to get outside, but it's not exactly a "set it and forget it" kind of day either. Pay attention to the air quality if you're sensitive, and for the love of all that is holy, watch out for traffic and construction workers on our major roads.
