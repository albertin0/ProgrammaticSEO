Look, it's not a garbage day, but it's not exactly prime running weather either.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Your lungs might feel a bit spicy today with that "moderate" AQI, thanks to ozone doing its thing.
*   It's a clear day, but don't let that 6.2°C temperature fool you – it's still February, so layer up unless you enjoy turning blue.
*   If your route includes the Kentucky Horse Park, prepare for a logistical nightmare around the area.

## Today's Lexington Run Report: Moderate Air, Mild Chill, and Wrestling Crowds

Alright, Lexington. You want to get out there today? It's doable, but don't just blindly hit the pavement. The air quality isn't doing us any favors, and there are a few other annoyances to navigate.

The big one for your lungs is that AQI sitting at 78, with ozone taking the lead as the dominant pollutant. "Moderate" means it's not ideal, especially if you're prone to respiratory issues or planning a high-intensity session. Don't be a hero; listen to your body. Or better yet, maybe dial back that sprint workout to a comfortable pace.

Temperature-wise, 6.2°C (about 43°F) and clear skies means it feels mild for late February, but it's still chilly enough to warrant proper layering. You'll warm up, sure, but those first few miles can be brutal if you're not dressed right. Think wicking base layer, a light long-sleeve, and maybe a vest or light jacket you can shed.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Don't Breathe Too Deeply
That moderate AQI is no joke, particularly if you're sensitive to air quality or planning a super hard workout. Consider cutting your effort level or opting for an indoor session if you feel any irritation.

### Local Roadblock: Horse Park Hustle

If your favorite long run takes you anywhere near the **Kentucky Horse Park**, be forewarned. Today, February 26th, the KHSAA State Wrestling Tournament is in full swing there. This means heavier than usual traffic on US 25 (Georgetown Road) and around the park entrances. Parking will be a gladiatorial event, so unless you're spectating, you might want to pick a different trailhead or adjust your timing. The trails *within* the park, like those around the scenic cross-country course, are probably fine, but getting there will be a pain.

### Kentucky Horse Park: Proceed with Caution
Expect a logistical nightmare getting in or out of the Kentucky Horse Park today. Parking will be a competitive sport, and surrounding roads will be backed up. Plan alternate routes or prepare for delays.

Roadwork around town is also a constant companion. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet had a "Special Weather Statement" active earlier this morning, though it's now expired. More significantly, there are scheduled lane closures on I-64 bridges for drain cleaning, running from 7 PM tonight through 6 AM tomorrow morning. If your evening or early morning run involves any part of I-64, be aware of crews and narrowed lanes. You might also encounter ongoing shoulder maintenance on I-75 in Fayette County. Basically, stay alert, even if you're not directly on the highway.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### I-64 Night Owls Beware
If your evening run takes you anywhere near I-64 bridges, be aware of overnight lane closures for drain cleaning from 7 PM tonight until 6 AM tomorrow. Use extreme caution or find an alternate route.
</AlertBox>

Pollen counts are low today, which is one less thing to worry about for now. So, if you're heading out, dress smart, acknowledge the air, and avoid the wrestling chaos if you can.
