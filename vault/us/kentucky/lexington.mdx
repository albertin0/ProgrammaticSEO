It's a mixed bag out there today, Lexington. Don't let that clear sky fool you entirely – a few hazards are lurking if you're not paying attention.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
-   **Flooding is confirmed on West Main Street.** Skip any routes through downtown that might put you near standing water.
-   Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 63, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not great for sustained, heavy breathing if you're sensitive.
-   Pollen levels are blissfully low, which is a win for all you allergy sufferers.
</BulletList>

## Today's Run Down

Look, I'm usually the first one to tell you to get out there, especially when the temps are a decent 11.1°C (that's about 52°F for those of us not on the metric system yet) and the sun's actually making an appearance. But today, February 25, 2026, you need to be smart about *where* you're pounding the pavement.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**DANGER: Flooding on West Main Street.**
Seriously, folks, a video posted today shows cars *splashing through floodwaters* on West Main. Unless you're training for an aquathlon, avoid this area. Floodwaters can hide potholes, debris, and even carry contaminants. Not worth the twisted ankle or impromptu foot fungus. Find another route, pronto.
</AlertBox>

While the overall fire risk is "Very Low" for Lexington, and smoke from past wildfires isn't an issue today, we're not entirely in the clear. The AQI is pushing into the moderate zone at 63, with Ozone doing most of the heavy lifting. If you've got asthma or any respiratory issues, consider scaling back your intensity or sticking to indoor workouts. You don't need to be sucking down extra ozone just because the sun's out.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| General     | Low   |

Good news on the pollen front – it's low. So at least your sinuses can breathe easy, even if your lungs are working a little harder with that moderate AQI.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**WARNING: Watch for Potholes.**
We've just come out of winter, and you know what that means: the Lexington streets are probably looking like a lunar landscape in some spots. An article from just last week mentioned how potholes are a "fact of life" after winter storms. Keep an eye on the road, especially on state-maintained thoroughfares like Nicholasville Road, and report any major craters to LexCall.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of trails, the Legacy Trail is generally a solid choice for a long run, offering 11 miles of paved path through horse country. However, keep your eyes peeled for any local alerts or event signage. LEXtoday shows a "Peace Rally" potentially happening on the Legacy Trail today. While not an official closure, it could mean crowds or temporary detours, especially if you're expecting a clear path. Always check local social media or park websites before heading out on popular routes.

**Local Tip: Check Before You Trek.**
Before you head out to your favorite park or trail, do a quick check on local social media groups or park department websites. This is especially true for popular spots like The Arboretum or Raven Run Nature Sanctuary. You never know when an unannounced event or a new patch of construction might pop up.

Stay safe out there, and don't let a sunny day override common sense. Your knees (and lungs) will thank you.
