It's February, Lexington, and today’s a mixed bag for hitting the pavement. While the mercury is finally playing nice, you’ve still got some urban obstacles to navigate.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   That 6.8°C (around 44°F) is practically a heatwave for late February, perfect for shedding a layer or two. But keep an eye out for lingering morning fog, especially near waterways or lower elevations, which Weather25.com mentioned as a possibility for Lexington today.
*   The air quality, though not terrible, is sitting at a moderate AQI of 72 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. For some of us, that's enough to feel a slight tickle in the lungs on longer efforts.
*   Ongoing road work, particularly around Richmond Road and Newtown Pike, means detours and uneven surfaces are still a real headache for your usual routes.
</BulletList>

## Environmental Breakdown:

| Pollutant          | Level  |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| General Tree Pollen | Low    |

### Air Quality Details:

The AQI of 72 means the air is "Moderate" today. This isn't red-alert territory, but if you're sensitive to ozone, or have any respiratory issues, you might notice it. Ozone is typically worse during the sunniest parts of the day, so an early morning or late evening run might be slightly better for your lungs.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip for Ozone:** Ozone concentrations often peak in the afternoon. If you're sensitive, try to get your workout in during the early morning or later evening when levels are typically lower.
</AlertBox>

## Local Hazards & Hotspots:

Look, I'm tired of saying it, but the cones are still out. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet has several large-scale projects underway that continue to impact our ability to move freely.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Chaos on Richmond Road:** Phase 1 construction continues on Richmond Road, particularly south of Man O' War Boulevard. This project includes improvements for shared-use paths and the entrance to **Jacobson Park**. Expect potential short-term lane closures (9 AM to 4 PM) and be prepared for changed road surfaces or confusing layouts if you're biking or running through there. Aphids Way, for example, is still fully closed as part of this.
</AlertBox>

And let's not forget the long-haul projects. The Newtown Pike (KY 922) widening project, which is supposed to bless us with improvements to the **Legacy Trail** by 2027, means you should always be vigilant around that corridor. Same goes for the New Circle Road projects. These aren't new in the last 24 hours, but they're *persistent* headaches affecting our outdoor fitness routines.

While the extreme cold warnings from Winter Storm Fern that plagued us earlier in February are thankfully gone with today's mild temperatures, don't get complacent. The city admitted "room for improvement" after that mess, so always be prepared for changing conditions, even if today looks clear.

Today isn't a bad day to get out there, especially with the decent temps, but keep your head on a swivel. Mind the moderate air quality, and definitely watch your step around any ongoing construction zones. Your knees (and lungs) will thank you.
