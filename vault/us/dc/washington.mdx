Alright, DC runners, let's cut to the chase: Today's one of those days where you'll spend more time dodging orange cones and wondering if you left the oven on than actually enjoying your run.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "Clear" weather forecast is a bit of a tease. While the actual temperature is a relatively mild 10.6°C (51°F), the wind chill is making it feel significantly colder, enough for an [AlertDC] Cold Alert to be in effect from 7 AM to 7 PM today, where it "will feel like 32F or colder." Bundle up, seriously.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 66 AQI, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. It's not red alert territory, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel it. Don't go trying to set any PRs today.
*   Construction is the unofficial state bird of DC, and it's wreaking havoc on our paths. Prepare for detours and unexpected reroutes.

## Trail Talk & Road Rambles

Look, if you're hitting the pavement, expect to weave a bit. The northbound lanes of **14th Street NW between L Street and Thomas Circle** are still a mess, closed through at least the end of this week due to a crumbling century-old sewer tunnel underneath. While pedestrian access is reportedly okay, and the L Street eastbound bike lane is open, you'll still be dealing with traffic diversions and general urban chaos. If you're running that stretch, keep your head on a swivel.

Out on the trails, our old friend **Rock Creek Park** continues its ongoing saga of closures. The southern end of the **Glover Archbold Trail** is still shut down because of "aerial hazards." What exactly is falling from the sky? Your guess is as good as mine, but best to steer clear unless you fancy an unexpected head injury. Also, starting Friday, February 27, at 8 PM, through March 2, the **Multi-Use Trail south of P Street NW** will be closed for DC Water work. If you're planning a longer weekend run, Beach Drive between Park Road NW and Blagden Avenue NW is getting hit with closures on February 28 and March 1 for hazard tree removal. It's always something.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Cold Alert in Effect:** Despite the seemingly mild temperature, a cold alert means the "feels like" temperature is at or below freezing. Dress in layers, cover exposed skin, and don't underestimate the bite of a DC February wind.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Plan Your Route (and Your Backup Route):** With ongoing construction and trail closures, especially around Rock Creek Park, always check official park alerts before you head out. A quick online search can save you a lot of frustration and unsafe detours onto busy roads.

No excuses on the pollen front today. If your allergies are acting up, blame your dust bunnies, not the great outdoors.
