Look, it's February 28th, and if you're hitting the pavement in DC today, you're either a glutton for chilly punishment or you just haven't seen the morning temperature. It's not the worst, but it's definitely not a day to be oblivious.

<BulletList>
*   **Chilly Start:** We're kicking off the day at a crisp 1.3°C (34°F). Sure, it'll warm up, possibly even hit the low 60s Fahrenheit later, but those early miles will be a shock if you're underdressed.
*   **Moderate Air, Microscopic Annoyances:** The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 76, primarily thanks to fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm). If your lungs are sensitive, you'll feel this, especially when pushing hard.
*   **Trail Maze:** Good luck navigating Rock Creek Park. There are closures everywhere, and if you don't check, you'll be adding unexpected detours to your mileage.
*   **Low Pollen:** At least your nose won't be streaming. Pollen is thankfully low today.
*   **Clear Skies:** No rain, no snow, just clear skies, which is a rare win in late February.

## Today's Local Rundown: More Than Just the Thermometer

Alright, let's talk about the real joy of running in DC: navigating the city's perpetual state of flux.

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

Your lungs aren't going to love you today if you're hammering out intervals or slogging through a long run, especially if you're one of the "sensitive groups" they always warn about. An AQI of 76 with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant means there's enough crud floating around to make a difference. This isn't a Code Orange, but it's not "fresh mountain air" either.

<AlertBox type="info">
**AQI Tip for the Easily Wheezed:** If you've got asthma or any respiratory sensitivities, consider toning down the intensity or opting for an indoor workout this morning. If you're out, stick to areas with less traffic where particulate matter might be slightly lower, though honestly, in DC, that's a tall order.

### Rock Creek Park: The Never-Ending Obstacle Course

Seriously, if you thought you had a clear path through Rock Creek Park, think again.
The **Multi-Use Trail south of P Street NW** is shut down from Friday evening until Monday morning for DC Water work. So is the **right southbound lane of Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway** in the same general area. This isn't just an inconvenience; it reroutes you onto potentially busier streets.

And if that wasn't enough, **Beach Drive between Park Road NW and Blagden Avenue NW** is closed *all day* today (8 am to 5 pm) for hazard tree removal. That's right, they're taking down trees, which means more detours, more cars, and more reasons to curse under your breath. The southern end of the **Glover Archbold Trail** is also under emergency closure due to "aerial hazards" – whatever that means. There's a posted detour, so follow it, don't try to be a hero and get yourself bonked by a falling branch.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**MAJOR TRAIL ALERT: Rock Creek Park is a minefield of closures today!** Double-check your route before heading out, especially if you planned on using the Multi-Use Trail south of P Street NW, Beach Drive (Park Road NW to Blagden Ave NW), or the southern Glover Archbold Trail. Expect significant detours.

### Downtown DC: Marching Orders

Heading near the Mall or downtown? Be aware. "The March 4 Democracy" event is happening today, February 28th, with thousands expected to gather near **777 Madison Drive NW** for a "mass rally and march." This isn't a small gathering, and while it's focused on civic engagement, it *will* mean increased pedestrian traffic and potential road closures that could disrupt any downtown running plans. Avoid that area if you're trying to hit your paces.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Downtown Disruption:** A large-scale rally and march ("The March 4 Democracy") is planned for today, centered around 777 Madison Drive NW. Expect significant pedestrian congestion and possible street closures in the surrounding downtown areas. Plan alternate routes if you're running near the Mall.
</AlertBox>

### Cold Weather Checklist: Still Winter, Folks

It's clear, which is great, but starting at 1.3°C means a good warm-up is crucial. Don't skip the dynamic stretches. Dress in layers, because that sun will make it feel warmer than it is, but once you stop or hit a shady patch, that chill will bite.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Dress in Layers:** While the day promises to warm up, morning temperatures are cold. Layers are your friend to avoid hypothermia and allow you to adjust as you go. Exposed skin can still be at risk in the early hours.
