Alright, let's talk about hitting the pavement or trails today, February 26, 2026.

It's a surprisingly decent day to get outside for a run, but keep your eyes and lungs open for local annoyances.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Pollen count is blessedly low, so your sinuses can take a break.
*   Temperatures are hovering around 10.4°C (50.7°F) with clear skies, which is basically prime running weather for late February in DC.
*   AQI is moderate with particulate matter, meaning you'll be breathing in a bit more than just crisp air.
*   Construction is still very much a thing, with ongoing impacts on sidewalks and major trail closures.

## The Rundown

Look, after the last week's weather rollercoaster, today's clear skies and mild temperatures are a gift. We dodged the worst of that Nor'easter that dumped snow on parts of the region over the weekend, and those frosty mornings are taking a brief hiatus. Enjoy it while it lasts, because March always has a few more tricks up its sleeve.

However, don't just blindly head out the door. Your lungs might have to work a little harder than usual. The Air Quality Index is currently sitting at a moderate 59, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. This isn't "stay indoors, apocalypse now" bad, but if you're sensitive or planning an intense, long-duration workout, you'll feel it. Think of it as your body doing some extra filtering. Keep that in mind, especially if you're prone to respiratory irritation.

### Construction Zone Headaches

<AlertBox type="warning">
DDOT has ongoing advisories. If your route takes you near **Nebraska Avenue NW** from Tenley Circle to Davenport Street, expect sidewalk repairs. That means detours, uneven surfaces, and generally annoying obstacles. Keep your head up and don't trust your usual rhythm through there.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
The frustrating news regarding the **Capital Crescent Trail** segment from Bethesda to Silver Spring remains: it's still closed for Purple Line construction. Don't hold your breath for it to magically reopen today; the tentative date for that section is Spring 2026. Planning on that route means navigating a less-than-ideal detour, so consider an alternative unless you're feeling adventurous (and patient).

## Pollen Outlook

| Pollen Level |
| :----------- |
| Low          |

The trees and grasses are still mostly dormant, so your seasonal allergies can stay on vacation for a bit longer. Breathe easy on this front.

## Stay Safe, DC

<AlertBox type="info">
With the moderate AQI, consider dialing back the intensity of your workout slightly if you're prone to lung irritation. Listen to your body – it's smarter than you think. And with various construction projects around the city, always assume a driver or cyclist hasn't seen you. Run defensively, especially around those marked (or unmarked) work zones.
