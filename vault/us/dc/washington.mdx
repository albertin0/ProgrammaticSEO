Look, today is a decent enough day to get out there, but you gotta be smart about where you're putting your feet and what you're breathing.

<LungsJointsScore score={6.5} />

<BulletList>
*   The temperature is mild for February, hovering around 9.6°C (that's pushing 49°F for you Fahrenheit fundamentalists), but don't be shocked if you hit some scattered showers this afternoon before things clear up tonight.
*   Air quality is sitting in the "moderate" zone at an AQI of 58, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the main culprit. While some real-time monitors might show higher readings, if you're usually sensitive, consider an indoor workout or keeping it easy.
*   Pollen is low, so your nose and eyes should get a break, which is a rare win around here.

## The Rundown on Hazards

Alright, let's talk about what's actually going to slow you down or trip you up on the pavement or trail.

### Rock Creek Park: A Minefield of Closures

Our beloved Rock Creek Park, while beautiful, is a bit of a maze right now, and not in the fun way. DC Water's Potomac River Tunnel Project is still chugging along. The riverside portion of the Rock Creek Trail between F Street NW and Virginia Avenue NW? Yeah, that's been closed for about four months and shows no signs of opening soon. You'll find detours pushing you onto the path closer to the Parkway itself.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Immediate Heads Up:** Starting *tomorrow*, Friday, February 27th, from 8 PM until March 2nd at 5 AM, a section of the Multi-Use Trail south of P Street NW will be temporarily closed for more DC Water work. Plan your weekend long runs accordingly, folks.
</AlertBox>

And if you thought that was it for Rock Creek, think again. The southern end of the Glover Archbold Trail remains under an emergency closure due to what they're calling "aerial hazards." So, no heroic detours there. Follow the posted signage or you'll be backtracking.

### Other Trail Troubles

The Capital Crescent Trail between Bethesda and Silver Spring is still a no-go for Purple Line light rail construction, with a tentative reopening of that segment sometime in Spring 2026. If you're planning a long ride or run, you'll need to use the designated detours, which, frankly, aren't always ideal.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Night Owls Beware:** From 5 PM to 4 AM, select park roads in Rock Creek Park might be temporarily closed for deer management operations through March 31, 2026. Best to stick to well-lit, open areas if you're out late, or just avoid the park roads during those times.

## Pollen Predicament

Good news on the sniffle front!

| Pollen Type | Level (Today) |
| :---------- | :------------ |
| Tree        | Low           |
| Grass       | Low           |
| Weed        | Low           |

## Final Word

It's a "get it done, but pay attention" kind of day. The moderate AQI means sensitive individuals should probably scale back the intensity. Everyone else, dress for potential light rain, keep an eye out for ongoing construction around Rock Creek Park, and remember that some major trails are still out of commission. Don't be that runner who ignores the signs and ends up staring at a "TRAIL CLOSED" barricade a mile into your route.
