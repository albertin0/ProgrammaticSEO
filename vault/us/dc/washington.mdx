Alright, DC, listen up. Today's one of those "looks nice, but don't be fooled" kind of days for getting your miles in.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
  <li>**Chilly, but clear:** That 5.8°C might look crisp on paper, but it's still cold enough to make your joints ache if you don't warm up right. Clear skies are a win, though, no denying that.</li>
  <li>**"Moderate" AQI is still crap:** Yeah, the Air Quality Index is at 61. It's not red-alert bad, but "Fine particulate matter" is the dominant pollutant. Don't pretend that stuff isn't getting into your lungs when you're sucking wind. It adds up.</li>
  <li>**Trail Roulette is still in play:** You know the drill. Construction and repairs mean your favorite routes are probably playing hide-and-seek. Don't go out assuming anything is open.</li>
</BulletList>

### Local Hazards & Your Knees (and Lungs)

That crisp, clear air sure beats yesterday's cold alert, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. While the pollen is mercifully low, your lungs still have to contend with that moderate AQI, thanks to fine particulate matter floating around. This isn't the day for maximal efforts if you're sensitive to that stuff. Take it easy.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Dress Warm, You Goofball!** 
  It’s 5.8°C, which is roughly 42 degrees Fahrenheit. That's not "light jacket" weather when you factor in wind chill and sweat. Layers, people, layers. Don't be the person shivering at the starting line.
</AlertBox>

Now, onto the real fun: actually finding somewhere to run without getting detoured into traffic. Rock Creek Park, bless its heart, is a minefield of closures right now. The Multi-Use Trail south of P Street NW will be closed starting *tomorrow night* (February 27th) for DC Water work, so you've got a small window today if that's your jam.

But here's the kicker: the southern end of the Glover Archbold Trail? Still shut down due to "aerial hazards." Aerial hazards! What are we, in a war zone? You'll be rerouted along Foxhall Road, 44th Street NW, and P Street NW if you try to hit that section. So much for a peaceful long run. And don't even think about running the riverside trail along the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway NW – that section's closed for roughly four months because of the Potomac River Tunnel Project. They are building a new trail closer to the river, but who knows when that's actually *finished* and open for business.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Glover Archbold and Rock Creek Trails are NOT Your Friend.**
  Seriously, if your route relies on the southern Glover Archbold or the riverside Rock Creek Trail near the Parkway, make a new plan. "Aerial hazards" and "four months of closure" are not things you want to mess with.
</AlertBox>

Beyond the major trails, keep an eye out for random construction. DDOT is doing citywide alley and pavement restoration, guardrail upgrades, and pavement marking work. These projects pop up everywhere and can cause temporary closures or restricted access. Your best bet is always to check the specific agency websites if you're hitting a new-to-you spot or are concerned about a particular stretch of road or path.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Before You Head Out:**
  Always check DDOT's project updates for your specific neighborhood. There's nothing worse than getting into your rhythm only to hit a "Road Closed" sign.
</AlertBox>

In short, it's a decent day for a run if you plan ahead and aren't afraid of a little chill. Just don't be shocked if your usual path is blocked by some new hole in the ground or, you know, "aerial hazards."
