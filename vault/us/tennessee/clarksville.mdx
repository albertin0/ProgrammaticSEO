If you're looking to hit the trails today, Clarksville, you've got a decent window, but keep an eye on what you're breathing.

<BulletList>
*   That "low pollen" forecast is a beautiful thing for your sinuses and airways. Get out there and enjoy not sniffling every five minutes.
*   Cool, clear air at 7.7°C (that's around 46°F for us Fahrenheit die-hards) means your joints won't be screaming from extreme heat or shivering in an ice bath. Layer up and you're golden.
*   The Clarksville Greenway is clear from its recent maintenance closures. So, if you've been itching to stretch your legs on that scenic route, today's your chance.

## The Air: A Mixed Bag

While the skies are clear, the air quality isn't perfect. We're sitting at an AQI of 62, which is in the "moderate" category. The main culprit? Inhalable particulate matter (PM10).

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality Alert:** An AQI of 62 with PM10 as the dominant pollutant means sensitive individuals might experience respiratory symptoms. If you have asthma, COPD, or other lung conditions, consider shortening your outdoor workout or taking it indoors today. Listen to your body – it's smarter than your Strava stats.

## What's Not Going to Trip You Up

Good news on the hazard front: I haven't seen any red flags pop up in the local news from the last 24 hours about major trail closures due to flooding, high winds, or unexpected events. You won't be rerouting your run around a surprise marathon or dodging fallen trees on the Clarksville Greenway today.

Construction is always a thing in a growing city like ours, and the Spring Creek Parkway Phase 2 project is still chugging along, aiming for completion in 2027. This is a massive undertaking to improve traffic flow between Trenton Road and Wilma Rudolph Boulevard, and it includes new sidewalks and a multimodal path. While it's not directly blocking current workout spots today, general awareness around active construction zones is always smart if your route takes you nearby. Just don't expect to run through fresh concrete, okay?

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

This "low" status is a welcome sight for anyone who's ever tried to run through a yellow haze of springtime misery. Enjoy it while it lasts; we all know how quickly that can change around here.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip:** Even with low pollen and decent temps, hydration is key. Don't let the cooler weather fool you into thinking you don't need to drink up. And since the air isn't pristine, maybe don't push that maximum effort interval session if you're prone to lung irritation. There's always tomorrow.
