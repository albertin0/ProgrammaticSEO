Alright, Clarksville, today's not the worst day to get out there, but you've got to keep your head on a swivel.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is clocking in at 71, which is "Moderate" thanks to fine particulate matter. It's not great, not terrible, but if your lungs are easily irritated, maybe take it a bit easier on those high-intensity intervals today.
*   **Utility Work & Road Obstructions:** Clarksville Gas & Water is doing valve replacement work on **Riverside Drive** from Barker Street to Cumberland Drive, starting at 6 AM today, February 26th, and expected to wrap by 2 PM. If your route takes you that way, expect detours or at least some distracted drivers. Also, remember those "heavy load" transports for the Airgas plant expansion? They're still moving intermittently through town for several weeks, with tomorrow (Feb 27th) being another scheduled day. These are massive trucks, so if you're out cycling or running on major thoroughfares, stay vigilant.
*   **Decent Temps, but Watch for Wetness:** The temperature is a mild 10.4°C (around 50°F), which is fantastic for running. But the National Weather Service is predicting a 40 percent chance of showers later this afternoon, primarily between 1 PM and 4 PM. Don't get caught out without a light shell if you're planning an afternoon sweat session.

### Clarksville Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Zone Awareness:** The Spring Creek Parkway Phase 2 construction is "well underway," involving tree clearing and grading. Even if you're not directly on the construction site, increased traffic in surrounding areas, dust, and general disruption are real for any outdoor activity near Trenton Road or Wilma Rudolph Boulevard. Be mindful of construction vehicles and potential dust kicking up.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Check Clarksville Parks & Rec for Trail Status:** While the major scheduled closure for the Clarksville Greenway (Mary's Oak to Pollard Road) was set to end February 12th for Phase 1, the project involves "multiple phases" with future dates "to be determined." Always double-check the Clarksville Parks & Recreation website for the most current closures before heading out for a long run or ride on the Greenway, especially if you're planning to hit areas around the Robert C. Hand Bridge.
