## Clarksville: Don't Breathe Too Deep, And Check Your Greenway Map

Look, it's not the *worst* day to get outside, but it's definitely not one for personal bests or long, leisurely strolls if you're prone to wheezing or hitting the pavement on autopilot.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** AQI is clocking in at 75, with ozone taking the lead. That's "moderate," which sounds fine until you realize it means if you've got asthma, lung issues, or you're just a kid or an older adult, you should probably dial back that long run. The rest of us? You *might* notice it if you push hard.
*   **Greenway's Still a Minefield of Cones:** Major sections of the Clarksville Greenway are still shut down for that Red River Pedestrian Bridge project. Don't plan on connecting from Kraft Street to the Water Treatment Plant without a detour that involves actual traffic. This isn't a new closure, but it's ongoing, and it's messing with our routes until at least March.
*   **Temps are Goldilocks:** At a comfortable 13.2°C (that's about 56°F for those still in Fahrenheit land) and clear skies, the weather itself is pretty fantastic for February in Tennessee. Enjoy it while it lasts, because we all know what's coming.
</BulletList>

Today's the kind of day where the clear skies are a cruel tease, promising a perfect workout until your lungs get a whiff of that ozone or you hit a "TRAIL CLOSED" sign for the third time.

### Air Quality Breakdown

| Pollutant          | Level | Impact for Sensitive Groups                                                                                                                              |
| :----------------- | :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AQI                | 75    | Acceptable for most; sensitive groups may experience minor to moderate symptoms from long-term exposure.                               |
| Dominant Pollutant | Ozone | Can aggravate existing respiratory diseases and lead to throat irritation, headaches, and chest pain.                                        |
| Pollen             | Low   | Good news for allergy sufferers.                                                                                                                         |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Clarksville Greenway Partial Closures (Ongoing through March 2026):** If your route involves the Clarksville Greenway, be aware that sections are *still* closed for the Red River Pedestrian Bridge construction. Specifically, the south side from the lift station to the Kraft Street bridge (near where the Greenway meets APSU's trail), and the north side from the Water Treatment Plant to the end of the trail at the river, are impacted. These are hard closures, meaning no sneaking through. Check the city's Parks & Rec site for specific detour info, or just plan an alternate route entirely. Seriously, don't be *that* person who ignores the signs.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Ozone and Your Lungs:** Even with a "moderate" AQI, ground-level ozone can be a real pain, especially if you're pushing it. It's not just about asthma; anyone can get throat irritation or chest pain with heavy exertion. Consider an indoor workout, or at least keep your outdoor efforts moderate today. Your future self (and lungs) will thank you.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today's workout vibe is "proceed with caution." The weather's inviting, but the air quality and those perpetual Greenway closures are significant enough to warrant some careful planning. Don't be surprised if your usual loop requires some creative navigation or a complete rethink.
