This ain't exactly prime running weather for Murfreesboro, so tread carefully if you're heading out.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   Heavy rainfall from yesterday means slick surfaces and potential standing water on trails. Don't be surprised if your shoes get soaked.
*   Air quality is sitting in the "Moderate" range due to ozone, so if your lungs aren't 100%, today might not be the day for that PR attempt.
*   Construction around the Stones River Greenway means some popular sections are completely off-limits. Get ready for detours.

## Murfreesboro Weather & Trail Conditions: February 26, 2026

Look, I love hitting the pavement or the dirt as much as the next runner, but today in Murfreesboro requires some common sense and a dose of reality. We just had a severe weather alert for heavy rain yesterday and overnight, with some spots expecting well over an inch of precipitation. While the skies might be clearing up a bit right now, trust me, the ground knows what happened. Those trails are going to be soggy, and slick leaves or mud patches are probably waiting to trip you up.

### Air Quality: Moderate with an Ozone Eye

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 77, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. For most of us, that's just a bit annoying, maybe a little scratch in the throat after a hard effort. But if you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity, or if your allergies are just generally cranky, this "Moderate" air quality isn't doing you any favors. It means you should probably dial back the intensity or shorten your route. Don't push it; it's not worth feeling like you swallowed sandpaper.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory:** An AQI of 77 (Moderate) means unusually sensitive people should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. Listen to your body and cut your workout short if you feel any symptoms.

### Trail Talk: Stones River Greenway Closed Section

Here's the kicker for anyone planning a long run on our beloved greenway. There's ongoing road and bridge work that has completely shut down a significant portion of the Stones River Greenway. Specifically, there's no through trail access between **Old Fort Park and the Cason Trailhead** due to work around Beasie Road. This isn't just a minor detour; it's a full closure. Don't waste your time heading there only to turn around. Find an alternate route, maybe stick to Old Fort Park's internal loops or check out Barfield Crescent Park if you're looking for some non-road miles.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Greenway Closure Alert:** Avoid the Stones River Greenway between Old Fort Park and Cason Trailhead. Road and bridge construction means this section is completely closed. Plan an alternate route!

### Weather & Road Conditions

Today's temperature is a mild 10.9°C (around 51.6°F) and it's clear, which sounds great on paper. However, with the heavy rain from yesterday, watch out for standing water, especially in underpasses or low-lying areas on the roads. Also, be mindful of ongoing construction projects across Murfreesboro. There are various lane closures for things like Google Fiber installation, Medical Center Parkway widening, and general annual paving work. While these might not directly impact trails, they can affect your drive to a trailhead or your planned street running routes.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Footing & Visibility:** Even if the rain has stopped, assume surfaces are slick. Wear appropriate footwear with good grip. With clearing skies, UV is moderate (3.4), so still slap on some sunscreen, folks.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are "Low" today. That's one less thing to worry about.

So, while it's not the absolute worst day, it's certainly not a "set it and forget it" kind of run. Be smart, be safe, and maybe just hit the treadmill if you're feeling less than stellar.
