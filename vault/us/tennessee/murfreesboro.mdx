Alright Murfreesboro, looks like Mother Nature is playing a cruel trick on us today. It *looks* perfect out there, but don't let the sunshine fool you completely.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **The Good News First:** Low pollen counts mean your allergies might actually give you a break for once. Enjoy that, because it's rare.
*   **The Catch:** Despite the clear skies and mild 15.4°C (60°F) temps, our Air Quality Index is hanging out at a "moderate" 76, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Perfect conditions for ozone to cook up, ironically.
*   **Trail Snafus:** While no major floods or wildfires are blocking our path (thank goodness), typical Murfreesboro construction and maintenance are still doing their thing.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality & Your Lungs

That "moderate" AQI might sound harmless, but for anyone with existing lung issues, or if you're planning a hard, long run, that ozone isn't your friend. It's an irritant, plain and simple. Think of it as an invisible haze designed to make your lungs work a little harder than they should.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Today's AQI of 76 (Ozone) means sensitive groups should probably take it easy. If you're generally healthy, just be mindful. If you feel any irritation, cut your workout short. This isn't the day to try for a PR on the Stones River Trail.
</AlertBox>

### Your Joints & Feet

The ground is looking good with no recent major downpours to turn our beloved greenways into mud pits. However, general trail conditions can always be a bit unpredictable this time of year.

<AlertBox type="info">
Keep an eye out, especially if you're heading to the Murfreesboro Greenway System. The Murfree Spring Wetlands Trail boardwalk is currently closed for repairs. Always check for local updates before you head out, as partial closures and damp spots can pop up. Also, Barfield Crescent's trails might still be partially open but potentially soggy from past storm damage.
</AlertBox>

### Construction Zone Headaches

Our city loves to build, which often means navigating around road construction even on your workout. This week, expect intermittent lane closures and new traffic patterns on Medical Center Parkway and around the Northfield Blvd/Rutherford Blvd corridor due to the adaptive signal project. Even Google Fiber installation is causing lane shifts on various local roads.

<AlertBox type="danger">
Be extra vigilant if your route takes you near major roads. Lane closures on Medical Center Parkway, for example, might push pedestrians and cyclists closer to traffic than usual. Stick to sidewalks where available, and assume drivers aren't looking out for you.

### Pollen Report

### Final Word

It's a beautiful day visually, but don't let the aesthetics overshadow the air quality. Get out there, but keep it smart, especially near traffic and construction, and listen to your lungs.
