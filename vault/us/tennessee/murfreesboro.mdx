Alright, Murfreesboro, today's one of those days where you really gotta pick your battles if you're heading outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Smoke 'em if you got 'em... or don't:** A prescribed burn is happening at Stones River National Battlefield, which means localized smoke and potential trail closures, especially around Fortress Rosecrans and Old Fort Park. That "moderate" AQI with particulate matter? It's about to get real in those areas.
*   **Construction is a constant:** From Google Fiber digging up every other residential street to ongoing work on Medical Center Parkway and SR 99 near Veterans Parkway, you're dodging traffic cones and trying not to trip over freshly laid asphalt.
*   **Crisp air, but layer up:** The clear skies are nice, but 5.2°C (41°F) is cold enough to make you regret that short-sleeve decision the second you step out.
</BulletList>

Look, I'm all for getting your miles in, but today requires some serious route planning and maybe a flexible attitude. That "clear" weather condition looks mighty tempting, but it's a bit of a trick. Stones River National Battlefield, a prime running spot for many of us, is conducting prescribed burns today across 40 acres at Fortress Rosecrans and Redoubt Brannan. While they're aiming for "best smoke management," fire means smoke, and smoke means particulate matter in the air. Our overall AQI is sitting at 65 with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant anyway, so adding actual smoke to the mix around Old Fort Park's trail system is just asking for a coughing fit. Some park areas will be closed. If you were planning a long run or a tough tempo effort near there, your lungs might not thank you.

## Pollen & Air Quality Breakdown

| Pollen Level | AQI Score | Dominant Pollutant                  | Temperature      | Weather Condition |
| :----------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------- |
| Low          | 65        | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) | 5.2°C (41.36°F) | Clear             |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Smoke Hazard: Stones River National Battlefield Prescribed Burns!**
Avoid running or intense exercise in or near Stones River National Battlefield, especially the Fortress Rosecrans and Redoubt Brannan areas, today. Prescribed burns are active, meaning localized smoke and increased particulate matter, which can exacerbate respiratory issues. Check park updates for specific closures before you go. Your lungs are not a smoke filter.

Beyond the smoke, it's business as usual with Murfreesboro's endless construction. You've got Google Fiber crews all over the place, meaning lane shifts and unexpected obstacles on your usual road routes Monday through Saturday, 9:00 AM – 3:00 PM. If you're cycling, expect the usual dodging of utility covers and distracted drivers. Medical Center Parkway is still a beast with intermittent lane closures and new traffic patterns, especially near Thompson Lane. If your commute or favorite running path takes you anywhere near there, stay alert. And don't even get me started on SR 99 from Veterans Parkway to Cason Lane – more lane closures for grading and drainage.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Chaos on Roads:**
Widespread construction for Google Fiber, Medical Center Parkway widening, and SR 99 work means lane closures and shifted traffic. Be extra vigilant if you're running or cycling on roads; assume drivers aren't paying attention. Consider trail alternatives that aren't currently on fire.

**Dress for the Chill:**
While the sun might be out, 5.2°C (41°F) is still brisk. Layer up to avoid a post-workout shiver. Think a good base layer, a light jacket, and definitely gloves and a hat, especially early in the day.
</AlertBox>

Today's the day for a treadmill, some indoor yoga, or maybe a short, easy walk in a clear-air neighborhood if you absolutely must be outside. Don't push it with that smoke, folks. Your body will thank you later.
