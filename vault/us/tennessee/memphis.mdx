Alright, Memphis, listen up. Today? It's a "maybe, but be smart" kind of day for your outdoor sweat session.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
- That 20.1C (68F) temperature and clear sky? *Chef's kiss* for getting outside.
- Pollen's playing nice, so your allergies should stay chill.
- But that AQI of 69 means you're breathing in fine particulate matter, which is hovering uncomfortably close to the "unhealthy for sensitive groups" territory. AccuWeather even called today's air quality "Poor" with warnings about difficulty breathing and throat irritation for sensitive individuals and with prolonged exposure for healthy ones.

## The Lowdown on Memphis's Outdoor Grind

Look, the weather gods finally gave us a break from the late January/early February winter mess that had schools shut down and roads sketchy. You can ditch the heavy layers and enjoy the mild temps. But before you lace up those HOKAs and hit the pavement or the trails, let's talk about what's actually out there trying to get you.

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

While the given AQI of 69 is technically "Moderate," it's on the higher side of moderate, with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. For anyone with asthma, COPD, or just a general aversion to feeling like you've smoked a pack after a mile, today's the day to take it down a notch. Prolonged or heavy exertion outside could leave you feeling it in your lungs. So, if your usual route includes a sprint up the hill on the Greenline near Overton Park, maybe scale back to a brisk walk or find an indoor option. Your airways will thank you.

### Trail Access & Construction Woes

Bad news for those who love the north end of the Wolf River Greenway. The parking lot at the north end of Mud Island is closed as of February 25th to make way for the Greenbelt Landing project construction. That means your usual access point might be a no-go, or at least a major detour. Plan ahead if that's your preferred starting line. The Wolf River Greenway is still undergoing development in phases, with about 14 miles currently open to the public out of a planned 26-mile route, so expect ongoing work in various sections of the trail over time.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory:** Your lungs are taking in fine particulate matter. If you're in a sensitive group, consider an indoor workout or reduce your time and intensity outdoors. Even healthy individuals might notice some irritation with prolonged, heavy exertion.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Mud Island Access Alert:** The parking lot at the north end of Mud Island is closed for construction. If you use this spot to access the Wolf River Greenway, plan for alternative parking and entry points.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**General Construction:** Expect general construction activity across West Tennessee, including Memphis, through at least March 4th. Keep an eye out for potential unexpected detours on roads and paths.

Overall, it's a mixed bag today, Memphis. Great weather, but the air quality demands a bit of respect, especially if you're sensitive. Listen to your body, check those detour signs, and don't push it too hard.
