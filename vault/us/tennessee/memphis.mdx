Alright, Memphis, today's a pretty decent day to get those miles in, but don't just blindly hit the pavement.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

## Why today is *mostly* the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Air's a mixed bag, but not a deal-breaker.** While the AQI is in the "moderate" zone at 74, and fine particulate matter is doing its thing, it's not "stay indoors" bad. Still, for folks sensitive to air quality, take note.
*   **Weather's playing nice.** At a comfortable 10°C (50°F) and clear skies, your joints and muscles are going to thank you. No ice, no blustery winds, just good ol' Memphis chill.
*   **Pollen's taking a break.** Low pollen levels mean your sinuses won't be staging a rebellion mid-run. Enjoy that clear breathing, allergy sufferers!
</BulletList>

## What's up with the air, really?

Look, we've got a moderate AQI with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. The City of Memphis might have reported "no dangerous levels" back in June 2025, but more recent news from February 16, 2026, pointed fingers at xAI's new gas turbines in South Memphis. Studies are suggesting these bad boys could significantly increase regional air pollution, specifically that pesky fine particulate matter, affecting communities all over West Tennessee and North Mississippi. So, while today's numbers are *moderate*, keep an eye on how you feel, especially if you're logging serious mileage or have any respiratory issues. This isn't just background noise; it's a growing concern that we, as runners breathing this air, should be aware of.

## Trail & Road Alerts:

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mud Island Greenbelt Access Restricted!
Heads up if your route takes you near the river: the parking lot at the north end of Mud Island is currently closed. This is for the ongoing Greenbelt Landing project construction. It might mess with your usual access points to the Greenbelt, so plan an alternate start or route if that's your jam. Don't waste your precious pre-workout energy looking for a non-existent parking spot.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Hydrate, even when it's cool.
Just because it's not scorching out doesn't mean you can skip the water. Even at 10°C, your body is working, and you're losing fluids. A little hydration goes a long way in keeping those muscles happy and cramp-free.
</AlertBox>

## Today's Pollen Breakdown:

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

No excuses on the allergy front today, folks.

So, get out there, enjoy the relatively clean air (for Memphis, anyway), and don't let a closed parking lot derail your workout. There are plenty of other spots to run in this city. Just be smart about it.
