Alright, Memphis runners, listen up! Today's a mixed bag out there; lovely running weather but keep an eye on your lungs and your feet.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is hitting "Moderate" for everyone, but AccuWeather is calling it "Poor" for sensitive groups due to ozone. Your lungs might feel it, especially if you push the pace.
*   Specific hazard alert: The walking trail at Marquette Park is reportedly crumbling in spots, with cracked concrete and uneven surfaces. Not ideal for a smooth stride, or really, for anyone wanting to stay upright.
*   Otherwise, the temperature is fantastic, and pollen is practically a non-issue. So, pick your spot carefully.

### Weather & Air Quality Rundown

We're sitting pretty at 16.3°C (that's about 61°F for the Fahrenheit folks), and the skies are clear right now. Enjoy it while it lasts, because the forecast hints at cloudier conditions and a chance of light rain kicking in tonight. Don't get caught out there without a light layer or a plan to finish before the drizzle starts.

Now, for the air you breathe: the Air Quality Index is hanging around 70, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. While 70 is generally considered moderate, some of our local forecasters are classifying today's air quality as "Poor," especially unhealthy for sensitive groups. If you have asthma, COPD, or just feel a bit wheezy on days like this, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to an indoor workout. Breathing in high levels of ozone can really mess with your respiratory system over time.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Tip for Ozone Days:** Ground-level ozone tends to peak in the afternoon and early evening. If you're sensitive, consider getting your run in earlier in the day if possible, or opting for routes with more tree cover which can sometimes offer a slight reprieve.

### Local Hazards & Your Safety

This is where it gets real, Memphis. Forget about those picturesque long runs through **Marquette Park** today. We've got reports from *today* that sections of the walking path there are crumbling – we're talking cracked concrete and uneven surfaces. Marcia Johnson, a resident who uses a walker, had a near-fall and is rightly concerned. The City of Memphis is supposedly going to "assess the situation," which sounds a lot like "don't hold your breath for immediate repairs." Avoid Marquette Park if you value your ankles and an un-sprained ego.

On a broader note, our streets, bless their hearts, continue to be a battlefield for pedestrians. Memphis has a grim reputation as one of the deadliest cities for walkers. Recent pedestrian accidents, some fatal, underscore the constant need for vigilance.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Immediate Hazard: Marquette Park Trails.** Seriously, reroute your plans. Uneven, cracked surfaces are an open invitation for a twisted ankle, a face-plant, or worse. Find another patch of pavement or grass.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Ongoing Hazard: Pedestrian Safety.** Always, always be aware. Don't assume drivers see you, even in broad daylight on the Greenline crossings or downtown. Wear bright colors, make eye contact, and leave the headphones at home, or at least keep the volume low enough to hear traffic. Your PR isn't worth a trip to the ER.
</AlertBox>

So, enjoy that cool air and low pollen, but stay smart about where you're putting your miles in.
