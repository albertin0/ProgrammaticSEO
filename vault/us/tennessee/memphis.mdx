Alright, Memphis, listen up. Today's one of those days where you *could* get outside, but you better be smart about it, especially if you're planning on pushing the pace.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "moderate" Air Quality Index (AQI 71, y'all) isn't just a number. It means there's enough fine particulate matter floating around to make your lungs work harder than they should. Not ideal for sustained, heavy breathing.
*   While the temps are sweet (a balmy 18.9°C and clear skies), we're still dealing with some regional air issues from that xAI plant down in Southaven. Those combustion turbines are kicking out pollutants that don't just magically stop at the state line, especially impacting areas like Whitehaven.
*   Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen is low. So at least your nose won't be staging a rebellion today.
</BulletList>

## The Air: Breathe Easy…ish

Let's be real, an AQI of 71 is sitting right on the fence of "eh, it's fine" and "maybe chill out a bit." The dominant pollutant being fine particulate matter means tiny airborne particles that can get deep into your lungs. If you've got asthma, COPD, or are just generally sensitive, you'll feel this more. It's not a red-alert, stay-inside kind of day, but it's definitely a "don't plan on setting any PRs" kind of day. Your lungs are working overtime to filter that crud.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Fine Particulate Matter Warning
An AQI of 71 with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant means sensitive groups should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Even for healthy individuals, listen to your body and cut your workout short if you feel any respiratory discomfort.

### Mud Island Greenbelt Access Alert
If your route usually starts or includes the northern end of the Wolf River Greenway near Mud Island, be aware: the parking lot up there is currently closed. They're prepping for the Greenbelt Landing project. You might need to find an alternative access point or adjust your mileage if that's usually your starting line. The Greenway is a gem, but construction always messes with flow.

### Hydration and Pace Check
Even with cool temps, good hydration is always key. And with that moderate air quality, consider dialing back your intensity. A brisk walk or a lighter jog might be smarter than an all-out sprint today. Your cardiovascular system will thank you.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

So, for once, your eyes and nose can stop watering, but your lungs still might be getting a workout they didn't ask for. Pick your poison, I guess.

Overall, it's a decent day for outdoor activity if you're mindful of that air quality. Stick to less strenuous activities if you're prone to respiratory issues, and everyone else, keep it moderate. No need to push it when your body's already doing extra work just to breathe.
