Today's a pretty decent day to get out there in Knoxville, especially if you snag that cool morning air before things really warm up, just keep an eye on your breathing if you're sensitive.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The morning is crisp and clear with temperatures starting around 5°C (41°F), warming up to a very pleasant 19°C (67°F) later in the day. No rain, just good ol' sunshine for your Friday.
*   Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 77, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the main culprit, so if your lungs are easily annoyed, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to shorter routes.
*   Construction is still a thing around town, especially on main arteries like Alcoa Highway and I-75. While these are mostly vehicle headaches, be mindful if your route skirts these areas.

## Knoxville Workout Outlook: February 28, 2026

Alright, Knoxville, let's talk about hitting the trails today. We're looking at a pretty solid day if you play it smart. The sun's out, the sky's clear, and we're finally shaking off some of that real winter chill. That 5°C start will feel brisk, but it's set to climb to a glorious 19°C this afternoon. Perfect for shedding layers as you go, which, let's be honest, is peak East Tennessee running.

But before you lace up and blast out the door, take a deep breath – literally. The Air Quality Index is clocking in at a moderate 77. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, which means little bits of stuff floating around that your lungs might not appreciate if you're really huffing and puffing.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Pollen is staying low, so at least your sneezes won't be competing with your gasps for air. Good news for those of us who usually look like we've run through a cloud of yellow dust this time of year.

<AlertBox type="warning">
For our friends with sensitive lungs or pre-existing respiratory issues, today's moderate AQI (77) due to particulate matter means you might want to ease up on prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. Don't push it; there's always tomorrow. Your lungs will thank you.

On the ground, watch out for the usual Knoxville traffic shenanigans. TDOT is still plugging away on various interstate projects. For example, rolling roadblocks and blasting activities were planned on I-75 North near Exit 108 (Merchants Drive) just yesterday, and lane closures continue on SR 131 Emory Road for utility work through today. Even if you're on a greenway, keep an ear out, especially if you're near one of these major arteries.

<AlertBox type="info">
If your usual run takes you anywhere near major roadways like Alcoa Highway (US 129/SR 115) or I-75, be aware of ongoing construction activities. While unlikely to close pedestrian paths, keep an eye out for potential traffic impacts, changing conditions, and workers present.

Speaking of trails, there's some exciting news for South Knoxville: work is officially underway on the new SoKno Rail Trail and Art Walk! This 3.8-mile recreation path will connect the Kerns Food Hall area all the way to Ijams Nature Center, transforming old rail lines into a multi-use path. While it's not fully open for your distance runs just yet, it's something to look forward to. For now, the existing trails around Ijams Nature Center remain your best bet for solid, uninterrupted mileage away from road construction. Just remember, Meads Quarry Lake and a nearby trail had a landslide closure last year - always check the City of Knoxville's trail closures page if you're heading deep into the Urban Wilderness.
