Today's a mixed bag, folks. You *can* get outside, but you better pick your path carefully unless you enjoy sloshing through mud or sucking down ozone.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air's a bit hazy for some:** Our AQI is clocking in at 71 with ozone as the main culprit. That's moderate, meaning if you've got asthma, hit those outdoor runs or rides a bit lighter, or maybe stick to the pavement. Your lungs will thank you.
*   **Trails are likely a swamp:** While the sun might be trying to peek out now, multiple reports show rain and high wind gusts hitting us this morning, and a flood advisory was active until 8:30 AM. This means the dirt trails, especially the singletrack, are going to be a muddy mess. The Appalachian Mountain Bike Club is calling many of them "unrideable conditions" as of yesterday.
*   **Some favorite spots are straight-up closed:** Don't even think about hitting the Flow trail at Ijams Nature Center; it's closed for maintenance through the end of February. Same goes for large sections of the Urban Wilderness, Baker Creek Preserve, Concord Park, and I.C. King Park. If it's a dirt trail, assume it's either closed or a mud pit.
</BulletList>

Look, the temperature at a pleasant 13.1°C (around 56°F) and low pollen levels sound great on paper, but if your workout involves actual dirt trails, you're looking at a slippery, boggy affair. Forget setting any PRs on those technical climbs today unless your goal is "most mud caked on my shoes."

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail Users Beware:** Many popular dirt trails in the Knoxville Urban Wilderness, including those around Ijams Nature Center, Baker Creek Preserve, Concord Park, and I.C. King Park, are officially closed or marked as having "unrideable conditions" due to recent wet weather and ongoing maintenance. Respect these closures. They're there for your safety and to prevent further damage to our trails. Nobody wants to be *that* person who tears up the trail for everyone else.

If you insist on getting your steps in outside, stick to the paved greenways like the Will Skelton Greenway. They're your best bet for avoiding the muck. Just keep an eye out for standing water in low spots, especially near the river, as we've had heavy rain recently.

For those sensitive to air quality, remember that AQI of 71 (moderate) with Ozone as the main pollutant isn't ideal for intense, prolonged outdoor exertion. If you find yourself coughing or feeling generally "off," take it inside, or at least dial back the intensity. There's no medal for pushing through something that actively harms your lungs.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

So, pollen isn't an issue, which is a win. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's an ideal outdoor day. It's clear that the ground conditions are still catching up after the recent wetness.

**Greenway Option:** If you're itching for a run or ride, the paved sections of the Neyland Drive Greenway or the Third Creek Greenway are likely clearer than the dirt trails. Just watch for puddles and be mindful of other users.
