It's a pretty good day to get outside, assuming you're not planning on breathing deeply near any heavy road construction.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is hovering in the moderate zone, mostly thanks to ground-level ozone, so if your lungs are finicky, take it easy.</li>
  <li>Temperatures are crisp and clear at 9.9°C, perfect for a long run without overheating or freezing your earlobes off.</li>
  <li>No major trail closures reported in the last 24 hours, but keep an eye out for ongoing construction around the city.</li>

## Why Today is (Mostly) Your Day

Today's a solid contender for an outdoor session, especially if you plan on hitting one of the less congested greenways early. With the mercury sitting at a comfortable 9.9°C and clear skies overhead, you won't be battling any surprise downpours or frosty conditions. That's a win in my book, as unpredictable Knoxville weather can turn a pleasant jog into an unplanned swim pretty fast.

However, let's talk about the air. Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 67, with ground-level ozone being the dominant pollutant. This puts us squarely in the "moderate" category. For most of us, that means "go ahead, but don't expect to set any personal bests on lung capacity today." If you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, you might feel a bit of irritation, so listen to your body and maybe scale back the intensity or duration of your workout. It's not a red-alert situation, but it's not sparkling fresh mountain air either. Some reports are even calling it "unhealthy for sensitive groups" at lower AQI levels, so stay mindful.

## Local Rundown: Mind the Machines

While no major trail-blocking events or widespread natural disasters have popped up in the last 24 hours, Knoxville's never short on road work. There are ongoing street resurfacing projects across Council Districts 1, 2, and 6, which means you might encounter crews and detours if your route involves a lot of city streets.

More specifically, for those who frequent **Fort Dickerson Park**, keep your head on a swivel. The Augusta Quarry Amenities Phase II Project is underway there, bringing roadway realignment, a new parking lot, and pedestrian plaza improvements. While these are long-term improvements, it means active construction zones. If you're running, biking, or even just walking your dog near that area, expect machinery, temporary pathways, and maybe some dust. It's not a "trail closed" situation, but it's definitely a "pay attention and stay safe" situation. Mobile lane closures on various interstates and major roads like Alcoa Highway also continue nightly, so if your workout involves running near those at night, exercise extreme caution.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Construction Alert:** Ongoing work at Fort Dickerson Park (Augusta Quarry) and various street resurfacing projects mean you could encounter heavy equipment and temporary detours. Stay alert and respect all signage.

  **AQI Tip:** With moderate ozone levels, consider adjusting your workout time to earlier in the morning when pollutant levels are typically lower, especially if you're sensitive.
