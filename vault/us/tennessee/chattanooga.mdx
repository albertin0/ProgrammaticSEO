If you're determined to get a workout in today, Chattanooga, you better come prepared and know your routes, because it's not exactly a free-and-clear kind of day.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering in the "moderate" zone, mainly thanks to fine particulate matter. Not exactly prime lung-busting conditions.
*   Rain is on the agenda for today, meaning those charming trails and paved paths are going to be slicker than usual.
*   Several key local arteries are still dealing with long-term closures and construction, so your usual loop might be a bust.
</BulletList>

## Environmental Rundown

Today's temperature is a mild 10.1°C (around 50°F) and it's clear *right now*, but don't let that fool you. The forecast says we're looking at rain throughout the day. Wet leaves and damp pavement are just begging for an ankle twist or a scraped knee. Tread carefully, especially if you're hitting any inclines or uneven terrain.

### Air Quality & Allergens

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at 59, which is considered "Moderate." The dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter. This means if you've got sensitive lungs, or you're planning a particularly intense session, you might feel it a bit more than usual. It's not *bad* enough to stay inside, but it's not perfectly crisp either.

Pollen, at least, is giving us a break.

## Local Workout Hazards

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Trail and Bridge Closures are Still a Thing

Seriously, Chattanooga, half our city's getting an upgrade, which is great for the future but a headache for runners *today*.
</AlertBox>

*   **Tennessee Riverwalk:** If your usual run takes you along the river, be aware. A significant chunk of the Riverwalk near the new Erlanger Park baseball stadium construction (think Chestnut Street Trailhead area) is shut down until April 2026. On top of that, a key pedestrian bridge closer to the Chattanooga Rowing Center is also out of commission for six months, having started in November 2025, for some much-needed safety fixes. No detours around these, so plan to turn around or find another route.
*   **Walnut Street Bridge:** Our iconic walking bridge is still getting its facelift. New decking, fresh paint, steel repairs – it's all happening. Don't expect to cross it on your run; it's slated to reopen in September 2026.
*   **South Chickamauga Creek Greenway:** Forget about a full end-to-end run here for a while. Approximately 1.5 miles between the Camp Jordan Access point and the Brainerd Road trailhead are closed until *summer 2027* for sewer work. You can still access other sections, but you'll hit a wall.
*   **Walden's Ridge Park:** If you're a mountain biker, hold off on the interior downhill trails at Walden's Ridge Park; they're currently CLOSED due to conditions. The multi-use exterior trails are still open, but check before you go.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Stay Agile, Stay Safe

With rain expected, every paved surface can be treacherous. Watch for puddles hiding potholes, slick leaves, and general debris washed onto paths. Adjust your pace, wear appropriate footwear, and if you're heading out before dawn or after dusk, make sure you're visible.
</AlertBox>

Always check your specific route before you head out, because getting halfway through a long run only to find a "Trail Closed" sign is a special kind of demoralizing.
