Alright Chattanooga, let's get real about stepping outside today.

Today's not a bad day to get your miles in, but don't be shocked if the official "clear skies" get a little less clear.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
-   Temperatures are sitting pretty at 18.1°C (64.6°F), which is practically a spring day for late February around here. Perfect for ditching the heavy layers.
-   Officially, the skies are clear, so enjoy that sunshine while it lasts. Just know some forecasts were muttering about rain and even a few t-storms earlier for today. Standard Chattanooga weather drama, really.
-   Pollen levels are showing "Low" from the official data, but a heads-up: local reports are indicating moderate tree pollen, particularly Elm, Cedar, and Juniper. So, if your nose is acting up, you know who to blame.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality & Your Lungs

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is showing 73, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. That technically falls into the "Moderate" category. However, some local bureaus are reporting "Fine Particles" as the highest pollutant for today, and AccuWeather is even calling today's AQI "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups." Confusing, I know. It's almost like they can't agree on how bad the air is.

| Pollutant Type     | Level          |
| :----------------- | :------------- |
| Overall AQI        | 73 (Moderate)  |
| Dominant Pollutant | Ozone          |
| Tree Pollen        | Low (Ambee)    |
| Tree Pollen (Local)| Moderate (Elm, Cedar, Juniper) |
| Fine Particles     | 12.5 µg/m3 |

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Don't Breathe Too Deeply, Folks: Ozone & Particle Alert

While the overall AQI of 73 is borderline "Moderate," the conflicting reports on dominant pollutants and some outlets calling it "Poor" means you should proceed with caution, especially if you're sensitive to air quality. Ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter can both cause respiratory irritation and aggravate existing conditions. Skip that hardcore interval session today if your lungs tend to complain.

### Local Hazards & Your Knees (and Everything Else)

Listen up, especially if you planned to hit the **Chattanooga Riverwalk**. A significant section near the new Lookouts stadium (South Broad district/Erlanger Park construction) is shut down for roughly nine months. This isn't news from yesterday, but it's an ongoing headache for runners and cyclists, and people are already worried about the safety of the detours, particularly the Chestnut Street option, which is choked with heavy truck traffic. Playing Frogger with an 18-wheeler isn't my idea of a good workout.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Riverwalk Closure: Proceed with Extreme Caution

A large portion of the Riverwalk is still closed for the stadium construction. If your route takes you through the South Broad district, be prepared for detours onto busy city streets. Specifically, the Chestnut Street detour has been flagged as high-risk due to heavy truck traffic. If you're running or cycling, consider an alternate route entirely or stick to sidewalks and stay hyper-vigilant. Don't be a hero trying to beat a dump truck.

And because Chattanooga always has a road or three torn up:

### Mind the Gaps: Construction Rundown

The westbound right lane of E 3rd Street is closed until March 4th for gas leak repairs. Also, TDOT's I-75/I-24 interchange reconstruction is still happening, with nightly lane closures on both interstates between 9 PM and 6 AM. If you're an early bird or a night owl, expect single-lane traffic in those areas. Check Chattanooga.gov for any fresh road closures before you head out.
