Today's a "take it easy or pay for it later" kind of day if you're planning on pushing it outside.

<BulletList>
*   That moderate pollen ain't no joke, folks. You might feel fine on your couch, but hit the Stringer's Ridge trails, and suddenly you're a snot factory.
*   AQI's creeping up there, mostly from ozone. If you've got even a hint of lung sensitivity, this is your body telling you to maybe stick to some indoor drills or keep the intensity way down.
*   Temperatures are cool but clear, which is nice if your lungs and sinuses aren't already working overtime.

## The Lowdown on Running Chatt This Friday

Look, I get it. The sun's out, it's not absolutely freezing, and your legs are itching to hit the pavement or the dirt. But before you lace up and blast out the door, let's talk about what's *actually* going on out there in Chattanooga today.

First, that "moderate" pollen level? That's code for "your allergies are about to get real friendly with your face." You might not feel it walking to the car, but once you start breathing hard on a run up Missionary Ridge, those pollen particles are going to go straight for your airways. Prepare for sniffles, itchy eyes, and maybe even a little wheezing if you're prone to it. Don't be that person hacking up a lung on the Riverwalk.

Then we've got the air quality. An AQI of 72 with ozone as the dominant pollutant is definitely leaning towards the "unhealthy for sensitive groups" side, even if it's not full-blown red alert. Ozone can irritate your respiratory system, making it harder to breathe deeply during exercise. If you're asthmatic, have COPD, or just get winded easily, today is not the day to set a PR on the Walnut Street Bridge. You'll feel it in your chest, and not in a good way.

The good news? No major freak storms, no reports of massive construction closing down the entire Chattanooga Bicycle Trail, and thankfully, no wildfire smoke from out west trying to choke us out. So, no *external* hazards beyond what our own bodies have to deal with today.

<AlertBox type="info">
If you absolutely HAVE to get your run in, consider an early morning outing before pollen really gets airborne and ozone levels climb. Or, stick to a shorter, lower-intensity workout.

### Today's Pollen Breakdown (Because you asked)

| Pollen Type | Level (Chattanooga) |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Tree        | Moderate            |
| Grass       | Low                 |
| Weed        | Low                 |

<AlertBox type="warning">
Remember your inhaler if you have asthma. Ozone and pollen together are a double-whammy for sensitive lungs. Don't risk an emergency for a few miles.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
Hydrate more than usual. Keeping your mucous membranes moist can help them deal with irritants a bit better.

*   AQI's creeping up there at 72, mostly from ozone. If you've got even a hint of lung sensitivity, this is your body telling you to maybe stick to some indoor drills or keep the intensity way down. AccuWeather even calls today "unhealthy for sensitive groups."
*   Temperatures are cool but clear at 6.6°C, which is nice if your lungs and sinuses aren't already working overtime.

However, remember that section of the Riverwalk between Riverfront Parkway and the new Erlanger Park stadium is still closed through April 2026 for construction. Don't plan on that shortcut.
