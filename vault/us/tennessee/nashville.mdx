Don't let those clear skies fool you into thinking it's a perfect day for an outdoor PR; Nashville's trails are still a bit of a mixed bag, to put it mildly.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lingering Wet & Wild:** Yesterday's heavy rain likely left many lower-lying sections of our greenways and natural trails damp, muddy, and potentially hiding debris. Even with the clearing skies, watch your footing.
*   **Construction & Closures Galore:** Multiple key routes are still impacted. The Stones River Greenway boardwalk is out of commission due to damage, and a significant chunk of the Whites Creek Greenway is closed for long-term TDOT road upgrades on Clarksville Highway. Don't plan on an uninterrupted long run there.
*   **Bridge Blues:** If your route involves downtown, be warned: the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge is under repair, meaning intermittent partial closures. Cyclists will need to dismount and walk through those sections, adding an unexpected break to your rhythm.
*   **Air Quality is Just 'Okay':** While pollen is low, the AQI is sitting at a moderate 74 with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. This means that for some of us with sensitive lungs, it might not feel as "clear" as it looks.

## Hazards & Hot Takes

Look, I'm all for getting out there, but you gotta be smart about it. That beautiful 52-degree weather after a day of rain can be deceptively tricky.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step on the Greenways:** Remember that winter storm from a few weeks back? Some Metro Parks facilities, including trails at the Warner Park Nature Center and parts of the Richland Creek Greenway, were closed for extensive damage with downed trees. While Edwin Warner Park has reopened, cleanup is *still* ongoing in places, and recent rain only exacerbates potential instability. Assume some sections are still rough, especially off the paved paths.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Solo Runners on Alert for Mill Creek Greenway:** This isn't just about slippery leaves anymore. There have been disturbing incidents on the Mill Creek Greenway, including a recent attack and a past murder. While Metro Parks has added some lights and cameras, recent events have residents on high alert. If you're heading out alone, especially in more secluded sections, keep your head on a swivel. Consider a buddy, or stick to more populated areas for a bit.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**AQI Check for the Sensitive:** "Moderate" air quality isn't "bad," but it's not "good" either, especially with particulate matter hanging around. If you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, listen to your body. Maybe stick to an indoor track or hit Fitness 1440 for some treadmill miles if you're feeling any chest tightness.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today's a day for caution, not crushing new trail records. Pick your routes wisely, be aware of your surroundings, and maybe double-check specific park websites before you head out, because "open" doesn't always mean "clear sailing."
