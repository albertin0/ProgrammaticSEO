Today? Forget the "clear" skies you *might* think you're seeing; grab a raincoat and watch where you step.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is sitting at 74 with ozone as the star pollutant. If your lungs are picky, they're going to complain. "Moderate" isn't a free pass for everyone.
*   Multiple greenways are dealing with long-term damage and new construction. Don't assume your usual route is open.
*   Despite what your phone might claim, heavy rain and dense drizzle are expected for most of the day, particularly if you're out early.
</BulletList>

## The Air: Breathe (Carefully)
The official word is an AQI of 74, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. For most folks, that's "acceptable." But if you've got sensitive lungs, or you're planning a hard effort, this is where you start feeling it. AccuWeather even called today's air quality "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups" in Nashville. Ozone isn't your friend when you're trying to set a PR, or even just enjoy a leisurely stroll. It's the kind of pollutant that can leave you feeling like you just ran through a smoker's lounge.

Good news on the pollen front – it's low. So at least your sneezes won't be from seasonal allergies today.

## On the Ground: Mud, Detours, and Watch Your Back

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail Closures and Construction Chaos:**
Expect disruptions. The Stones River Greenway boardwalk is still closed for damage. The Whites Creek Greenway has a bridge out for repairs, making sections inaccessible between Mullins Park and the Hartman Park Community Center. And don't even think about running the Percy Warner Park's Vaughns Gap Cross Country trail, it's closed thanks to lingering "Winter Storm Fern" issues. The Shelby Park Boardwalk on the Shelby Bottoms Greenway is also under repair. Always check with Metro Parks before you head out, because their website isn't always as fast as our gossip network.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Construction Everywhere:**
Nashville is a giant construction zone, and it's not slowing down. The Boring Company just got the green light to start digging the Music City Loop. They're setting up tunnel boring machine launch sites all over, including near the State Capitol and the airport. That means more heavy equipment, more noise, and more traffic headaches across the city.
</AlertBox>

And if you're looking to run near the new Nissan Stadium on the Cumberland River Greenway, be prepared for "detours due to some building on the upper side of downtown." They're literally reshaping the roadways around there, so your scenic river run might involve dodging construction vehicles and wondering if you're even on a path anymore.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Rain, Rain, Go Away... Or Don't, Because It's Here:**
Despite what the basic forecast *might* say, today is looking wet. Yesterday's severe weather alert for Davidson County called for heavy precipitation, and today's local forecast is predicting dense drizzle and significant rainfall throughout the morning. Those 13.3°C (56°F) temperatures might feel mild, but not when you're soaked to the bone.
</AlertBox>

Finally, while not a "new" hazard for today, the ongoing safety concerns on greenways like the Mill Creek Greenway are worth remembering. There have been calls for improved safety measures after recent incidents. Be aware of your surroundings, especially if you're out alone.
