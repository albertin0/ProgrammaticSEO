Alright, Nashville, don't even think about a PR today.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

### Why today is absolutely NOT the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Heavy Rain & Flood Risk:** We're under a Severe Weather Alert for Davidson County. Expect over 2.5 inches of heavy rain in the next 24 hours, with potential for localized flooding. That "clear" sky you *might* have seen this morning? It's a cruel joke; it's getting cloudy and wet.
*   **Lingering Trail Hazards:** Remember Winter Storm Fern? Many greenways and trails, like parts of the Richland Creek Greenway, are *still* dealing with downed trees and hazardous conditions from weeks ago. Adding heavy rain to already compromised paths is just asking for a trip to the ER for a sprained ankle.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** Our AQI is sitting at a "moderate" 67, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While not "dangerously" high, combined with high humidity from the rain, it's not exactly prime breathing air for a hard effort.

</BulletList>

Look, I get it. You want to get your miles in. But seriously, today is not the day to test your luck or your physical therapy deductible. Nashville's weather has been a real Jekyll and Hyde lately, and right now, Hyde is holding a bucket of water over our heads.

We just had a major winter storm a few weeks back, Winter Storm Fern, which knocked out power to hundreds of thousands and left a path of destruction, including plenty of downed trees across our beloved greenways. While some clear-up has happened, expecting everything to be pristine is delusional, especially with more heavy rain heading our way.

The Stones River Greenway boardwalk, for example, is currently closed due to damage. That's not just a suggestion; it's a "don't be an idiot" sign. Even if your favorite stretch isn't officially closed, assume standing water, slick leaves, and hidden debris are going to be your constant companions. You want to wade through that? Go for a walk in the Cumberland River, not a run on the greenway.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**FLOODING IS A REAL DANGER.** Do not attempt to run or bike through flooded areas on roads or trails. "Turn around, don't drown" isn't just for cars; it's for runners too. Standing water can hide severe hazards like washed-out sections, sharp debris, or even swift currents in low-lying areas. Davidson County is under a Severe Weather Alert, so take it seriously.
</AlertBox>

The temperature is mild, around 15-16°C (60-64°F) during the day, which would normally be decent for a run, but it's completely overshadowed by the torrential rain and subsequent risks. Your gear will be soaked in minutes, visibility will be garbage, and every puddle will be an unknown.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Visibility will be poor.** If you absolutely MUST get outside (and you really shouldn't for a workout today), wear bright, reflective gear. Assume no one can see you, especially drivers who are already dealing with crap weather.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Consider an indoor alternative.** Seriously, hit the treadmill, do some strength training, or finally clean out that garage. Your knees, lungs, and the emergency services will thank you. Tomorrow looks a bit better, with lighter rain and then clear skies, so maybe save your long run for later in the week.
