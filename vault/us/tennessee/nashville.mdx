Look, today's not a complete washout, but if you're planning a long run, you better have a backup plan that involves a treadmill or a really short, familiar loop.

<BulletList>
*   Yesterday's downpour means a lot of Nashville's favorite trails are still a mess, or outright closed. Think mud, slick spots, and downed trees. Your knees will thank you for being cautious.
*   Air quality is sitting in that "meh" zone, especially if your lungs are a bit finicky. Ozone is the main culprit today, so don't be surprised if your usual route feels a little heavier on the breathing.
*   On the bright side, at least we're not dealing with a seasonal allergy apocalypse. That's a small victory, I guess.

### Environmental Breakdown

| Pollutant          | Level  |

| Tree Pollen        | Low    |
| Grass Pollen       | Low    |
| Ragweed Pollen     | Low    |

### Air Quality Report

Our AQI is clocking in at 75 with Ozone being the dominant pollutant. Now, 75 isn't "hazardous," but AccuWeather is calling today's air quality "Poor" for sensitive groups, advising them to reduce time outside if they're experiencing symptoms like difficulty breathing or throat irritation. If you usually feel it when the air isn't perfectly crisp, today might be one of those days where your workout feels harder than it should. Keep an eye on any developing respiratory issues and don't push it.

### What's Actually Happening Out There

We've been through a pretty wet stretch, and the repercussions are still being felt on our local greenways and parks. Yesterday brought heavy rain to Davidson County, with up to 1.49 inches expected over 24 hours in some areas, and persistent damp conditions well into this morning. Even though the sky might be clearing up now, that water has to go somewhere, and it makes our trails treacherous.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Trail Closures & Damage!**
Several major greenways and parks are STILL dealing with significant damage from previous storms, including the recent "Winter Storm Fern" earlier this month. Don't assume your usual route is clear.
*   **Percy Warner Park:** Still closed due to downed trees blocking trails. This isn't just a "walk around it" situation; it's a "stay out" situation.
*   **Stones River Greenway:** The boardwalk is closed due to damage.
*   **Richland Creek Greenway:** Closed because a tree is blocking the path.
*   **Shelby Park Boardwalk:** The section near the observation deck on the Shelby Bottoms Greenway is shut down for repairs.
*   **Whites Creek Greenway:** A bridge here is also closed for repairs.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, folks, these aren't suggestions. These are *closures*. Going around them could put you at risk of falling, getting injured by unstable trees, or just generally making a mess of things for the folks trying to repair them.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Alert: Old Hickory Boulevard**
If you typically run or cycle on Old Hickory Boulevard near Harpeth Hills Golf Course, be aware that Metro Parks is upgrading the water line. This project started in January and involves digging and pipelaying, with brief single-lane closures expected. Keep an eye out for construction vehicles and be prepared for potential detours or delays.
</AlertBox>

So, if your workout plan involves hitting one of those specific spots, pivot. Find an indoor alternative, or stick to paved neighborhood sidewalks away from any large tree stands or construction zones. Be smart, stay safe, and maybe just embrace the spin bike today.
