Don't let that crisp air fool you; Nashville's always got something brewing to make your outdoor workout a little more... "authentic."

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>The air's decent, but not perfect. That "moderate" AQI of 63 means if you've got finicky lungs, you might feel the inhalable particulate matter doing its thing.</li>
  <li>Pollen's also in the "moderate" camp. So, while the skies are clear and it's a cool 7.3°C, your nose might still be having a party it didn't RSVP for.</li>
  <li>Construction is a constant state of being in this city, and a few of our greenways are still playing hard to get, either from old storm damage or ongoing projects.</li>

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

| Pollutant             | Level      | Health Impact                                                                    |
| :-------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Air Quality Index (AQI) | 63 (Moderate) | Acceptable for most; sensitive groups may experience minor to moderate symptoms. |
| Dominant Pollutant    | PM10       | Inhalable particulate matter.                                                              |
| Tree Pollen           | Moderate   | Allergy symptoms possible for sensitive individuals.                             |

### Construction & Trail Hazards

It's February 28th, and while the chill is mostly out of the air, Nashville's perpetual state of "growth" means you've got to keep your head on a swivel.

First off, our beloved greenways are still a bit of a patchwork quilt. The Stones River Greenway boardwalk is still out of commission from earlier damage, and if you were planning a scenic trot along the Shelby Bottoms Greenway, be advised the boardwalk near the observation deck is also closed for repairs. And remember that winter storm a few weeks back? Some of the trails, like those in Percy Warner Park and the Richland Creek Greenway, were hit with downed trees and ice. While it's been a bit, I wouldn't bet my last Gu packet that everything's perfectly clear yet. Assume there might still be lingering debris or slick spots in shaded areas.

Then there's the behemoth downtown. The new Titans Stadium construction is a massive undertaking on the East Bank, and while it's exciting for football fans, it means a lot of heavy machinery and shifting access points around that area. Speaking of digging, The Boring Company just got the green light to start tunneling *underneath* Nashville between downtown and the airport. While this is mostly sub-surface, expect surface-level staging and traffic diversions to become a headache near potential entry/exit points, possibly even towards West End. Keep an eye out for any new signs.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Watch for Lingering Winter Debris:** Even with clearer weather, expect possible downed branches or uneven surfaces on less-trafficked greenway sections, especially those previously impacted by ice and strong winds. Tread carefully.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Greenway Closures are Real:** Don't try to "run around" a closed sign on the Stones River or Shelby Bottoms boardwalks. They're closed for a reason, and you don't want to add a trip to the ER to your workout log.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **East Bank Commuters, Take Note:** While the new Greenway Connector ramp for the John Siegenthaler Pedestrian Bridge is still a "few years" out, expect more active construction around the East Bank as roadways and private projects develop. Always be aware of your surroundings and any temporary detours.
