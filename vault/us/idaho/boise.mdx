Another day, another chance to get out there, Boise. But let's be real, today's a mixed bag, so pick your poison wisely.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
-   Clear skies and mild temperatures make for a pleasant-looking day.
-   But don't let the sun fool you – the foothills are a mud pit, and the wind is ready to make you work for every step.
-   AQI is teetering on "meh" with moderate ozone levels.

### Weather & Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

Today in Boise, we've got a decent 8°C (that's around 47°F for the Fahrenheit folks) under clear skies. Sounds great, right? Except the "clear" comes with some "breezy" attached. Expect winds around 10 to 18 mph, with gusts pushing 20 to 30 mph. That's not exactly ideal for a chill long run, especially if you're hitting exposed areas. The good news is pollen is low, so your nose should be spared.

However, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a moderate 59, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. This means that while most people will be fine, if you're sensitive or have respiratory issues, you might feel it. Don't go setting any PRs if you're already feeling like you're sucking air.

Here's a quick look at what's floating around:

| Pollutant Category | Level |
| :----------------- | :---- |
| Tree Pollen        | Low   |
| Grass Pollen       | Low   |
| Weed Pollen        | Low   |
| Ozone              | Moderate |

**Pro Tip:** If you're hitting the pavement, try to stay on routes with less vehicle traffic to avoid extra ozone exposure, especially during peak commute times.

### Trail Conditions: Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud (Said No One Ever)

Alright, listen up, because this is the biggest hazard today: the Boise Foothills are a mess. Recent rain means low and mid-elevation trails are saturated and extremely prone to damage. Ridge to Rivers, bless their hearts, are straight-up telling us to avoid them to prevent both trail damage and potential injuries. We're talking deep, slick mud, especially on those clay-heavy sections in places like the Military Reserve and around Table Rock. Nobody wants to roll an ankle slipping in gooey muck or be "that person" leaving huge ruts.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**FOOTHILLS MUD ALERT:** Seriously, stay off the low and mid-elevation dirt trails in the Boise Foothills. You'll ruin the trails, probably your shoes, and potentially yourself. Stick to higher elevation trails with snow (like parts of Stack Rock) or paved alternatives.
</AlertBox>

Your best bet for dirt today is higher elevation, snow-covered trails, which are reportedly more stable, or you need to find an all-weather option. Otherwise, hit the pavement.

**Alternative Trails:** The Boise River Greenbelt is always a solid choice when the dirt trails are a no-go. It's paved, flat, and less susceptible to the muddy conditions currently plaguing the foothills.

### Construction & Closures: Watch Your Step

Heads up if you're near the Boise Avenue Bridge; construction work kicked off the week of February 11th. Crews are mostly working underneath the bridge for now, but expect temporary lane closures and traffic signals during the day. Delays are expected to be minimal, but stay alert in the area. Also, there's some trail improvement happening at Camel's Back Park, specifically an eroding section north of the chute that will be temporarily closed for new steps. Keep an eye out for signs and detours around there.

No major flooding alerts for the Boise River itself today, and no big events are blocking main running routes, which is a small win.

So, go get after it, but respect the conditions, especially if you're thinking about tackling those mucky foothills. Your lungs, joints, and fellow trail users will thank you.
