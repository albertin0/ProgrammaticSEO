Alright, Boise. February 28th, 2026. If you’re eyeing those foothills, maybe think twice, because today's a mixed bag of moderate air and muddy trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   That "moderate" AQI isn't going to win any awards for lung health. Particles in the air mean you'll be working a little harder than usual, and if you've got any respiratory issues, consider keeping it inside.
*   The Foothills are still a muddy mess. Ridge to Rivers has been telling us for days to stay off the low and mid-elevation trails to prevent damage, and frankly, a sprained ankle trying to navigate mud isn't a badge of honor. Stick to pavement or those higher, snowy trails if you're determined to get dirt on your shoes.
*   Construction continues to be the uninvited guest on some of our favorite routes, so be prepared for detours.
</BulletList>

## Environmental Breakdown: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

| Pollutant Category | Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant                  |
| :----------------- | :---- | :---- | :---------------------------------- |
| Air Quality        | Moderate| 62    | Inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) |
| Pollen             | Low   | N/A   | N/A                                 |

A temperature of 3°C and clear skies might look inviting, but don't be fooled. That AQI of 62, driven by inhalable particulate matter, means your lungs might not love your outdoor ambitions today. The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality has previously issued burn restrictions when the AQI hits 60 or above, indicating this level is definitely in the "proceed with caution" zone. Combine that with the crisp, cold air, and you're not doing your airways any favors with strenuous activity. Take it easy, especially if you're prone to asthma or other breathing difficulties.

## Trail Warnings & Local Gripes

### Boise Foothills & Camel's Back Park

<AlertBox type="warning">
    **Muddy Trail Advisory:** Low and mid-elevation trails in the Boise Foothills are likely still saturated and extremely prone to damage. Ridge to Rivers specifically advised avoiding these areas. If you're leaving tracks, turn around. Consider alternative routes like the Boise River Greenbelt or higher, snow-covered trails.
</AlertBox>

Let's be real, you know the drill after any significant moisture around here. Our beloved foothills turn into a greasy, boot-sucking nightmare. And guess what? They're still not recovered. A section of **Camel's Back Trail**, specifically near the main chute, is currently shut down for improvements. They're adding wooden steps to prevent erosion, which is great long-term, but right now, it just means you need to find another path. Don't be "that guy" ignoring the closure signs. Seriously, just don't.

### Boise River Greenbelt

While the Greenbelt is often your best bet when the foothills are a mess, even it has its issues today.

<AlertBox type="info">
    **Greenbelt Detours:** Several sections of the Boise River Greenbelt are undergoing repairs in 2026. Watch for temporary detours near Wood Duck Island and Barber Park, where path repairs are scheduled to run through May 15th.
</AlertBox>

There's construction planned for sections near Wood Duck Island and Barber Park to fix some of the more dilapidated pathways. You might encounter temporary closures or detours, so keep an eye out for signage. Also, that section near Expo Idaho, which reopened recently, still has temporary fencing up due to ongoing equipment in the area. Don't try to climb through it; it's there for a reason, likely to keep you from getting flattened by something large and metal.

### Other Closures

<AlertBox type="danger">
    **Basalt Trail #101 Closed:** In Oregon Trail Reserve, Basalt Trail #101 is temporarily closed due to wildfire mitigation work using heavy machinery. Masticators can kick up rocks and debris, so stay clear for your safety.
</AlertBox>

If you were planning on a more adventurous outing, several backcountry roads and trails in the broader Boise National Forest are still closed due to snow, avalanche danger, or construction. Unless you're specifically equipped for winter mountaineering and *know* the conditions, avoid those areas altogether.

My advice? Layer up for the cold, acknowledge that moderate AQI, and hit one of the designated all-weather trails if you must run outside. Or, you know, just use a treadmill like a normal person on a cold, slightly cruddy air day.

*Data grounded with KTVB and Ridge to Rivers from February 28, 2026.*
