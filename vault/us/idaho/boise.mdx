Alright, Boise. Today’s one of those days where Mother Nature seems to be actively trying to trip you, blow you over, or just get you muddy.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Winds are whipping:** Prepare for gusts up to a frankly ridiculous 65 mph, making any exposed run feel like a fight for survival.
*   **Boise Foothills are a quagmire:** Recent rain has turned low and mid-elevation trails into slippery, erosion-prone messes. Stay off them.
*   **Greenbelt has speed bumps (literal and figurative):** Expect construction zones, detours, and general inconvenience along sections of our beloved pathway.

## Today’s Rundown: Wind, Mud, and Moderate Air (Maybe)

Let’s talk about that wind. Starting today, through Monday, March 2, we’re looking at strong crosswinds, with potential gusts between 55 and 65 mph across southern Idaho, including Boise. That's not a "brisk breeze" for your run; that's "get blown into traffic" territory if you're not careful, especially on more exposed routes. If you're a high-profile vehicle (or a runner who just had too much coffee), consider yourself warned.

Then there are the Boise Foothills. After Tuesday and Wednesday's rain, Ridge to Rivers says our low and mid-elevation trails are "saturated and extremely prone to damage." Translation: If you run on them, you're not just risking a twisted ankle, you're actively contributing to erosion and trail degradation. Don't be that person. They're urging folks to avoid these sections for the next several days. Your best bet for the foothills is either sticking to higher elevation trails, where there might be snow (like Stack Rock Trail, if you're prepared for winter conditions) or paved alternatives like Mountain Cove Road, 8th Street Road, or Rocky Canyon Road. Oh, and that wildfire mitigation work near Oregon Trail Reserve? The Basalt Trail #101 is closed while they use heavy machinery. Don't wander in there hoping for a shortcut.

**DANGER: Extreme Wind Gusts Expected!** Boise could see gusts up to 55-65 mph today. Exposed areas will be extremely hazardous. Seriously, reconsider your outdoor plans if they involve battling a gale.

Air quality is a bit of a head-scratcher today. Your app might be telling you the Air Quality Index (AQI) is around 75, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. An AQI of 75 falls into the "Moderate" category, which means unusually sensitive people—think kids, older adults, or anyone with lung conditions like asthma—should probably dial back prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. However, the Idaho DEQ forecast for today shows "Green/Good" with an AQI around 38-42. If your personal monitor or app is showing 75, err on the side of caution. If it's the official DEQ number, you're mostly in the clear, but ozone can be sneaky.

The Boise River Greenbelt is usually a safe bet, but even it's got its issues. The City of Boise is doing Greenbelt improvement projects, with sections like the one near Wood Duck Island (from S. Temperance Way to E. Rivernest Court) undergoing repair and replacement until May 15. There's also ongoing construction at the Boise Avenue Bridge, which might cause some temporary lane closures during daytime work hours. Expect detours and be aware of your surroundings.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**WARNING: Muddy Foothills Trails!** Low and mid-elevation trails in the Boise Foothills are extremely muddy and susceptible to damage. Using them creates ruts and contributes to erosion. Stick to paved paths or higher, snow-covered trails.

Temperature-wise, it's a clear but cool 4.6°C. So layer up, you're not running in July.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Heads Up: Greenbelt Construction & Trail Closures.** Sections of the Boise River Greenbelt, particularly near Wood Duck Island and Barber Park, are under construction until mid-May. Expect detours. Also, the Basalt Trail #101 in Oregon Trail Reserve is closed for wildfire mitigation.
