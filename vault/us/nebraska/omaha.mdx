Alright, Omaha, it's a bit of a mixed bag out there today, so don't just blindly grab your gear and head out.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

### Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Air Quality is Meh for Some**: While not terrible, that AQI of 74 means moderate air quality, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. If your lungs are sensitive, you'll feel it.</li>
  <li>**It's Nippy, and It Feels Worse**: The air is clear, which is nice, but don't let the sunshine fool you. At 5.3°C (41.5°F), it's cold, and with the wind, it actually feels closer to 28°F (-2.2°C). Dress warmly, seriously.</li>
  <li>**Tranquility Park is Still a No-Go**: If you're a mountain biker or just love the trails on Omaha's west side, you're out of luck. Tranquility Park's singletrack is largely shut down until July 2027 for pipeline construction and soccer field work. Find another spot.</li>
  <li>**Construction Season is Forever**: Our fair city is always under construction, and today is no different. Expect lane restrictions and closures on major roads and around downtown. This isn't just for drivers; watch out if your route takes you near these zones.</li>
</BulletList>

The weather app might say "clear," and technically, it is right now, but that crisp winter air is a reminder that it's still February in Nebraska. That 5.3°C (41.5°F) thermometer reading is misleading; the wind chill makes it feel significantly colder, down to 28°F (-2.2°C). So, if you're hitting the pavement, layer up. Think gloves, hats, and windproof outer shells. Frostbite isn't a badge of honor, it's just poor planning.

Now, about that air. The AQI is sitting at 74 with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) as the main culprit. This falls into the "Moderate" category, which means for most of you iron-lunged folks, it's probably fine. However, if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally cranky lungs, you might want to consider an indoor session today. Some reports even suggest the air quality is "Poor" for sensitive groups, so listen to your body if you feel any irritation.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **MAJOR TRAIL CLOSURE ALERT**: If your workout plans involved the awesome singletrack at Tranquility Park, turn around. Most of the trails there are completely closed until July 2027. Yes, you read that right: 2027. Apparently, pipelines and soccer fields take precedence over our mental health. This is a significant blow to the local MTB and trail running community, so you'll need to scout out new routes for a while.

On the roads, it's business as usual: construction is everywhere. We've got bridge work on US-275 between South 79th Street and L Street, which means head-to-head traffic, and that never makes for a pleasant run or ride. Downtown, the Omaha Streetcar project is still chewing up Capitol Avenue, 8th Street, and Farnam Street, with various closures and lane restrictions. This doesn't just impact drivers; it means sidewalks and crosswalks can be affected, so stay alert, even on familiar routes. Always assume a driver isn't looking for you.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Cold Temps & Moderate AQI**: Bundle up! The wind chill is real today. Also, if you've got sensitive lungs, consider taking your workout indoors or shortening your outdoor session due to the moderate AQI. Your bronchial tubes will thank you.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Watch for Construction**: Road and sidewalk construction is ongoing across the city. Be extra vigilant for unexpected detours, uneven surfaces, and heavy equipment, especially around downtown and major thoroughfares. Plan your routes to avoid known construction zones.

Good news for allergy sufferers though: pollen levels are mercifully low. So at least you won't be snotting your way through your run, even if your lungs are working a bit harder.
