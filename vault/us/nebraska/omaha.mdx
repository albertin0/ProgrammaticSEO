Alright, Omaha, it's Thursday, and if you're thinking about hitting the pavement or trails, prepare to bundle up and navigate some serious detours.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **It's damn cold.** With temps hovering just below freezing, that "clear" sky is just going to make it feel colder on exposed skin.
*   **Your lungs will be fine, mostly.** Pollen is practically non-existent, but the air quality is still flirting with "meh" thanks to ozone.
*   **Construction is everywhere.** Seriously, it's a minefield of closures, especially downtown. Good luck with your usual routes.
*   **Your favorite trails are still gone.** Looking at you, Tranquility Park.

### Weather & Air Quality: Don't Skimp on Layers

Today is a classic Omaha late-winter day: clear but bitter. The thermometer is sitting at -0.8°C (around 30.5°F). While we're seeing some clear skies, that doesn't mean you get a pass on proper winter running gear. We've had a "Winter Storm Hernando" recently, and even if the immediate impact was "short-lived," there's a standing warning about potential icy patches and slick conditions, especially in shaded areas or on less-trafficked paths. Think about those low-lying areas along Papio Creek where ice likes to linger. Falling isn't just embarrassing; it's a trip to the ER for a broken wrist or ankle, and I've seen enough of those.

On the bright side for your allergies, pollen is thankfully low. Your lungs, however, might still get a bit of a workout beyond the cardio. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 74, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. This isn't "stay indoors" bad, but if you're particularly sensitive or have respiratory issues, you might feel it. Just something to keep in mind, especially during peak traffic times when that ozone can get a little thicker.

### Urban Obstacles: The Never-Ending Construction Saga

Let's talk about the real hazard out there: construction. It's a mess, folks. Downtown, the Omaha Streetcar project is in full swing, turning major arteries into obstacle courses. Capitol Avenue between 8th and 10th Streets is completely closed, and so is 8th Street between Douglas and Farnam, plus Farnam westbound from 10th to 8th. Forget your usual loop around the CHI Health Center—you'll be navigating detours and unexpected traffic patterns. I-480 is also dealing with lane closures near Capitol Avenue and bridge replacement work between South 28th and US-75/US-6, so if you're trying to get across town, expect delays and shifting lanes.

And it's not just downtown. You'll find lane restrictions on L Street from 78th to 67th, and 72nd Street from J to M. Southbound Ft. Crook Road at Capehart is completely closed for bridge work until further notice. Basically, assume any road you plan to run on has a 50/50 chance of being torn up or restricted.

#### Tranquility Park Trails are CLOSED!
If you're a mountain biker or trail runner who loves Tranquility Park, I've got bad news: about two-thirds of the trails are closed until **July 2027**. That's right, two more years. Pipelines, soccer fields, the works. Find a new stomping ground for a while, because this one's out of commission.

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Watch for Ice, Especially Early and Late
Even with clear skies, temperatures are below freezing. Keep an eye out for black ice on sidewalks, bridges, and shaded sections of paths. A fall on cold concrete is no joke.

#### Dress in Layers, Protect Your Extremities
When it's this cold, multiple thin layers are better than one thick one. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and warm socks. Seriously, frostbite isn't a badge of honor, it's a pain in the ass.
