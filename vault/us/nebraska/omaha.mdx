Don't let that clear sky fool you, Omaha. Today's a day for strategic layering and keeping a *very* keen eye on your surroundings, especially if you're hitting the pavement downtown.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is just "meh" for an outdoor workout:

<BulletList>
*   **Chilly Air, Moderate Breathing:** The temperature is hovering around 2.6°C (37°F), which means your lungs will feel that bite. Plus, with an AQI of 69 and inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, it's not exactly champagne air. While "Moderate" isn't "Unhealthy," combine it with cold and dust from endless construction, and your respiratory system might not thank you.
*   **Construction Zone Dodgeball:** If your route takes you anywhere near downtown or midtown, prepare for a frustrating game of "find the sidewalk." The Omaha Streetcar project continues to be a labyrinth of closed roads, detours, and general chaos. Forget smooth sailing; expect uneven surfaces, reduced pedestrian access, and traffic headaches, particularly around the CHI Health Center Omaha where Capitol Avenue, 8th Street, and Farnam Street are heavily impacted.
*   **Trail Limitations:** While not directly impacting paved running routes, mountain bikers are still facing extensive closures at Tranquility Park, with about two-thirds of the trails shut down until July 2027 for pipeline work and redesign. It's a reminder that even off-road, your options can be limited.

### Hazards to Watch For:

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Downtown Detours & Uneven Ground:** The streetcar construction is a beast. Expect closures on major downtown arteries like Capitol Avenue, 8th Street, and Farnam Street. Sidewalks might be unexpectedly closed, forcing you into detours or closer to vehicle traffic. Watch for loose gravel, sudden drops, and general construction debris. Keep your head up, not buried in your watch.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up Properly for the Chill:** Even with clear skies, 2.6°C (37°F) is cold enough to warrant serious layers. Think wicking base, insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget gloves, a hat, and thick socks. Cold muscles are unhappy muscles, and you don't want to explain frostnip to your significant other.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Keep an Eye on Air Quality, Especially Near Construction:** AQI 69 isn't terrible, but the dominant pollutant being particulate matter is something to consider, especially with the dust generated by jackhammers and other heavy equipment downtown. If you find yourself running through a particularly dusty zone, consider rerouting or doing your heavy breathing elsewhere.
</AlertBox>

It's clear, but it's cold and messy out there, folks. Pick your battles and your routes wisely.
