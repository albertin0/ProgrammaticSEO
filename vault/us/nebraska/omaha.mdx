Today's a mixed bag, Omaha. The weather wants you out, but the air and ground might have other ideas.

<LungsJointsScore score={6.5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is just "meh":** While not terrible, an AQI of 59 with inhalable particulate matter means your lungs might feel it if you're sensitive or going for a hard effort.
*   **Perfect running temps:** With temperatures around 10°C (50°F) and clear skies, your joints will thank you. No ice or snow to worry about today.
*   **Watch your step (and your route):** A giant sinkhole has swallowed up parts of 67th and Pacific, and downtown is a construction minefield.

## The Daily Rundown for Your Omaha Workout

Alright, runners, cyclists, and outdoor enthusiasts, let's talk about hitting the streets and trails of Omaha today, February 26, 2026. The good news first: it’s looking absolutely gorgeous outside. That 10°C (50°F) temperature is prime for getting miles in without freezing your fingers or overheating. The skies are clear, so no unexpected rain to deal with. Your joints, especially, will appreciate these mild conditions; no icy patches to contend with, which is a rare win for February in Nebraska.

However, let's not get too comfortable. Our beloved city always has a trick up its sleeve.

### Air Quality: Keep an Eye Out

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 59, which falls into the "moderate" category. The dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). What does that mean for you? For most folks, it's generally acceptable. But if you're prone to respiratory issues like asthma, or if you're planning a particularly strenuous or long workout, you might notice some irritation. This isn't wildfire smoke causing it, but rather localized particulates, possibly stirred up by the brisk breeze and ongoing construction.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate AQI Alert:** If you have respiratory sensitivities, consider dialing back your intensity or duration today. Those &lt;10µm particles can be a bother.
</AlertBox>

### Construction & Closures: The Eternal Omaha State

It wouldn't be Omaha without some road work, right? The downtown Streetcar project continues its relentless march, causing significant disruptions. Capitol Avenue between 8th and 10th Streets is shut down, as is 8th Street between Douglas and Farnam. Farnam Street westbound from 10th to 8th is also a no-go zone. If your usual route takes you anywhere near the CHI Health Center or the Old Market area, be prepared for detours and potential dust. This heavy machinery is definitely contributing to those PM10 levels in the air.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Downtown Detours:** Streetcar construction is still widespread. Plan your routes, especially around the Capitol Avenue and 8th/Farnam Street area. Sidewalks may be impacted, even if the streets are the main target.
</AlertBox>

### The Sinkhole Situation: A Literal Roadblock

Now, for the really exciting news: yesterday, a massive sinkhole opened up near **67th and Pacific streets**, swallowing two vehicles! Crews have closed off Pacific between 66th and 69th streets, and officials are warning that it could expand.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**MAJOR HAZARD: Sinkhole at 67th & Pacific!** Avoid the entire area between 66th and 69th streets on Pacific. This is not just a traffic headache; it's a genuine safety concern. Do NOT attempt to run or cycle through this area.
</AlertBox>

### The Takeaway

Today's a good day to be outside for the sheer pleasure of the weather, but stay aware of your surroundings and your body. Maybe stick to one of our fantastic multi-use trails further from the immediate downtown construction, and absolutely avoid 67th and Pacific unless you fancy a swim in a new, unplanned urban pond. Consider a lighter workout if your lungs are easily irritated by particulate matter.

Stay safe out there, Omaha.
