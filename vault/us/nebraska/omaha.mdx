Alright, Omaha. Today's one of those "could be worse, could be better" kind of days for getting your sweat on outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  *   The weather itself is playing nice: clear skies, a mild 7°C, and barely a whisper of wind. You won't be battling the elements today.
  *   Pollen levels are practically nonexistent, so your sinuses can relax for once.
  *   However, the air quality isn't exactly pristine, hovering in the "moderate" zone due to those lovely inhalable particulate matters floating around.
  *   And let's not forget the perpetual state of downtown demolition disguised as "progress."
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe

You know how sometimes the air just *feels* clean? Yeah, today's not quite that. Our AQI is sitting at 62, which officially puts us in the "Moderate" category. That means there's enough particulate matter (&lt;10µm and PM2.5) in the air to potentially mess with anyone who's got existing respiratory issues. Think about it – tiny bits of whatever floating into your lungs. Not ideal for a PR attempt.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **AQI Advisory for Sensitive Folks:** If you're prone to asthma, allergies, or just generally have lungs that complain, take it easy. Reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion, especially if you're trying to push it. Long-term exposure to these levels can aggravate heart and lung disease. The World Health Organization's annual limits are already being exceeded, so yeah, it's a thing.

## Weather Woes (or lack thereof)

The temperature is a respectable 7.3°C (around 45°F), feeling pretty comfortable out there. We've got clear skies, which is a blessing after some of the dreary winter days we've had. Wind is negligible, so no fighting a headwind for half your run today. Enjoy it, because the forecast hints at light snow by Saturday.

## Navigating the Omaha Obstacle Course

This is where things get interesting, or rather, irritating. If you're planning on hitting up some trails or running through downtown, be ready for detours and frustrations.

### Trail Troubles

**Tranquility Park Mountain Bike Trails are CLOSED.** And not just for a day. Two-thirds of those trails are shut down until **July 2027**. Yes, you read that right. The city decided soccer fields and burying pipelines were more important than some of Omaha's oldest and most loved singletrack. So, if Tranquility was your go-to, find a new spot for the next year and a half. Seriously, it's a whole thing, leaving local NICA teams scrambling.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Tranquility Park Closure: DO NOT ENTER.** Two-thirds of the mountain bike trails at Tranquility Park are closed until July 2027 for park redevelopment. Find another trail system.

### Downtown Detour Dilemmas

The Omaha Streetcar construction is still a giant headache, especially if you're trying to navigate downtown or midtown. Expect closures and traffic changes around the CHI Health Center area, specifically impacting Capitol Avenue between 8th and 10th Streets, 8th Street between Douglas and Farnam, and Farnam Street westbound from 10th to 8th. While the sidewalks along 10th Street by the CHI Health Center are supposedly open, assume congestion and keep your head on a swivel. This isn't just for drivers; pedestrians and runners trying to get through these areas will feel the pinch.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Streetcar Construction Chaos:** Downtown and midtown are a maze of closures due to the streetcar project. Be extra aware if running or cycling in these areas. Expect unexpected detours and slower going, particularly around Capitol Avenue, 8th Street, and Farnam Street near the CHI Health Center.

## The Bottom Line

Today's not a wash, but it's not perfectly clear sailing either. Enjoy the comfortable temps and lack of pollen, but be smart about the air quality and, for the love of all that is holy, pay attention to construction closures if you're downtown or looking for singletrack.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **General Tip:** Dress in layers for these transitional temps. A light long-sleeve base and a vest should do the trick. Stay hydrated, even if it doesn't feel super hot.
