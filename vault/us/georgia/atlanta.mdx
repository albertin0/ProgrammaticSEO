Alright, Atlanta, another day, another attempt to hit the pavement or the trails. Today's a pretty decent day to get out, but don't just blindly follow that perfect temperature forecast; there are still enough urban headaches out there to trip you up.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Mild temperatures mean you won't be freezing your fingers off or sweating through your eyeballs. Enjoy it while it lasts.
*   Pollen count is finally playing nice, so your lungs get a bit of a break today.
*   However, major road and trail construction is still a real pain, so know your route or risk adding some unexpected detours (and possibly some choice words) to your workout.
</BulletList>

### Weather & Air Quality

Let's be real, that "clear" forecast from earlier probably shifted. Expect mostly cloudy skies around the city today, with temperatures hovering comfortably around 16°C (60°F). You might even catch a slight chance of showers creeping in before 7 p.m., with gusty winds up to 20 mph after midnight, so if you're an evening runner, keep an eye on the sky.

Air quality is sitting at a moderate 67 AQI, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not great, but it's not awful either. Good news: there are no immediate local wildfire smoke alerts directly impacting Atlanta's air quality for today. While a brush fire is burning down in the Florida Everglades, and there was a high fire danger alert for North and Central Georgia on February 14th, neither seems to be sending smoke our way right now. Breathe easy, relatively speaking.

### Local Hazards & Trail Conditions

If you're planning a workout anywhere near Midtown, listen up. There's a 24-hour road closure on **10th Street NE between Crescent Ave. and Juniper St. NE** that's been in effect since yesterday for a major sewer repair. This isn't just for cars; it impacts foot and bike traffic too and is expected to last about a week. Plan your route around it, or risk becoming an involuntary spectator of sewer pipe replacement.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up, Midtown Commuters:** The 10th Street NE closure is a real one, impacting pedestrians and cyclists. Find alternate routes now to avoid frustration.
</AlertBox>

The **Atlanta BeltLine** continues its never-ending saga of construction. While they're pushing hard to get sections ready for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, don't expect smooth sailing everywhere. Specifically, parts of the Southside Trail (Segments 2+3 and 4+5) are seeing ongoing wall work, landscaping, and trail pouring. The United Avenue ramp on the Southside Trail, for instance, is still closed due to utility conflicts and might only open "likely February." The Northeast Trail "Gravel Rail Trail" is also fenced off for improvements with detours in place. Assume detours and uneven surfaces, especially if you haven't run a particular section in a while.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**BeltLine Beware:** Construction is active across multiple segments, particularly on the Southside Trail and Northeast Trail's "Gravel Rail Trail." Expect detours and be mindful of your footing on uneven surfaces. Check the official BeltLine updates before you head out.

If you're heading to **Piedmont Park**, you'll find the soccer fields closed for the season, and several restrooms are currently out of order for repairs, including those at the Dog Park, Legacy Fountain, and Noguchi Playscape. Always a good idea to check their site before you have to "go."

<AlertBox type="info">
**Piedmont Park Pointers:** While the main paths are open, many restrooms are closed for repair and soccer fields are closed for the season. Plan accordingly and check the Piedmont Park Conservancy's website for the most current closures.
</AlertBox>

Finally, if you live in Dunwoody, be aware of the localized flooding situation near Kingsley Lake due to a collapsed spillway. It's causing concerns about ground instability and potential sewer damage, though it's not a city-wide workout hazard, it's a very real problem for those living nearby.

Happy (and safe) running, Atlanta.
