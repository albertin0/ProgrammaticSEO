Alright, Atlanta, today's your day to get out there, mostly.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are absolutely mint for a run, walk, or anything in between. Seriously, 16.2°C and clear skies? That's what we live for.
*   Pollen count is finally playing nice. Low levels mean your sinuses won't be staging a rebellion midway through your Chattahoochee River run.
*   Watch out for that air, though. We're sitting at a Moderate AQI, thanks to ozone trying to crash our party. Also, construction is still chewing up parts of our beloved BeltLine.

## Today's Vibe: Spring Tease with a Side of Ozone

Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. After weeks of whatever indecisive garbage Mother Nature was throwing at us, today's 16.2°C (that's a glorious 61°F for you Celsius-challenged folks) and clear skies feel like a gift. The kind you don't return. Pair that with a blissful "Low" pollen count, and your lungs might actually thank you for once instead of trying to escape your chest. Your joints, meanwhile, will appreciate the mild air instead of having to warm up from a deep freeze.

| Common Atlanta Allergens | Level Today |
| :----------------------- | :---------- |
| Tree Pollen              | Low         |
| Grass Pollen             | Low         |
| Weed Pollen              | Low         |

### Air Quality: Moderate, Don't Be a Hero

Here's the rub: our Air Quality Index is currently clocking in at 79, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. That's squarely in the "Moderate" category. For most of us, it means you'll be fine. But if you're one of those sensitive types – we all know 'em, the ones who sniffle if a butterfly farts – you might notice it. Think twice before pushing a high-intensity interval session if you've got lung issues. Keep an eye on how you feel.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Warning: Moderate Ozone Levels**
With an AQI of 79 and ozone dominating, sensitive individuals (children, older adults, people with lung disease) should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Everyone else, you're likely good, but listen to your body.

## Atlanta BeltLine: Still a Construction Zone Marathon

If your go-to is the Atlanta BeltLine, prepare for the usual urban obstacle course. The Southside Trail, bless its future-paved heart, is still a hot mess of delays and ongoing work. Segments 4 and 5 had their opening bumped back because "recent rain and freezing temperatures" apparently don't play nice with concrete. So don't plan on connecting those dots seamlessly just yet; you'll hit a wall, literally.

Segments 2 and 3 are also deep in it, with "ongoing brownfield cleanup" near Milton Avenue and D.H. Stanton Park. They're still pouring concrete, with promises of completion by March for most, and May for that Milton Avenue stretch. And if you're up on the Northwest Trail Segment 1, don't expect a smooth ride over Peachtree Creek anytime soon – that bridge work is dragging into 2027 or even 2028.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**BeltLine Closures & Delays: Southside Still Under Siege**
Portions of the Southside Trail (Segments 2, 3, 4, and 5) remain under active construction with significant delays and closures. Expect detours, unfinished sections, and possibly heavy equipment, especially around Milton Avenue and D.H. Stanton Park. Trespassing on active construction sites is prohibited and dangerous.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip: Know Before You Go**
Always check the official Atlanta BeltLine website for the latest construction updates and detour maps before you head out. Don't assume your usual route is clear, especially if you're hitting any of the newer, unfinished sections. Better yet, embrace a different park or trail today, like Piedmont Park or the trails around Stone Mountain, if you need uninterrupted miles.

In short, today's weather is prime, pollen is minimal, but that ozone and BeltLine construction are your main headaches. Pick your battles, plan your route, and enjoy the glorious almost-spring.
