Alright, Atlanta, let's talk about today, February 28, 2026. It's a mixed bag out there, so don't just blindly lace up and hit the pavement.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  - The temperature is a sweet spot – clear skies and mild temps are perfect for getting out.
  - Don't let the clear skies fool you; the air quality isn't great, especially if your lungs are easily annoyed.
  - Good luck finding a smooth, uninterrupted run on the Atlanta BeltLine without dodging construction cones or rerouting.
  - A river flood warning is in effect for parts of North and Central Georgia, so keep an eye on those riverside paths.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

While the pollen count is blessedly low today, the air quality is still a bit... spicy. My initial data showed an AQI of 71, which is "Moderate," but other local sources are calling it "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups". The main culprit? Fine particulate matter, the stuff that makes your throat tickle and can mess with your lungs over time. It's also got a good dose of Nitrogen Dioxide floating around.

So, if you're prone to respiratory issues, or just like having fully functioning lungs, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to shorter bursts outdoors.

| Pollutant                | Level       | Guidance                                                                               |
| :----------------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fine Particulate Matter (&lt;2.5µm)** | Moderate/Fair | Can enter lungs and bloodstream, potential health issues with prolonged exposure. |
| **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)** | Poor        | Increases risk of respiratory problems, common coughing and difficulty breathing. |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Air Quality Alert:** Despite clear skies, the AQI is reported as "Poor" by some sources, unhealthy for sensitive groups. Reduce strenuous outdoor activity if you experience symptoms.
</AlertBox>

### BeltLine Blues: Construction Everywhere

Ah, the Atlanta BeltLine. Always a work in progress, and "progress" often means "detour." Expect significant construction, especially on the Southside and Northeast Trail segments.

*   **Southside Trail (Segments 2-5):** Multiple sections are seeing concrete pours, wall construction, and utility work. Expect closures and detours, especially around D.H. Stanton Park and the United Avenue ramp, which is closed until final work is complete.
*   **Northeast Trail "Gravel Rail Trail":** This section is currently fenced off for lighting and camera installation, with the main trail serving as the detour. Plan accordingly.

These aren't quick fixes; many of these projects are slated to continue through March or April 2026, and some Northwest Trail segments even into 2027/2028. Don't count on a clear run. Check the BeltLine's official updates before you head out, or just accept you'll be doing some creative navigation around Piedmont Park.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **BeltLine Construction Hazard:** Significant, widespread construction across multiple Atlanta BeltLine segments will cause detours, closures, and potential hazards. Do not assume clear passage.
</AlertBox>

### Water Hazards: Don't Get Your Feet Wet

There's a "River Flood Warning" in effect for North and Central Georgia as of early this morning. While metro Atlanta's main arteries might be clear, if your route takes you near the Chattahoochee River or any lower-lying areas prone to flooding, be aware. Recent heavy rains have moved out, but water levels can remain high.

Also, if you're hitting up any mountain bike trails like Dwelling Loop or Rhythm & Blues at Blankets Creek, expect some lingering mud from recent precipitation. Nothing worse than a surprise mud bog.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Local Rivers:** A River Flood Warning is active for parts of North and Central Georgia. Exercise caution on trails near rivers and low-lying areas.
</AlertBox>

### The Bottom Line:

It's a beautiful day temperature-wise, but the air quality demands attention, and the BeltLine is a minefield of construction. Plan your route, check local trail conditions before you leave, and prioritize those lungs.
