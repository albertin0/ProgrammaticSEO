Today's a classic Macon mixed bag for getting those miles in: the weather's decent, but what you breathe and where you step still demand your full attention.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>

*   **Lungs:** Air quality is sitting at a moderate 73 AQI, with inhalable particulate matter kicking around. This ain't wildfire smoke, but it's not exactly mountain air, either.
*   **Joints:** While the immediate threat of Saturday storms seems to have passed, some parts of the Ocmulgee Heritage Trail are still closed due to high water, and construction is a constant headache.
*   **Good News:** Pollen is low, and the temperature is cool and clear, perfect for breaking a sweat without baking.

## Macon's Outdoor Workout Report: February 28, 2026

Alright, runners and outdoor enthusiasts, let's cut to the chase. If you're planning on hitting the pavement or trails in Macon today, February 28th, you've got some things to consider beyond just lacing up your shoes. The morning is clear and cool, which is fantastic, but we’re not out of the woods entirely on a few fronts.

### Air Quality: Moderate PM10 – Don't Go Lung Busting

Your lungs are probably more important than that new PR, right? Today, we're seeing a moderate Air Quality Index (AQI) of 73, and the dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter, often referred to as PM10. This isn't ideal for intense outdoor activity. When you're really pushing it, you're breathing deeper and faster, pulling more of that microscopic junk into your respiratory system.

<AlertBox type="warning">

**AQI Warning: Moderate Air Quality for PM10.** If you're sensitive to air pollution, have asthma, or other respiratory issues, seriously consider dialing back the intensity of your workout. A brisk walk is probably fine, but don't try to set any speed records today if you feel any chest tightness or discomfort. Listen to your body – it's smarter than your ego.

### Trail Status: Ocmulgee's Still Underwater, Bass Road's a Mess

Remember that Weather Impact Alert from a couple of days ago about potential storms? While the immediate threat for severe weather this Saturday seems to have subsided, and we're looking at mostly clear conditions with only a 22% chance of rain for the day, the aftermath of previous high water persists. Portions of the Ocmulgee Heritage Trail, particularly around the Spring Street boat ramp, remain closed. Don't be a hero; floodwaters are no joke. They hide debris, strong currents, and unstable ground. Stick to higher, drier routes.

And speaking of routes, if your usual run takes you anywhere near Bass Road between New Forsyth Road and Providence Boulevard, prepare for perpetual chaos. The Bass Road Widening project is firmly in its "Right of Way" phase for 2026, which means disruptions are the new normal. We're also seeing bid activity for "Paving the Way Project 5" and ongoing work on Cherry Street sidewalks, so keep your head on a swivel for uneven surfaces and detours downtown.

<AlertBox type="danger">

**Immediate Danger: Ocmulgee Heritage Trail Closures!** Do NOT attempt to use closed sections of the Ocmulgee Heritage Trail. Flooded areas are dangerous and can lead to serious injury or worse. Respect the barriers.

</AlertBox>

### Pollen: A Minor Victory

Good news on one front: pollen levels are currently low. So, at least your sneezes won't be competing with your heavy breathing from the PM10.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

<AlertBox type="info">

**Pro Tip for Today:** Given the moderate AQI and trail closures, consider a change of scenery. Maybe hit up some of the less-congested neighborhood streets or do a track workout if you've got access. If you're really itching for trail time, double-check the Macon-Bibb County Parks & Rec site for current trail conditions before you head out, and have a Plan B. Hydration is always key, but even more so when your lungs are working overtime.
