Today? Unless you *enjoy* dodging puddles and getting side-eyed by construction crews, maybe stick to the treadmill.

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   **Rain is rolling in, and so are the slick surfaces.** Despite our lovely 18.5°C (that's 65°F for those still stuck in '90s metrics), the "Clear" skies promised earlier are a fantasy. Expect cloudy conditions with a 35% chance of rain today, jumping to 90% tonight. The National Weather Service even warns of "showers likely, with thunderstorms also possible after 4pm" and southwesterly gusts up to 25 mph. So, that "clear" run might turn into a soggy, slippery mess faster than you can say "shin splints."
*   **Ocmulgee River ain't playing nice.** If you had plans to hit up the **Amerson River Park** or the **Ocmulgee Heritage Trail**, forget about it. Parts of both are *still* closed due to rising river levels. That means boat ramps, dirt trails around the pond, and the paved stretch between the Overlook and the north boat ramp are off-limits. So much for your scenic long run.
*   **Ozone is being a party pooper.** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 71, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While not catastrophic, if you're asthmatic, have respiratory issues, or just want to avoid feeling like you're sucking down car exhaust on your tempo run, keep it indoors or scale back the intensity. Ozone tends to peak in the afternoon, right when you might be heading out.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail Closures: Amerson River Park and Ocmulgee Heritage Trail
Seriously, avoid the closed sections of Amerson River Park and the Ocmulgee Heritage Trail. The river levels are no joke, and those closures are for your safety, not just for fun. Trying to run on flooded or unstable paths is a recipe for a twisted ankle, or worse, a swim in the Ocmulgee.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch for Slick Roads and Gusty Winds
With rain on the way and winds gusting up to 25 mph, paved surfaces can get slick quickly. Be extra careful on bridges, painted crosswalks, and any shady spots that might not dry out. Falling is a lot less fun than running.

### Paving the Way for More Potholes (Eventually)
While the major "Paving the Way" road work has paused for winter, bids were due *today* for Project 5, covering roads like Clinton Rd and Riggins Mill Rd. This means planning is active, and soon enough, we'll be dealing with fresh construction zones. Keep an eye out for updated schedules and potential detours on your regular routes.

Stay safe out there, or just hit the elliptical. No one's judging (much).
