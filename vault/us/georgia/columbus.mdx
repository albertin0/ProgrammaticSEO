Looks like a day to embrace the treadmill or get soaked, folks, because Mother Nature in Columbus isn't exactly rolling out the red carpet for your outdoor endeavors today.

<BulletList>
*   **Rain, Rain, Go Away (or just stay off the trails):** Despite what some general forecasts might whisper, we're looking at light rain through the day and a higher chance of full-blown rain showers tonight in Muscogee County. This means wet, slippery conditions are a given, especially on natural surfaces.
*   **Ozone's Hanging Around:** An AQI of 65 isn't terrible, but with ozone as the dominant pollutant, those of you with sensitive lungs might feel it, particularly during prolonged exertion. It's in the "moderate" range, meaning generally acceptable, but don't expect crisp, clean air.
*   **Trail Trouble:** Remember how Standing Boy Trails keeps those multi-use paths pristine? They close them when wet to prevent damage and rutting. With rain coming down, consider those trails a no-go zone if you want to respect the volunteers and avoid a nasty fall.

## Today's Pollen Breakdown

So, pollen's not going to be your nemesis today, which is a small victory, I guess.

## The Full Rundown

Alright, Columbus, let's get real. It's February 26th, and while the temperature of 14.1°C might seem inviting, don't be fooled. The local forecast for Muscogee County is calling for light rain today and heavier rain tonight. That means anything unpaved, like sections of the Fall Line Trace once you hit some of the greener areas or especially those dedicated mountain biking and hiking trails at Standing Boy, is going to be slick, muddy, and frankly, a hazard to your ankles and knees.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Wet Trails Ahead!** If you're planning on hitting up natural trails, particularly places like Standing Boy, think twice. They explicitly state their multi-use trails are closed when wet to protect them. Pushing through muddy trails not only damages the path for everyone else but sets you up for slips, falls, and potential sprains. Nobody wants to hobble into my office with a torn meniscus because they couldn't resist a sloppy trail run.

Your lungs are getting a slightly better deal today, with a "Fair" air quality index of 65. However, ground-level ozone is the main culprit, which can irritate respiratory systems, especially if you're sensitive or really pushing it. Don't go expecting mountain air, even if you are slogging up some of those Columbus hills.

Construction-wise, nothing major has popped up in the last 24 hours to specifically block your favorite running routes. There's always the ongoing road work on portions of 8th Street from Front Avenue to Veterans Parkway, but that's more of a traffic headache than a workout stopper. No reports of wildfires or significant flooding in our immediate area that would impact your workout, which is good.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Paved is Your Pal:** If you absolutely *must* get outside, stick to paved surfaces like the main stretches of the Fall Line Trace or around Lakebottom Park. Even then, be mindful of slick spots and standing water. Your joints will thank you for choosing asphalt over ankle-deep mud today.

Seriously, it's not the day to set a PR on a technical trail. Your body will thank you for taking it easy, or at least sticking to the pavement and saving the heroics for a dry day.
