Today isn't the day to push for that PR if you're out early, Columbus. The air might look clear from your window *now*, but step outside pre-10 AM and you'll be running blind.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Early Morning Pea Soup:** There's a Dense Fog Advisory blanketing portions of central and west-central Georgia until 10 AM EST today. That means visibility is going to be a quarter-mile or less. You won't see that rogue squirrel, let alone a car on some of the less-lit sections of the Chattahoochee Riverwalk.
*   **Mediocre Air Quality:** We're sitting at an AQI of 77, with inhalable particulate matter being the main culprit. That's not "stay indoors and hermetically seal your house" bad, but it's not exactly crisp mountain air either. If your lungs are already finicky, you'll feel it.
*   **Otherwise, Not Terrible:** Once that fog burns off, we're looking at a clear day with temperatures around 10°C (50°F). Low pollen counts are a win for allergy sufferers.

## Today's Breakdown: Get the Details

The morning fog is no joke, folks. If you're planning an early run along the Chattahoochee Riverwalk, especially where it weaves through less developed areas or under bridges, you need to seriously reconsider. Reduced visibility is a recipe for tripping hazards, unexpected encounters with other trail users, or worse, not being seen by vehicles if you're near a road crossing.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Dense Fog Advisory until 10 AM EST!
Visibility is severely reduced. Delay your outdoor workout until mid-morning if possible. If you must go out, wear bright, reflective clothing and consider a headlamp or light. This isn't just about comfort; it's about not ending up in the ER with a busted face because you didn't see that uneven pavement.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the air. An AQI of 77 means the air quality is "low" according to some standards, specifically recommending that people with lung diseases (like asthma), children, older adults, and outdoor workers "reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion." It's not a full-blown alert, but it's certainly a yellow flag. Don't be a hero; listen to your body.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Air Quality (AQI 77)
Dominant pollutant is inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm). If you have respiratory issues, are an older adult, or are bringing kids along, dial back the intensity or shorten your time outside. Your lungs will thank you.
</AlertBox>

On the bright side, at least your nose won't be streaming with seasonal allergies. Pollen is low today, so that's one less thing to worry about. The river levels on the Chattahoochee at 14th Street are also well below flood stage, so no concerns there. We are also currently under "moderate" fire danger.

### Post-Fog Playbook
Once the fog lifts, the weather itself is quite pleasant for February. Dress in layers; it'll warm up nicely by lunchtime. Remember to hydrate, even when it's cool and clear. And for goodness sake, if you *do* brave the fog, make sure you're lit up like a Christmas tree.
