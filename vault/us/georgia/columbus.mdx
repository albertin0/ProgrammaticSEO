Alright, Columbus, today is a bit of a mixed bag for hitting the pavement, so choose your timing wisely.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Why today is/isn't the day:** The sun's out now and the temp is sweet, but don't get complacent – heavy rain is on its way this evening.
*   **Ozone Alert:** Our Air Quality Index is hanging in the moderate range at 68, with ozone being the main culprit. If you've got sensitive lungs, consider scaling back that high-intensity session.
*   **Construction Chaos:** Keep an eye out for ongoing road construction, particularly if you're venturing near 8th Street from Front Avenue to Veterans Parkway. Also, word on the street is the Dinglewood Park Trail project to link up with the Chattahoochee Riverwalk is gearing up to start construction, so expect some ground-breaking activity soon.

## The Rundown for February 26th

Today, we're sitting at a comfortable 19.6°C (67°F) under clear skies, which sounds like prime running weather, right? Enjoy it while it lasts, because the forecast for Muscogee County tonight is calling for some serious downpours with an 85% chance of heavy rain. That means if you're planning an evening long run, you're either going to get soaked or you'll be dodging puddles and slippery leaves on the Chattahoochee Riverwalk. My advice? Get out there *now* or hit the treadmill.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Evening Washout Warning
Don't be that runner caught unprepared. Heavy rain is expected to roll in tonight. Trails, especially those less-maintained sections, can become slick and treacherous. If you're out after dark, visibility will be shot. Seriously, just take your rest day or find some dry indoor space. Your ankles will thank you.

### Air Quality Check

Pollen is thankfully low today, so your sinuses might catch a break. However, the AQI is nudging into the "Moderate" category at 68, primarily due to ozone. For most of us, that's not a deal-breaker, but if you're prone to respiratory issues, pay attention to how you're feeling. Maybe don't sprint up and down those hills near the Columbus State University main campus quite as hard today. If you feel any irritation, pull it back a notch or two.

| Pollutant        | Level     | AQI Impact |
| :--------------- | :-------- | :--------- |
| **Pollen**       | Low       | Good       |
| **Air Quality**  | Moderate  | Ozone      |

### Gear Up for Changes & Stay Aware
With construction kicking off for projects like the Dinglewood Park Trail link, and general roadwork on 8th Street, expect potential detours or uneven surfaces. Keep your eyes peeled for construction crews and signage. Also, when that rain hits later, reflective gear and headlamps are non-negotiable if you insist on being outside. Nobody wants to be a statistic.

Don't let me scare you off completely – it's a decent day if you time it right. Just be smart about it, listen to your body, and respect Mother Nature (and the orange cones).
