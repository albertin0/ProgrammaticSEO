Alright, Savannah, listen up. Today's a pretty solid day to get out there and actually enjoy your run, despite what that persistent cloud cover might imply.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Temperature's Sweet:** At a balmy 21.6°C, it's basically Goldilocks weather for outdoor activity. Not too hot, not too cold. Just right for getting those miles in without overheating or freezing your earlobes off.
*   **Pollen's Playing Nice:** For once, the pollen count is low. Your sinuses can breathe a sigh of relief. This is a rare gift, don't squander it complaining about the minor cloudiness.
*   **AQI is Moderate, Not Mayhem:** While not "perfectly clear," an AQI of 58 with inhalable particulate matter is manageable for most. Just means your lungs might notice it if you're really pushing the pace, but it's far from the kind of air that makes you question all your life choices.

### Weather & Air Quality Breakdown

The weather folks are calling for cloudy skies today, with temperatures hovering around that pleasant 22°C mark. It's a nice change from the usual Savannah sun beating down on you, offering a bit of natural shade if you're hitting spots like the perimeter of Forsyth Park, which is looking good today, by the way. No major events or closures down there, so you can loop to your heart's content.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip for PM10:** If you're sensitive to particulate matter, consider sticking to routes with less vehicle traffic. The riverfront might have a bit more industrial activity, so maybe stick to the tree-lined squares if your lungs are particularly finicky.
</AlertBox>

Here's the lowdown on what's floating around:

| Pollutant Type | Level  |
| :------------- | :----- |
| Trees          | Low    |
| Grass          | Low    |
| Weeds          | Low    |

### Current Local Hazards & What to Watch For

Good news, folks – no major, sudden workout-stopping hazards have popped up in the last 24 hours. No wildfires creeping towards town, no flash floods shutting down the Truman Linear Park Trail, and the only extreme cold advisories are a distant memory from earlier in the month. Construction is always a thing in Savannah, but nothing new that should outright block your regular routes today.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step on the Riverwalk:** While the main Riverwalk area is clear, ongoing "Riverwalk / Bulkhead Improvement Project" means there could be localized activity or detours in the general vicinity. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially near construction zones.
</AlertBox>

Don't let the moderate AQI scare you indoors unless you've got serious respiratory issues. For the average runner, cyclist, or power walker, it's a non-issue today. Just stay hydrated and enjoy the mild February air. Tomorrow looks like rain, though, so make the most of this window.
