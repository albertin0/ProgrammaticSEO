Alright, Savannah, if you're thinking about hitting the pavement or trails today, it's a mixed bag; gorgeous temps but those winds might just blow your hair right off.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

### Why today is/isn't the day:
<BulletList>
*   That 12.6°C (54.7°F) temperature is pretty much perfect, and with low pollen, your lungs won't be staging a protest.
*   However, don't underestimate those winds, especially in open areas. We're looking at gusts up to 25-27 knots (around 28-31 mph) coming in from the SSW today. That's enough to throw off your stride and make you work harder.
*   The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 62, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not terrible, but it's not crystal-clear air either, so consider your respiratory sensitivity.

## The Full Breakdown

### Weathering the Wind
We're enjoying clear skies for the most part, which is a blessing after all the recent gloom. The low pollen count means you won't be sneezing your way through your workout, which is a win in my book. But seriously, the wind is the real headline for today. Gusts pushing 30 mph are no joke and can make balancing on tricky terrain a pain, or just add a whole lot of extra resistance to your ride or run. Heading out to the **Savannah National Wildlife Refuge**? Expect those open stretches along the Laurel Hill Wildlife Drive to be particularly blustery.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**High Winds Ahead!** Expect significant wind gusts up to 31 mph today. This isn't just a bad hair day; it can affect your stability, especially on bridges or open trails. Plan your route to minimize exposure if you're easily impacted, and be extra cautious of flying debris.

### Air Quality & Pollen
While the temperature is spot on for getting outside, our Air Quality Index is moderate due to ozone. For most of us, it's probably fine, but if you're sensitive to respiratory irritants, you might notice it on a long, hard effort. Keep your exertion levels in check if you're feeling it.

| Pollutant | Level | Dominant Pollutant |
| :-------- | :---- | :----------------- |
| AQI       | 62    | Ozone              |
| Pollen    | Low   |                    |

<AlertBox type="info">
**Moderate AQI Heads Up:** An AQI of 62 due to ozone means the air isn't perfectly crisp. If you have asthma or other respiratory issues, listen to your body and consider dialing back the intensity of your outdoor workout, or shorten your time outside.
</AlertBox>

### Construction & Closures
Good news on the local events front: I'm not seeing any major races or events scheduled to block off our usual running routes today. However, there's ongoing construction that could impact your commute to certain spots.

<AlertBox type="info">
**I-95 Construction:** Heads up for those traveling I-95 North from Knoxboro Creek Bridge to Savannah River Bridge. Lane closures are in effect overnight (Tues-Fri, 10 PM - 5 AM) due to SCDOT widening projects, ongoing until December 2027. If you're an early bird or late-night runner heading to or from trails via the interstate, factor in potential traffic.
</AlertBox>

Overall, a decent day for a workout if you're prepared to battle the wind. Hydrate, stay aware of your surroundings, and maybe reconsider that PR attempt until the gusts die down.
