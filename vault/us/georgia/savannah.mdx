Today is a decent day to get outside, but you'll want to plan around some local events and keep an eye on the air quality if your lungs are easily irritated.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "Moderate" Air Quality Index? It's the ozone talking, so if you're sensitive, don't push it too hard today.
*   The Truman Linear Park Trail is hosting a community run/walk this morning, so expect crowds and potential slowdowns if you planned a long, uninterrupted stride.
*   Evening events in the Starland District and at Juliette Low Park mean some areas will be bustling later on, especially if you're doing a dusk or night run.

## Savannah's Outdoor Rundown: February 28, 2026

Alright, Savannah, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the trails today. We've got pretty mild weather on tap – clear skies and temps hovering around a pleasant 13.9°C (that's about 57°F for those still in the dark ages). That's prime running weather for most of us, especially with a "Low" pollen count. So far, so good, right?

But here's the kicker: the Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at 86, which is "Moderate," and the dominant pollutant is ozone. What does that mean for your lungs? For the average person, you might not notice much. But if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally cranky airways, that ozone can feel like someone's trying to squeeze your lungs while you're working out. Don't be a hero; listen to your body. Maybe dial back the intensity or stick to an indoor session if you feel any tightness.

### Local Hazards & Hot Spots

The big one today for runners and walkers is the **Truman Linear Park Trail**. If you were planning on cruising down that path for your morning miles, think again. The Savannah Camellia Trail Community Run/Walk is happening bright and early this morning, kicking off around 9:00 AM EST. That means the trail will be packed with participants, festival-goers, and general chaos. If you're not part of the event, you'll want to find an alternate route or wait until later in the afternoon for things to clear out. There's nothing more frustrating than trying to hit a pace when you're dodging strollers and slower walkers, trust me.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Truman Linear Park Trail Congestion**: The Savannah Camellia Trail Community Run/Walk is taking over the Truman Linear Park Trail this morning. Expect significant crowds and limited space for your usual workout from 9 AM onwards. Plan an alternative route or time your run for later in the day.
</AlertBox>

Looking ahead to the evening, there are a few events that could cause some localized congestion. The Savannah Slithering Lantern Parade is scheduled for 6:30 PM in the Starland District, around Lincoln St & 41st St. Also, Rhyan Sinclair is playing at Juliette Low Park at 7:00 PM, and there's an "Afterlife Tours - Voices of the Dead Tour" at Telfair Square at 8:00 PM. If you're an evening runner who likes to explore those areas, be aware of increased foot traffic and potential street closures.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Alert**: While not a direct trail closure for runners, keep in mind there are ongoing lane closures on I-95 and I-16 in Chatham County due to GDOT road work, some wrapping up today. If your route takes you near these major arteries, stay vigilant for construction vehicles and altered traffic patterns.
</AlertBox>

Finally, a quick mental note about **Forsyth Park**. Back in December, there was a chemical attack there, which was a deeply unsettling incident for the community. While police stated there's no ongoing threat, it's a stark reminder to always stay aware of your surroundings, no matter how familiar or safe a spot feels. Running with a buddy or letting someone know your route and estimated return time is never a bad idea.
