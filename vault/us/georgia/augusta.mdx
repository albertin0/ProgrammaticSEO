Alright, Augusta, today isn't a terrible day to get outside, but you'll need to pick your routes wisely and keep an eye on the river.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 73 AQI, with ozone being the main culprit, so if your lungs are sensitive, dial it back.
*   The temperature is sweet at 16.8°C (around 62°F), but a Lake Wind Advisory means anything near the water might feel like you're running into a brick wall.
*   Pollen is practically nonexistent, which is a rare win for your sinuses this time of year.

## The Air You Breathe

Let's talk about that air. The AQI for Augusta today is 73, which officially puts us in the "Moderate" category. The dominant pollutant chilling in our atmosphere is ozone. Now, a 73 isn't going to kill you, but for folks with respiratory issues, or even just if you're pushing hard, you might notice some irritation. It’s always good practice to listen to your body, especially when ozone is in the air. This isn't like wildfire smoke where you're actively trying to avoid turning your lungs into charcoal, but it's still enough to warrant caution for sensitive individuals.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

That's right, a "Low" pollen count for February 26th! Take a moment to enjoy not having your face turn into a snot faucet, because we all know that won't last long around here.

## Weather Watch

Temperature-wise, 16.8°C (62°F) and clear skies sound absolutely perfect for a February run. However, don't let that fool you completely. There's a **Lake Wind Advisory** in effect for Richmond County until 5:00 PM today. That means if your usual loop takes you along the Savannah River or near J. Strom Thurmond Lake, you could be battling some serious gusts. This isn't just about making your run harder; strong winds near water can create choppy conditions for kayakers or paddleboarders and even affect stability on exposed bridges.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Wind Advisory for Lake Areas:** Expect strong winds near the Savannah River and Thurmond Lake today until 5 PM. If you're out on the water, be extra cautious, and runners should be prepared for headwinds.
</AlertBox>

Also, while the immediate conditions are clear per our data, the forecast for Richmond County *does* call for cloudy conditions and a high chance of rain later in the day and into the night. So, while your morning run might be glorious, don't count on staying dry if you're heading out this afternoon or evening.

## Local Hazards & Trail Notes

Speaking of riverfront runs, you need to know this: the **lower level of the Edward M. McIntyre Sr. Riverwalk** is temporarily closed. Augusta Recreation and Parks announced this closure, between 8th Street and the Augusta Marina, starting February 23rd. So if that's part of your usual route, plan an alternative. No word on when it'll reopen, but it's closed today. Don't be "that guy" trying to squeeze past the barricades; find another path.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Riverwalk Closure!** The lower level of the Edward M. McIntyre Sr. Riverwalk, specifically between 8th Street and the Augusta Marina, is temporarily closed. Avoid this section.
</AlertBox>

For those who prefer the Augusta Canal Authority trails, it looks like you're in the clear for any specific hazards or events today. The Towpath is always a solid choice, offering wide, relatively flat terrain, which is great when you might be battling some wind elsewhere. Just be mindful of that moderate AQI if you're pushing paces.

In short, it's not a bad day to run, but be smart about where you go. That Riverwalk closure is a pain, and the wind near the water could make you regret your life choices.
