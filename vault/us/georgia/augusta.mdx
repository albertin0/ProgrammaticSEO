Don't let the sunshine fool you, Augusta. Today's a decent day to get outside, but you still need to be smart about it, especially near the water and if your lungs aren't 100%.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   Temps are mild and the sky is clear, making for comfortable running weather, no complaints there.
*   Air quality is sitting in the moderate zone with ozone as the main player, so don't be shocked if your chest feels a little tight on those harder efforts.
*   A Lake Wind Advisory means things might get a bit blustery near the Savannah River and other open water, so dress accordingly or just deal with the headwind.
</BulletList>

## Today's Vitals

| Pollutant Category | Level   | Notes                                  |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------- |
| Pollen             | Low     | Easy breathing on this front.          |
| AQI                | Moderate | Dominant Pollutant: Ozone (65)         |
| Temperature        | 13.8°C (57°F) | Clear skies, comfortably cool.         |

It's February, and we're finally shaking off some of that winter chill. At 13.8°C and clear skies, you'd think it's a perfect day to hammer out some miles on the Augusta Canal National Heritage Area trail. And for most, it will be, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. The air quality in Augusta is clocking in at a moderate 65, with ozone taking center stage. While not "unhealthy," anyone with respiratory issues should probably dial back the intensity. Ozone isn't your friend when you're trying to max out your VO2.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Air Quality: Watch Your Lungs
With an AQI of 65, primarily due to ozone, sensitive groups (think asthmatics, older folks, and kids) might experience some minor respiratory irritation. If you feel it, cut your workout short. Also, remember that historically, controlled burns in the region can contribute to particulate matter, even if ozone is the dominant pollutant today, so stay vigilant and listen to your body.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of hazards, if your idea of a good workout involves being near the water, be aware there's a Lake Wind Advisory in effect until 5 PM today. This means gusty winds on exposed lake surfaces and along the Savannah River. So, if you're planning on paddling or just running a route that's exposed to the river, expect some extra resistance and potential chop. It won't exactly blow you over, but it's enough to make that 15-mile long run feel like 18.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Lake Wind Advisory Active
From 8 AM to 5 PM today, expect breezy conditions on and near lakes and the river. This means any paddleboarding or kayaking is going to be more of a grind, and runners along exposed sections of the Edward M. McIntyre Sr. Riverwalk might catch some significant headwinds.
</AlertBox>

Now, for those of you who like to keep things central, there's a heads-up about the Edward M. McIntyre Sr. Riverwalk. The lower level of the Riverwalk, specifically between 8th Street and the Augusta Marina, is temporarily closed. This was announced on Monday, February 23rd, and it's still in effect. Don't plan on making that your uninterrupted loop for today. You'll hit a roadblock, so plan an alternate route or prepare for a detour.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Riverwalk Section Closed
The lower level of the Edward M. McIntyre Sr. Riverwalk, from 8th Street to the Augusta Marina, is temporarily closed. Don't try to sneak through; find another path or stick to the upper level if you're determined to get your Riverwalk fix.
</AlertBox>

No major trail-blocking events or city-wide closures for races today (the Half Marathon is Saturday, don't worry, you're clear today), and construction on the new arena downtown, while ongoing, isn't impacting your typical running routes. Just be mindful of your lungs with that ozone and don't get blown into the river.
