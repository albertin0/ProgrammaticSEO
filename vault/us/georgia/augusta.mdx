If you're planning an outdoor workout in Augusta today, you might want to adjust your expectations and your route, unless you *are* part of the Augusta Half Marathon.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  - **Your Lungs Are Not a Filter:** While the temperature is a pleasant 12.7°C (about 55°F) and skies are clear, the Air Quality Index is sitting at a "moderate" 84, with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) as the main culprit. Augusta has a reputation for this kind of particle pollution, so don't be surprised if your usual breathing feels a bit heavier, especially if you're sensitive.
  - **Runners, Assemble! (And Block Everything):** Heads up, unless you're pinning on a bib, the Augusta Half Marathon, 10K, and 5K are taking over the streets from 7 AM to 11:15 AM. Expect significant delays and road closures around the Augusta University Summerville Campus on Walton Way, and impacting routes near the Augusta Canal, Summerville, Lakemont, and Lake Olmstead neighborhoods. Trying to squeeze in your usual long run on these routes is just asking for trouble, or at least a lot of yelling from course marshals.
  - **Construction, Always Construction:** Downtown still looks like a perpetual excavation site. Ongoing construction projects on Broad Street, Greene Street, and Telfair Street, which started back in 2023, mean detours and uneven surfaces are par for the course. Watch your step and assume every "temporary" change is now permanent.

## The Air You Breathe (or Don't)

Seriously, that AQI of 84 with PM2.5 isn't ideal for sustained hard efforts, even if it's "only" moderate. The experts are literally advising an N95 mask and staying indoors for air quality like this. So, if you're asthmatic, have lung issues, or just value your pulmonary health, maybe stick to the treadmill today. Your lungs will thank you for not trying to filter out all that microscopic gunk on the Augusta Canal trails.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Tree        | Low     |
| Grass       | Low     |
| Weed        | Low     |

Good news for allergy sufferers, the pollen count is low, so that's one less thing to make your eyes water and nose run.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Avoid the Half Marathon Route!** Unless you're an official participant, steer clear of the designated race routes today, especially those impacting the Augusta Canal, Summerville, Lakemont, and Lake Olmstead areas. Trying to share the road or trails with thousands of runners is unsafe and incredibly annoying for everyone involved.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Watch for Downtown Detours:** If your usual routine takes you through downtown Augusta, assume your preferred sidewalks or street crossings are probably closed or rerouted due to the multi-year construction projects. This isn't breaking news, but it's a constant low-level hazard for runners and cyclists.

  **Consider the Gym:** With the air quality being a bit iffy and major road closures, today might be a perfect day to hit up Max Fitness or Planet Fitness if you're looking for an uninterrupted, clean-air workout. Save the scenic runs for a day when Augusta isn't trying to suffocate you with fine particles or reroute you into a construction zone.
