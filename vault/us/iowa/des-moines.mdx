If you're looking for a smooth, uninterrupted run, today might not be your day, Des Moines.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Don't breathe deep, lung buttercup:** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a "moderate" 68, primarily thanks to inhalable particulate matter (PM10). If you've got cranky lungs, or even if you don't, you might feel this one. Take it easy.
*   **Watch your step, or don't step at all:** It's a brisk -3°C (26.6°F) out there, which means any moisture is ice. More importantly, half the city's trails are a construction zone right now. You're going to hit detours, or worse, dead ends.
*   **Pollen's taking a break:** At least your allergies won't be joining the party. Pollen levels are low, which is about the only good news for your respiratory system today.

## Des Moines, Meet Your February Freeze-Out (and Frustration)

Let's be real, folks. It's February 26th, and while the skies are clear, the mercury is stubbornly parked below freezing. That crisp air might *look* inviting, but that wind chill bites, and any untreated patches on sidewalks or lesser-used trails could be slicker than a politician's promise. Those joints, especially if you're hitting the pavement after a long week, are going to feel it.

Then there's the delightful obstacle course the city has laid out for us. You think you're going to just cruise along the Neal Smith Trail? Think again. Word on the street, and confirmed by the city's own Parks and Recreation, is that the **Neal Smith Trail** is currently shut down south of the Wakonsa Bridge and north of Riverview Park due to some "non-city construction work." "Non-city" or not, it's still blocking your route.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail Hunter's Warning:** If your usual route involves the Neal Smith Trail, the Kruidenier Trail around Gray's Lake, or even stretches of the Principal Riverwalk, you're likely running into closures. Construction is rampant.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, the construction updates read like a bad joke. The Kruidenier Trail around Gray's Lake is closed for new marina construction. Parts of the John Pat Dorrian Trail and the Principal Riverwalk are out of commission due to the Walnut Street Bridge reconstruction, slated to be closed until *some* point in 2026. And let's not forget the Chichaqua Valley Trail and Gay Lea Wilson Trail, which have been dealing with I-80 mixmaster rebuilds for months, with more closures expected later this year. It's a miracle if you can get more than a couple of miles without having to navigate a detour that spits you out onto a busy street with no shoulder.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**AQI Alert: Moderate Particulate Matter.** Your lungs are working harder today. An AQI of 68 with inhalable particulate matter means those tiny bits are floating around. If you've got asthma, COPD, or just a general aversion to inhaling microscopic crud, consider taking your workout indoors. Or at least keep it shorter and less intense.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Tree        | Low     |
| Grass       | Low     |
| Weed        | Low     |

No surprise there. It's practically frozen. The only thing blooming is probably some hardy mold in someone's damp basement.

Look, I get it. We're runners. We like to be outside. But sometimes, Mother Nature (and the Des Moines Public Works department) conspires against us. Today's one of those days where a treadmill, or maybe some cross-training, might be the smarter play. Or, if you insist on braving the elements and the maze of orange cones, pick your route *very* carefully and prepare for some serious rerouting. Your lungs and joints will thank you later.
