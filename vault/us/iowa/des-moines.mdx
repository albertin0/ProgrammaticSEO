Don't expect miracles out there today, Des Moines. It's clear, but chilly, and the ground's still playing games.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Nippy Air:** At 0.6°C (33°F) and feeling more like -3°C (27°F), you'll want layers. The clear skies are nice, but they don't erase the bite.
*   **AQI's a Bummer:** Air Quality Index is sitting at 78 due to ozone. Not horrible, but not exactly "crisp mountain air" either. Just moderate.
*   **Ice, Ice, Maybe Baby:** With overnight lows predicted to dip to -7°C (20°F) after a daytime high around 7°C (44°F), any wet spots from melted snow or lingering moisture are prime candidates for refreezing. Watch your step.
</BulletList>

Look, the sun's out, which is a blessing after some of the gloomy stretches we've had this winter. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's prime running weather without some forethought. That mercury hovering just above freezing, then dropping at night, is a recipe for black ice on those shaded paths and bridges. We're still in that "winter isn't quite done with us" phase, and your knees will thank you for being smart about it.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch for the Slick Stuff
Even if it looks dry, expect sneaky ice patches, especially on overpasses, shaded sections of trails, and residential streets that don't get much sun. A minor slip isn't just embarrassing; it's a sprained ankle waiting to happen. Consider traction aids for your shoes if you're hitting anything remotely unpaved or questionable.
</AlertBox>

Pollen counts are low today, which is a win for anyone who usually struggles. So, your lungs aren't fighting allergens, just slightly elevated ozone. It's moderate, so if you're sensitive, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to shorter bursts.

Now, about those trails. While I haven't seen any *new* flash flooding warnings for the city proper in the last 24 hours, the ground is often saturated this time of year, and river flooding has been a concern further north in Iowa. More importantly, the **Clive Greenbelt Trail** has been undergoing closures since way back in 2024. If that's part of your usual route, check for updates before you head out, because detours can add unexpected mileage or put you on less-than-ideal surfaces.

### Construction Zone Ahead (Literally)
The city is gearing up for various street repairs and infrastructure projects to kick off in the spring. While many are still in the bidding phase, keep an eye on areas like Locust Street or 42nd Street and Madison Avenue for potential disruptions down the line. Always check the City of Des Moines road and trail closures page before you head out. Nobody likes an unexpected dead end on a long run.

Finally, while the extreme fire risk from yesterday (a "Red Flag Warning" for portions of southern and eastern Iowa) isn't directly impacting our air quality today, remember that dry vegetation can still catch quickly. Be mindful if you're out in any grassy areas, especially with clearing skies. Don't be the person who starts something stupid.

In short: bundle up, watch your footing, and check for any known closures before you hit your stride. It's a decent day to get outside, but it demands respect.
