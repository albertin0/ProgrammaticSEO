Alright, Des Moines, let's talk turkey about getting your run in today.

Honestly, it's a bit of a mixed bag, but lean towards the treadmill.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI of 65 might look "moderate" on paper, but with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, AccuWeather is calling it "Poor" for today and warning sensitive folks to limit time outside. Your lungs deserve better than breathing in that crud.
*   Don't even *think* about hitting some of your usual river routes. The Des Moines River trails east of Water Street are shut down due to high water, and those Grays Lake trails? Still dealing with water, too. Nobody wants an unexpected swim on their long run.
*   Wind gusts up to 26 mph are expected over the next few hours. That's not just a stiff breeze; that's the kind of wind that turns a casual jog into a full-body fight against the elements, especially when you're already breathing harder.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail Advisory: Neal Smith Trail Partial Closure**
Heads up if you were planning on a scenic long run up the Neal Smith Trail. There's ongoing "non-city construction work" causing a closure south of the Wakonsa Bridge and north of Riverview Park. Don't waste your time heading out there only to hit a barricade. Check the city's updates before you go, or better yet, pick a different route.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pollen Report: Low**
Good news if your allergies usually act up – pollen levels are low today, mostly cedar/juniper. So, at least you won't be snotting your way through the murky air and fighting the wind.
</AlertBox>

Today's 7.4°C (about 45°F) is decent, but honestly, the trifecta of questionable air, closed trails, and strong winds makes for a pretty cruddy outdoor workout. If you're really itching to get out, keep it short, stay far from the rivers, and be ready to battle the gusts. Otherwise, hit the gym or embrace the stairwell.
