<BulletList>

*   **Rain, Rain, Go Away (It Won't):** We're looking at a near 100% chance of rain all day. Not a drizzle, folks, but actual, persistent rain. You'll be soaked, and everything else will be too.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is clocking in at 78, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. That's "Moderate," meaning it's okay for most, but if you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, you might feel it.
*   **Slick City:** All that rain means every trail, sidewalk, and patch of asphalt is going to be slick as ice. Your ankles and knees will thank you for taking it easy.

Seriously, if you had grand plans for a long run on the Cape Fear River Trail, you're going to be dodging puddles the size of small ponds and hoping you don't end up on your backside. The weather forecast specifically calls for rain all day, transitioning to light rain by night, with temperatures hovering around a damp 15°C (59°F). Not exactly ideal for setting any personal bests, unless your PB involves how many times you can slip without falling.

### Watch Your Step – Seriously
With the constant rain, roads, sidewalks, and especially dirt trails like sections of the Cape Fear River Trail will be incredibly slick. Expect reduced traction and potential for hidden puddles. Your ankles, knees, and pride are at stake. Don't be that person explaining a sprain because you *had* to get your miles in.

While there aren't any current wildfire alerts or major construction blocking off entire workout routes today, the rain is your primary antagonist. And let's not forget that AQI. A 78 isn't a red alert, but it's enough to make you think twice if you're sensitive. Keep those inhalers handy or maybe just hit the treadmill. Your lungs might appreciate not sucking down extra ozone with your drenched breath.

### AQI Breakdown: What 78 (Ozone) Means
An Air Quality Index of 78 is considered moderate. For most people, there's little to no risk. However, if you're unusually sensitive to air pollution or have pre-existing respiratory conditions, you might experience minor symptoms. Pay attention to how you feel, especially during prolonged exertion.

Here's the lowdown on the other environmental factors:

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant | Temperature (°C) | Condition |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- | :--------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 78  | Ozone              | 15               | Cloudy, Rain |

So, there you have it. It’s a good day to stay inside, maybe do some strength work, or catch up on that TV show you’ve been meaning to watch. Your body will thank you.
