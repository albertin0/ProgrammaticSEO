Alright, Fayetteville, listen up. Today's a pretty decent day to get out there, but keep that air quality in mind, especially if your lungs are a bit finicky.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   The weather gods are smiling down on us: clear skies and a cool 7.5°C (45.5°F) make for a comfortable run. Perfect for getting those miles in without baking or freezing.
*   Pollen levels are delightfully low, so your sinuses can breathe a sigh of relief. No post-run sneeze attacks today.
*   The fly in the ointment? Our air quality. An AQI of 69 means it's moderate, with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) being the dominant pollutant. It's not terrible, but it's not sparkling either.

## Environmental Rundown

It's a mixed bag today, folks. While the conditions are clear and the temperature is on the cooler side, the air quality demands a bit of attention.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Pollen counts are staying down, which is a blessing for anyone usually battling seasonal sniffles. Enjoy those clear airways!

### Air Quality Index (AQI): Moderate

Our AQI is sitting at 69, which falls into the "Moderate" category. The main culprit? Fine particulate matter (PM2.5). What does that mean for you? For most healthy individuals, it's generally acceptable. You might not even notice it. But if you're part of a "sensitive group" – think folks with asthma, heart conditions, or just sensitive lungs – you could experience minor to moderate symptoms if you're out for an extended period. The North Carolina Division of Air Quality noted that fine particulate levels are expected to remain in the low Code Yellow (Moderate) range across much of the state today.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip for Moderate AQI:** If you're sensitive, consider scaling back the intensity of your workout or sticking to shorter distances. Running early in the morning might catch slightly better air before daily activities stir things up, though the particulates are a year-round concern. Stick to residential streets if you can, away from heavy traffic exhaust.

## Local Hazards & Trail Talk

Good news on the local hazard front: after digging through the recent noise, there are no immediate, widespread trail closures or major weather-related disruptions directly affecting our main running routes, like the Cape Fear River Trail.

However, Fayetteville's always got something cooking, and while not directly impacting trails *today*, it's worth noting. The City of Fayetteville has ongoing bond projects, with construction bids for the McArthur Road Sports Complex due this month. A big downtown development project near Hay Street is slated to break ground in June 2026, which will bring more changes to the urban landscape. For now, though, your usual trail loops should be clear of *new* heavy machinery blocking your path.

Just a reminder that while the temperatures are comfortable, dress in layers. 7.5°C (45.5°F) is great once you get moving, but that morning chill can bite.

*Data grounded with AccuWeather and NC State University from February 28, 2026.*
