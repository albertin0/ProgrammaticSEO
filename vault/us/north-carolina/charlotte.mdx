Alright, Charlotte. Today's not quite a "drop everything and run wild" day, but it's far from a write-off.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The weather is actually pretty great for February, but don't let that fool you into thinking everything's perfect.
*   That "moderate" AQI isn't just a number; you're breathing that fine particulate matter whether you feel it or not.
*   Seriously, check your route. Freedom Park is a mess right now, and nobody likes an unexpected detour or heavy machinery on their run.
</BulletList>

Look, I know you've been itching to get outside, and at 9°C and clear skies, it's certainly tempting. It's mild for late February, a welcome break from the usual chill, but Charlotte always has a curveball, doesn't it?

First up, that "Moderate" air quality. It’s sitting at an AQI of 75 with fine particulate matter as the star pollutant. That means tiny airborne crud is floating around, potentially irritating your lungs, especially if you're pushing hard. While Mecklenburg County usually boasts about clean air days, today isn't one of its best, even if it's not terrible. For those of us with sensitive lungs or who are just trying to keep them healthy for the next marathon, it's something to consider. Don't go sucking wind next to a busy road like Independence Boulevard if you can avoid it.

Then there's the pollen. It's "Moderate," and we all know what that means for our noses, throats, and eyes. The early spring bloomers are already doing their thing, so if you're usually a snotty mess this time of year, today won't be an exception.

The biggest headache, however, is the ongoing work at Freedom Park. If that's your usual stomping ground, be aware that pond restoration began this week, and it's brought with it temporary trail closures and parking restrictions, particularly at Whittington Field on weekday mornings. This isn't a quick fix either; they expect to be at it until summer. So, while the park is technically open, certain routes are off-limits, and nobody wants to dodge dredging equipment or construction barriers while trying to hit a PR.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Freedom Park Trail Alert!**
Ongoing pond restoration means temporary trail closures and parking restrictions at Freedom Park, especially around Whittington Field. Don't assume your usual loop is clear; check for signs and active work zones before you get too far into your run.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**AQI & Pollen Protection**
With moderate AQI and pollen levels, consider sticking to less trafficked routes, especially away from major roadways where vehicle emissions contribute to particulate matter. If your allergies are usually bad, pre-dose your antihistamines and maybe even wear some sport sunglasses to keep pollen out of your eyes.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today's workout isn't a no-go, but it requires a bit more thought than just lacing up and heading out. Pick your route wisely, stay hydrated, and give those lungs and joints a break from the worst of the urban crud.
