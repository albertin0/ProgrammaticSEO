Today is a soggy mess for a run, even if the temperature is halfway decent.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Rain, rain, go away:** Despite what your phone might tell you, expect rain and cloudy skies through the day. You're going to get wet out there, and those trails will be slick.
*   **Don't breathe too deep:** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at 82, with nitrogen dioxide as the dominant pollutant. That's "Poor" for sensitive groups, so if you've got asthma or are just generally not a fan of irritated lungs, maybe take it easy, especially outside.
*   **Trail closed signs are your new best friends:** Good luck finding clear paths. Between major restoration work at Freedom Park and general closures at the Whitewater Center, your usual routes are probably impacted.
</BulletList>

Alright, Charlotte, let's talk about actually getting a workout in today without winding up in my physical therapy office. The weather apps are playing games; while it's a mild 13-14°C (mid-50s F), expect light rain and a high chance of precipitation throughout the day. That "clear" forecast you might have seen? Lies. Pure lies. Those greenways and paved trails are going to be greasy.

Then there's the air. An AQI of 82 isn't great. We're talking "Moderate" to "Poor" for those of us with sensitive respiratory systems, and the dominant pollutant is nitrogen dioxide. So, if you're out there pushing intervals, you're not just working your lungs, you're giving them a dose of something they don't particularly want. Children, older adults, and anyone with lung issues should seriously consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.

The biggest headache, though? The closures.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Freedom Park:** Crews are knee-deep in pond restoration work, and that started on February 23rd. This means certain paths are completely off-limits until summer, and the parking lot at Whittington Field is closed weekday mornings. Don't try to sneak around the barriers; it's not worth a twisted ankle or worse.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Whitewater Center:** If you were hoping to hit the trails out at the U.S. National Whitewater Center, forget it. Their trails are currently closed.
</AlertBox>

And let's not forget the ongoing greenway construction. Mecklenburg County has *20 miles* of greenways under construction. While some of the older, longer-term closures like parts of the Little Sugar Creek Greenway near Midtown (scaffolding and dismount zones for roughly two years) or sections of the Rail Trail near New Bern Station are winding down or have detours, you're still going to run into surprises. Always, always check local park and recreation updates before you head out, because that "accessible detour" might just add an extra mile or two of pavement you weren't planning on.

So, if you absolutely *must* get outside, wear reflective gear, assume every surface is slicker than snot on a doorknob, and stick to well-lit, open areas away from construction. Maybe just hit the treadmill today, or find an indoor track. Your lungs and joints will thank you.
