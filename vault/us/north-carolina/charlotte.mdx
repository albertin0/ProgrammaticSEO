Alright, Charlotte, today's one of those days where the air looks clearer than it actually is, but the temperature? Chef's kiss. So, if you're hitting the pavement or the dirt, choose wisely.

## The Rundown: Don't Breathe Too Deep, Watch Your Step

Look, I love a good 50-degree day as much as the next runner who isn't trying to scrape ice off their car, and at a lovely 11.6°C (that's about 53°F for the Fahrenheit folks), today feels pretty good. The sun's out, and honestly, after the wild swings we've had this winter, this is a welcome reprieve.

But before you lace up and dash out the door thinking it's all sunshine and PRs, let's talk real.

### Air Quality: The Invisible Grime

The Air Quality Index (AQI) for Charlotte is sitting at 66, which is "moderate." The main culprit? Ozone. Now, 66 isn't going to send you to the ER, but it's enough to notice if you're pushing hard or have sensitive lungs. It means there's enough junk in the air that some people, especially those with respiratory issues, might experience some discomfort. So, maybe dial back that all-out sprint or consider an indoor session if you're prone to wheezing. Don't be a hero.

Here's the lowdown on today's airborne annoyances:

| Pollutant         | Level       |
| :---------------- | :---------- |
| **Pollen**        | Low         |
| **Dominant AQI**  | Ozone (66)  |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Ozone Alert:** While pollen is low, the moderate ozone levels (AQI 66) mean it's not a perfectly clear breathing day. If you're sensitive, consider an easier pace or shorter route.
</AlertBox>

### Trail Troubles: Freedom Park's Face-Lift & Rail Trail Reroutes

If your go-to is **Freedom Park**, you're going to need a new game plan for a while. The pond restoration project is in full swing, having started on February 23rd, and it's expected to drag on until summer. This means parts of the park are blocked off, and even the parking lot at Whittington Field is closed on weekday mornings. They've got barriers up, and you *will* need to pay attention to posted signs. Don't be "that guy" trying to duck under the tape. Respect the construction zones; it's safer for everyone, and let's be honest, you don't want to explain why your ankle is suddenly the size of a grapefruit because you ignored a warning.

Speaking of detours, the Charlotte Rail Trail in South End might still have some lingering issues. A drainage project between Poindexter Drive and New Bern Street was supposed to wrap up by January 2026. While that's technically past, construction projects in this city are like a bad habit – they tend to overstay their welcome. It's always smart to check for current closures or just mentally prepare for a sudden reroute if you're planning a long run down there.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Check Before You Go:** Always scout your chosen route online or be ready for unexpected detours, especially around Freedom Park and potentially the Rail Trail.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Slippery When Wet:** Charlotte has seen some rain recently. Even with clear skies today, trails and sidewalks, especially those shaded or less-trafficked, could be damp or muddy. Watch your footing to avoid a surprise slip-and-slide.
</AlertBox>

So, enjoy the mild weather, but keep your head on a swivel. Your lungs and joints will thank you.
