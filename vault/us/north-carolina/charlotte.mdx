Today? It's one of those Charlotte days that looks decent on paper but has a few annoying asterisks you absolutely need to acknowledge before lacing up.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **AQI's a bit spicy.** We're sitting at a "Moderate" 82, with Nitrogen dioxide leading the charge. Your lungs might notice it, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   **Freedom Park is still a partial mess.** Pond restoration means some usual routes are off-limits, and Whittington Field parking is a no-go on weekday mornings. Plan accordingly or find another spot.
*   **Pollen's playing nice.** For once, your sinuses might actually thank you.

## The Full Rundown: What to Expect Out There

Alright, let's cut to the chase. The weather gods are being reasonably kind today, serving up a clear sky and a comfortable 13°C. That's prime running weather for keeping your joints happy without overheating. And blessedly, the pollen count is low, so those of us who usually spend March sounding like a dying kazoo can breathe a little easier.

However, don't let the clear skies fool you into thinking it's perfect. Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 82, which the EPA handily labels as "Moderate." The dominant pollutant today is Nitrogen dioxide. What does that mean for your lungs? Well, if you're usually sensitive to air pollution – think folks with asthma, older adults, or kids – you might experience some minor to moderate symptoms if you're out there for prolonged periods or really pushing the pace. It's not a "stay indoors" kind of day for everyone, but if you feel any throat irritation or difficulty breathing, dial it back or call it a day. The NC Department of Air Quality also noted some elevated fine particulate levels from prescribed burns to our southwest recently, which could still be lingering and contributing to that moderate score.

Now, for the really local headache: Freedom Park. If that's your usual stomping ground, be aware that pond restoration work is still underway. This project, which kicked off on February 23rd, means certain trails are closed, and the parking lot at Whittington Field is blocked off during weekday mornings. You're going to see construction crews and equipment, so stay clear, respect the barriers, and don't try to be a hero navigating closed paths. This work is expected to last through the summer, so get used to finding alternative routes or parks if Freedom Park is your jam.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory: Moderate Air Quality (82 AQI - Nitrogen dioxide)**
While not terrible, an AQI of 82 means the air quality is "Moderate." If you're in a sensitive group (asthma, heart issues, elderly, children, or just working out hard), consider reducing the intensity or duration of your outdoor activity today. Pay attention to how your body feels.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Freedom Park Trail Closures**
Seriously, folks, don't ignore the signs. Pond restoration means parts of Freedom Park are closed for your safety and the project's progress. This includes specific trails and the Whittington Field parking lot during weekday mornings. Find an alternative route or park to avoid frustration and potential hazards.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration is always key.** Even on a mild, clear day like today, keep that water bottle handy. Your body needs it, especially if the moderate air quality is putting a little extra strain on your system.
