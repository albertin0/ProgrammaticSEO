Forget your PR today, folks; it's a "listen to your lungs" kind of day in the Bull City.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is officially "Moderate" thanks to a delightful dose of inhalable particulate matter. Your lungs might feel this, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   Pollen is low, which is a rare win for our allergy-ridden populace, so at least you won't be snotting your way through your miles.
*   The temperature is a crisp 12.1°C and clear, which would be perfect if we weren't breathing in microscopic crud.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. You've got miles to hit, routines to maintain. But today isn't the day to try and set a personal best on the American Tobacco Trail. That moderate AQI isn't a suggestion; it's a real-deal caution, especially with the dominant pollutant being PM10. Think about it: tiny particles, getting sucked deep into your respiratory system during heavy exertion. Not exactly a recipe for peak performance or long-term lung health.

If you absolutely *must* get out, keep it easy. Slow down. Don't push that threshold work you had planned. If you start feeling any irritation in your throat, shortness of breath, or a cough, turn around and head home. Seriously, your body will thank you later. This isn't a "tough it out" situation; it's a "don't be an idiot" situation.

And speaking of getting around, if you're trying to hit those urban routes, good luck. Durham's got more ongoing construction than a perpetually unfinished jigsaw puzzle. The American Tobacco District, in particular, is a minefield of waterline replacement projects slated to go on until spring 2027. Jackie Robinson Drive had some recent closures, and there's work planned for Main & Broad. Don't be surprised if your usual loop through downtown has you playing Frogger with detours and heavy machinery. Plan your route, or better yet, find a less congested spot.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level       |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| Overall     | Low |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality Alert:** With an AQI of 76 and inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) as the dominant pollutant, sensitive groups should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. Even for healthy individuals, listen to your body and consider reducing intensity or duration of workouts.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Chaos Continues:** Numerous projects, including the American Tobacco District Waterline Replacement, Main & Broad Street Waterline, and various road improvements (like on NC 54), mean detours and disruptions are likely for urban running and cycling routes. Check the City of Durham's closures page before you head out, or stick to trails further from major thoroughfares.
