If you were planning on a clear, crisp Durham run today, you're going to be disappointed.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Rainy Daze:** Despite what you might *wish* for, the forecast for today is a solid dose of rain, especially before 2 PM. Expect wet roads, slick sidewalks, and muddy trails.
*   **Moderate Air, But Still Ozone:** AQI is clocking in at 60 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not terrible, but it's not exactly sparkling clean air for your lungs to suck down during high-intensity efforts.
*   **Construction Chaos (Still):** Various construction projects are ongoing across the city, from waterline replacements in the American Tobacco District to road work on West Club Boulevard. These aren't new, but they mean potential detours, closed sidewalks, and general headaches for your route.
</BulletList>

Forget that "clear" weather you might have heard; the actual forecast for Durham on Thursday, February 26th, is light rain throughout the day. That 12.2°C (54°F) might sound mild, but it'll feel chillier and a whole lot wetter when it's actively raining. So, adjust your gear and expectations.

The good news? Pollen is low today. Enjoy it while it lasts, because spring allergies will be here before you know it, coating everything in that delightful yellow dust.

Now, about those trails. If you're thinking of hitting the Eno River State Park trails, be extra cautious. While there's no *new* widespread flooding reported in the last 24 hours, Durham County has seen significant flooding in the past, causing trail damage and closures, particularly near the Eno. The Mountains-to-Sea Trail between Cole Mill Road and Guess Road was still closed due to damage from a past tropical storm as of late last year, and rain today isn't going to help conditions on any already compromised paths. Expect muddy sections, standing water in low-lying areas, and slick rocks or roots. Your ankles will thank you for taking it easy.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step on Wet Trails:** With rain falling, even well-maintained trails like parts of the American Tobacco Trail can become slippery. Roots, boardwalks, and crushed gravel sections will be less forgiving. Slow down, shorten your stride, and wear shoes with good traction.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Buttercup:** A light, waterproof outer layer is your friend today. You'll want something breathable enough to manage the 12°C temp, but protective against the drizzle. Don't forget a hat to keep the rain out of your eyes.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Don't Be a Hero, Seriously:** If you encounter standing water on roads or trails, turn around. "Turn Around, Don't Drown" isn't just a catchy phrase; it's common sense. You don't know what's underneath that water, and it's absolutely not worth the risk.
</AlertBox>

Stick to paved routes if you're worried about trail conditions, but even then, keep an eye out for construction zones. Multiple waterline projects and general resurfacing work are happening around town, which can mean unexpected detours or uneven surfaces.

Bottom line: If you're heading out, dress for rain, be mindful of your footing, and stay informed about local closures.
