Today? If you're heading downtown, be prepared for a festive maze of humanity and machinery; otherwise, it's a tolerable if chilly day for a run.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Moderate air quality due to fine particulate matter might make some folks feel it in their lungs.
*   Significant road closures and noise in the downtown core will make navigation a pain for urban runners.
*   The Fire & Ice festival means downtown will be crawling with people, ice sculptures, and potential route blockages.

## The Downtown Gauntlet: Construction & Ice Sculptures Galore

Alright, Durham, listen up. Today, February 28th, if your route takes you anywhere near the **American Tobacco District** or the heart of downtown, you're going to need to adjust your expectations. This isn't just a casual Saturday; it's an obstacle course.

First off, our friends at the City are busy with waterline installation. This means **Jackie Robinson Drive between Blackwell Street and Mangum Street** is dealing with lane closures. Expect the same headaches on Blackwell and Mangum streets themselves. We're talking active construction from 7 AM to 7 PM, complete with "noise levels in excess of the current City noise ordinance." So, if your usual warm-up loop involves dodging cones and listening to jackhammers, you're in luck. On-street parking in this area is also closed, adding to the general chaos if you were planning to drive in and run.

As if dodging heavy machinery wasn't enough, downtown Durham is also hosting the **Fire & Ice** event today. This means ice sculptures, live displays, and "fiery performances" transforming the city center. While it sounds cool for spectators, for runners, it means crowds, potential detours, and even more congestion in an already impacted area. If you're hitting the sidewalks, keep your head on a swivel.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Downtown Disruption Alert!** Avoid Jackie Robinson Drive, Blackwell Street, and Mangum Street if you're looking for an uninterrupted run. Expect lane closures, loud construction, and crowded sidewalks due to the Fire & Ice festival. Plan your routes to the west or east of the core, or head for the trails.

## Breathing Room (Mostly) & Chilly Air

Let's talk about what you'll be breathing. Our Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at 65. That's "Moderate," with fine particulate matter being the dominant pollutant. For most of us, that's fine, but if you've got sensitive lungs or any respiratory issues, you might feel a bit of irritation. This isn't a "stay inside" day by any means, but it's not pristine mountain air either.

On the bright side, pollen is low. So, if your spring allergies usually have you sniffling through February, you're getting a reprieve today.

### Pollen Breakdown

The weather is clear, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's warm. We're looking at a brisk 5.4°C (that's about 41.7°F). It's certainly not extreme cold, but it's enough to warrant layers.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up!** With temperatures hovering around 41°F, proper layering is key to a comfortable outdoor workout. Start warm, and shed layers as you heat up.
</AlertBox>

So, if you can navigate the downtown spectacle or, better yet, find a quieter spot like a stretch of the American Tobacco Trail further south (no current specific alerts for its main sections today, unlike the downtown roads), you're in for a decent, albeit brisk, workout. Just keep an eye out for folks admiring ice sculptures and give those construction zones a wide berth.
