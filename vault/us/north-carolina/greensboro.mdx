Alright, Greensboro, it's one of those days where Mother Nature gives you a little, and the city takes a little. You *can* get out there, but don't say I didn't warn you about the detours and that lovely air.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  - The temperature is solid for a run, and at least the trees aren't actively trying to kill your sinuses with pollen.
  - That "moderate" air quality means some of you with sensitive lungs will definitely feel that ozone. It's not great, not terrible.
  - Construction season is *always* in full swing here, so expect some route headaches, especially if you're hitting the greenways.
</BulletList>

## Environmental Breakdown

## Today's Local Rundown

Let's be real, you probably looked outside, saw the sun, and thought, "Finally!" And yeah, the clear skies and 10.8°C (that's about 51 degrees Fahrenheit for us non-metric folks) are pretty damn nice for February 26th. Low pollen is a bonus, so your nose won't be staging a rebellion.

But before you lace up and sprint out the door feeling invincible, let's chat about that AQI. We're sitting at a "moderate" 77, with ozone being the main culprit. For most of you, it's just background noise. For anyone with asthma, COPD, or just generally sensitive airways, you might notice it. It's not a "stay indoors and panic" level, but if you start feeling that familiar tickle in your throat or your chest feels a bit tight, dial back the intensity or cut your workout short. This isn't the day to try for a PR if your lungs are already protesting.

### Mind the Construction, Greensboro!

Now for the real fun: the construction. The City of Greensboro has decided that this week is prime time for ripping up our roads, which inevitably impacts our beloved trails and greenways.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Active Road & Greenway Closures:** If your usual route takes you anywhere near **West Greenway Drive South**, be aware that sections are closed daily and will remain so through at least Monday, March 2nd. This isn't just a minor inconvenience; plan for a re-route or prepare to hit some pavement you might not have intended. Same goes for **South Holden Road** with paving work that started yesterday. And don't forget **West Sycamore Street**, which is still closed for construction today, though it's set to reopen tomorrow, February 27th.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, if you're trying to get a decent long run in, check the city's road closure maps *before* you head out, unless you enjoy impromptu urban orienteering.

### Evening Buzz on the Downtown Greenway

<AlertBox type="info">
  Heads up for evening runners and walkers: The **Downtown Greenway** will be hosting a "Run & Walk Club" tonight from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. This means more foot traffic than usual. If you prefer solitude, aim for earlier in the day or pick a different spot. If you thrive on group energy, knock yourself out.
</AlertBox>

In short, it's a mixed bag. The weather itself is cooperating, but the air quality isn't pristine, and you're going to need to navigate around the city's ongoing efforts to rebuild itself. Stick to smart training, listen to your body, and don't get flattened by a paver on South Holden.
