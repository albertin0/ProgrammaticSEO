Today's a mixed bag for hitting the pavement or trails, Greensboro – good temps but watch where you step, and what you breathe.

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   That 11°C (51.8°F) and clear skies are looking pretty inviting for a run. Your joints will thank you for not freezing them solid or baking them in the sun.
*   The Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 75, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. That's moderate, folks. Not "lung-shredding," but definitely not "crisp mountain air" either. If you're sensitive, or planning an intense, long effort, you might feel it.
*   Pollen is low, so at least you won't be snot-bubbling your way through every mile.

## The Local Lowdown

It wouldn't be Greensboro without some construction or trail shenanigans, would it?

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Major Trail Closures
Heads up, especially for you long-distance folks: a significant section of the **Downtown Greenway's Western Branch is still an active construction zone and completely off-limits** from Smith Street to Spring Garden Street. Don't be that person hopping fences; it's dangerous, and you'll just mess up someone's workday. Plan an alternate route if your usual involves this stretch.

Even worse for those looking to get out of downtown, the **northernmost trestle bridge on the Atlantic & Yadkin Greenway, between Strawberry Road and Bur-Mil Park, remains closed**. This isn't a new development (it's been shut since October 2023), and there's *still* no paved detour. So if you were hoping for a smooth ride or run up toward Summerfield, you're out of luck unless you fancy some serious road shoulder action or turning back. Factor that into your mileage if Bur-Mil is your usual starting point or turnaround.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Road Work to Note
Beyond the greenways, there's ongoing paving work on **South Holden Road** (as of yesterday, Feb 25th) and utility work on **South Elm Street** near the railroad crossing (since Feb 23rd). If your route takes you on city streets, keep an eye out for lane closures and flaggers. Nobody wants to twist an ankle dodging traffic cones.

## Pollen Breakdown

Here's the current pollen situation. Honestly, for late February, this is a gift.

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Tree        | Low     |
| Grass       | Low     |
| Weed        | Low     |

## Your Body, Your Call

Overall, the weather itself is pretty decent for a late February workout. The biggest physical therapy concerns aren't directly from the sky, but from forced reroutes. Hitting pavement instead of softer greenway surfaces can aggravate shins, knees, and hips, especially if you're not used to it. The moderate AQI also means if you've got any underlying respiratory issues, listen to your lungs. Don't push through a tight chest. This isn't the day to try for a PR if you're sensitive to air quality.

Think before you run, look at the map, and maybe swap out that long greenway session for some laps around Country Park or hitting some loops on the still-open parts of the Downtown Greenway. Your lungs and joints will appreciate the heads-up.
