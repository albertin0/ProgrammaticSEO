Today’s a pretty solid day to hit the pavement or the trails, as long as you pay attention to your lungs and where you're stepping.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Crisp, Clear Weather:** We’ve got a clear sky and cool temperatures, making it prime weather for layering up and getting those miles in. No brutal winds or rain to contend with.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is clocking in at 66, which means it’s generally acceptable, but there’s enough fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) floating around that if your lungs are sensitive, you might notice it.
*   **Bicentennial Greenway Section Closed:** Heads up if you planned a long haul on the Bicentennial Greenway. The northernmost trestle bridge is still out for replacement between Bur-Mil Park and Strawberry Road. This isn't new news, but it's an important ongoing heads-up for runners and cyclists who rely on that section.

### Getting Out There Today

The weather gods are smiling on us today, runners. With temperatures hovering around 5.6°C (42°F) this morning and expected to climb into the 60s Fahrenheit (16°C) later, it's that sweet spot for a comfortable workout without overheating or freezing your bits off. A clear sky means you can soak up some much-needed vitamin D, though I'd still advise grabbing that SPF 30 if you're fair-skinned, because the sun doesn't care if it's cool out.

Now, about that air. Our Air Quality Index is currently sitting at 66. This falls into the "Moderate" category, largely due to fine particulate matter. For most of us, it won't be an issue, but if you’re asthmatic, have other respiratory conditions, or are just generally more sensitive, you might feel a bit of irritation, especially during high-intensity efforts. Listen to your body – it usually knows best.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Air Quality Advisory for Sensitive Groups
While the overall AQI is moderate, the presence of fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) means sensitive individuals, including children, older adults, and those with heart or lung disease, should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. If you start coughing or feeling shortness of breath, it’s time to dial it back or head inside.

### Trail Talk: Bicentennial Greenway

For those of you who love the long stretches of our greenway system, specifically the Bicentennial Greenway, remember that pesky closure near Bur-Mil Park. The northernmost trestle bridge between Bur-Mil Park and Strawberry Road is still closed for replacement. Don't be that runner who gets five miles in only to hit a "trail closed" sign and have to backtrack. Plan your route accordingly or find an alternative loop. Seriously, I've seen enough frustrated faces turn around at that spot.

### Bicentennial Greenway Detour
If your route includes the section of the Bicentennial Greenway between Bur-Mil Park and Strawberry Road, prepare for a detour or choose a different starting point. The trestle bridge replacement is an ongoing project. Check the Greensboro Parks and Rec website for potential updates, though this one has been a long time coming.

Pollen levels are delightfully low today, which is a rare treat for us allergy sufferers here in the Piedmont.

So, go enjoy that low pollen count while it lasts, because we all know what's coming. Don't forget your water, stay aware of your surroundings, and respect those closures. Happy running, Greensboro.
