Today's a pretty decent day for a run, but keep an eye on those ongoing construction detours around town.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   That glorious 11.5°C and clear skies are what we live for this time of year. Perfect running weather, no excuses.
*   Pollen is playing nice for once, sitting at a mercifully low level. Your sinuses can breathe easy.
*   However, our air quality is clocking in at a moderate 67 AQI, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. If you're sensitive, you might feel it.

## Greensboro's Grout and Grind: Watch Your Step

Alright, folks, let's talk about what's actually happening on the ground (or rather, what's *not* happening because it's torn up). While the weather's cooperating, our city's constantly under construction, and today is no exception.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Road Closures Impacting Your Route:** Heads up for anyone planning a long run or bike ride around the southwest side of town. West Greenway Drive South and Sylvan Road are currently shut down to through traffic for stormwater pipe installation. This isn't a quick fix; the closures are expected to continue daily until March 2. Don't just blindly follow your usual route there; you'll hit a wall of cones. Plan alternative paths if West Greenway Drive South is usually part of your circuit.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**AQI for the Sensitive Souls:** With the AQI at 67 due to ozone, most of us will be fine. But if you're asthmatic, have respiratory issues, or just generally feel cruddy when the air isn't pristine, maybe dial back the intensity or shorten your outdoor session. It's not "stay indoors and panic" level, but it's also not "breathe deep and feel invigorated" level for everyone. Listen to your lungs, they usually tell the truth.
</AlertBox>

Speaking of truth, the Norfolk Southern Railroad work on the South Elm Street Railroad Crossing is still ongoing, having started back on February 23. While this might primarily affect vehicle traffic, it's always worth being aware of heavy machinery and potential detours even if you're on foot. Also, West Sycamore Street remains closed for construction, expected to reopen tomorrow, February 27. So, avoid that area for your Thursday workout.

The good news is we're not dealing with any extreme weather, smoke from wildfires, or major flooding. The mild temperature is a dream for knocking out those miles without overheating or freezing. Just be aware of your surroundings, especially near those marked construction zones. A little extra planning can save you a lot of frustration when you're in the zone.
