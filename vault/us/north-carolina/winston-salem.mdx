Alright Winston-Salem, it's February, which usually means the weather's as confused as a squirrel in a crosswalk. Today? It's decent, but don't let the clear skies fool you into thinking it's totally smooth sailing out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>

*   Our air isn't exactly crisp mountain-fresh, thanks to moderate ozone levels.
*   Recent winter shenanigans have left our roads looking like a minefield of potholes.
*   Several of your go-to trails are currently under construction or experiencing detours.

</BulletList>

Look, today's weather at 11.2°C and clear skies sounds like a runner's dream on paper. And with pollen levels mercifully low, your sinuses can actually chill out for once. But before you lace up and head out the door feeling invincible, let's talk about the real world, shall we?

The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 74, with ozone being the main culprit. That's not "stay indoors and panic" territory, but it's also not "breathe deeply and feel revitalized" good. If you've got sensitive lungs or you're planning an intense, long effort, you might notice it. It’s just enough to make you feel that little bit heavier, that little bit less efficient. Don't push your max effort unless you really need to prove something to yourself (and frankly, nobody cares that much).

### Watch Your Step: Pothole Apocalypse
The city council just approved $3 million for asphalt, which tells you everything you need to know about the state of our streets. Weeks of snow, ice, and that lovely freeze-thaw cycle have turned perfectly good pavement into a patchwork of craters. If you're a road runner or cyclist, especially on side streets or less-traveled routes, keep your eyes peeled. A twisted ankle or a blown tire isn't worth shaving a few seconds off your pace.
</AlertBox>

And speaking of keeping your eyes peeled, if your plan involves hitting any of our excellent greenways, you might want to double-check their status. The Larry Little Walking Trail, for example, is currently undergoing repairs and fitness equipment improvements, which means portions might be inaccessible or messy. Same goes for Bowen-Thomas Park, where walking paths are getting an upgrade. Even sections of the future Piedmont Greenway, particularly where it connects near Salem Lake Trail, are slated for construction "in the near future," so don't be surprised by unexpected detours or unfinished sections.

The Salem Lake Trail itself, usually a reliable seven miles of dirt path bliss, hasn't had any recent official closures within the last 24 hours, but always a good idea to call the marina if you're concerned about storm damage or maintenance, especially after the winter we've had. Muddy Creek Greenway is likely fine for the most part, but with ongoing work in parks and greenways across the city, you never know what you'll encounter.

### Plan Ahead, People
Before you head out, especially for longer runs or rides on specific greenways, do a quick check on the City of Winston-Salem's Recreation & Parks website or social media. They're usually pretty good about posting updates on closures and construction. Don't rely on last month's intel.

Overall, you *can* get your workout in today, but it's not a day to zone out completely. Pay attention to the air, watch where you're going, and be prepared for minor detours. Your lungs and joints will thank you.
