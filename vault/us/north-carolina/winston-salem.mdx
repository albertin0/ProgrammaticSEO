Alright, Winston-Salem, if you're hitting the streets or trails today, it's a mixed bag, but mostly leans towards "go for it."

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** The Air Quality Index (AQI) is creeping into "moderate" territory at 69, with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) being the main culprit. If your lungs are finicky, or you're prone to respiratory issues, keep that intense workout indoors or save it for another day. Otherwise, you're probably fine.
*   **Construction is Your Constant Companion:** Good luck on some of our favorite spots. The Salem Parkway Multi-Use Path (MUP) Phase 1 construction is still very much a thing, connecting the Strollway to West Fourth Street. Expect detours and blocked-off sections, especially around the Cherry Street ramp. Also, the Larry Little Walking Trail is undergoing repairs, so watch your step for drainage work and equipment upgrades.
*   **Weather's a Winner:** Low 40s rising to low 60s, clear skies – practically perfect running weather if you layer right. No crazy winds, no rain, just pure, unadulterated cool air.
</BulletList>

Look, the air quality isn't going to kill you if you're healthy, but it's not ideal. AccuWeather even calls Sunday's air quality "Poor," so enjoy this "Fair" day while you can. But the real headache today is going to be navigating our city's perpetual state of improvement.

### Trail Updates: Dodge the Cones

Seriously, our city planners love orange cones more than a runner loves an empty stretch of asphalt. The Salem Parkway Multi-Use Path (MUP) project is still chugging along. If you planned a long run utilizing that connector between the Winston-Salem Strollway and West Fourth Street, be prepared to get creative with your route. The Cherry Street ramp? Yeah, probably blocked. Don't be that person who ignores the signs and ends up staring down a backhoe.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Chaos Near Downtown!** The Salem Parkway Multi-Use Path construction means sections connecting the Winston-Salem Strollway to West Fourth Street are impacted. Check for detours, especially around the Cherry Street ramp. Don't assume your usual route is clear.
</AlertBox>

And it's not just downtown. The Larry Little Walking Trail is getting a facelift too, with repairs to walking paths, drainage, and fitness equipment. So if you're over there, heads up for uneven surfaces and active work zones. The Twin City Ballfield Complex is also closed for improvements, so if your workout involves laps around the diamond, you're out of luck there for a few more weeks.

### Air Quality Check: Breathe Easy, Mostly

The AQI at 69 is "Moderate." The problem child is fine particulate matter (PM2.5). These tiny devils can dig deep into your lungs and aren't great for anyone over prolonged exposure, but they're especially annoying if you have asthma or other respiratory conditions. Today isn't a "stay inside and hermetically seal yourself" kind of day, but if you feel any irritation, listen to your body and cut it short. Don't push through that cough.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Know Your Body's Limits:** With moderate PM2.5 levels, sensitive individuals might experience minor symptoms. If you have respiratory issues, consider a shorter, less intense workout or move it indoors.

### Today's Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |
| Trees       | No Report |
| Grass       | No Report |
| Weeds       | No Report |

Thank goodness for small favors, the pollen count is low, so at least your sneezes won't be competing with PM2.5 for airtime.

### Stay Savvy, Winston-Salem

It's a decent day to get out there, just be smart about where you're going and how hard you're pushing it. Double-check local city alerts for unexpected closures, because things change faster than my split times on a downhill.
