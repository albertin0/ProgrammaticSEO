Alright, Winston-Salem, if you've been waiting for a decent day to actually *enjoy* moving your body outside without freezing or drowning, today's your damn day, just mind the orange cones.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   That crisp 11°C (52°F) air is practically begging you to go for a run, and with clear skies, it's hard to argue.
*   Pollen is playing nice today, which is a rare blessing for those of us who usually spend spring sneezing our way through the Salem Lake trail.
*   However, don't let the lovely weather fool you; construction is still a beast out there, disrupting some of our favorite spots.
</BulletList>

Today's the kind of day that makes you wonder if you actually live in North Carolina or some temperate paradise, at least on the surface. We've got a glorious 11.3°C, clear as a bell, and honestly, it's perfect for just about any outdoor activity you can think of. Your lungs will appreciate the low pollen count; no need to look like you just went three rounds with a dust bunny.

But, and you know there's always a "but" with Winston-Salem, the air quality isn't exactly pristine. We're clocking in at an AQI of 69, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Now, for most of us marathon-hardened folks, that's just a Tuesday. But if you've got asthma, COPD, or just generally feel like you're breathing through a wet sock on moderate days, maybe dial back the hill repeats on the Salem Creek Greenway. Ozone can be a real lung irritant, and an AQI of 69 is pushing it from "good" to "eh, could be better."

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Air Quality Alert
With an AQI of 69 and ozone as the main culprit, individuals with respiratory sensitivities might experience some irritation. Consider reducing prolonged or strenuous outdoor exertion, especially in the afternoon when ozone levels tend to be higher.

Now, let's talk about the real joy of running in our fair city: dodging construction. It seems like the entire city decided 2026 was the year of "improvements," which usually means "temporary inconvenience for everyone." The Larry Little Walking Trail is still getting a facelift with ongoing repairs to the trails and equipment. If you were planning on hitting those loops, expect some detours and possibly some muddy patches, depending on what they're tearing up. Same goes for Bowen-Thomas Park; they're laying down new 10-foot wide paths, which sounds great for future us, but current us might find sections closed.

And don't even get me started on the Salem Parkway Multi-Use Path. Phase 1 has been underway since last summer and is still chugging along. If you're near the Strollway or planning to connect downtown routes, keep an eye out for active work zones. It's not a complete shutdown, but you might find yourself doing an unexpected urban parkour routine. Also, for those who love a historical backdrop to their sweat session, Historic Bethabara is under renovation for another month or two. You'll probably see construction activity there, which might spoil your serene run through colonial history.

### Plan Your Route, Seriously.
Check the City of Winston-Salem's recreation and parks updates before heading out, especially if your usual route includes Larry Little Walking Trail, Bowen-Thomas Park, or areas around the Salem Parkway Multi-Use Path. Expect some sections to be closed or detoured.

In short, the weather's a dream, pollen's chill, but our lungs are getting a touch of ozone, and our trails are a patchwork of "under construction." Be smart, listen to your body, and don't assume that just because the sun's out, your favorite path isn't a mess.
