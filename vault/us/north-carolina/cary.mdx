Today's one of those "eh, it's okay, but check your route" kind of days for a run in Cary.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  - The air is clear and the temperature is pleasant at 12.2°C, which is a big win for outdoor activities.
  - Pollen levels are blessedly low, so your sinuses can breathe easy today.
  - Unfortunately, the air quality isn't pristine; we're sitting at a moderate AQI of 62, with Ozone being the dominant pollutant.
  - Significant portions of the popular Black Creek Greenway are still undergoing renovations and are closed, so don't just blindly head out there.
</BulletList>

## The Good, The Meh, and The "Seriously, Cary?"

Alright, Cary runners, let's talk brass tacks for your Thursday sweat session. The good news: that 12.2°C temperature with clear skies is pretty darn near perfect for hitting the pavement or trails. No extreme heat, no bone-chilling cold. And for those of us who suffer through spring, "Low" pollen is practically a holiday. Your lungs will thank you for not turning into a snot factory out there.

However, it's not all sunshine and PRs. Our Air Quality Index is hanging out at 62, which is "Moderate," and the main culprit is Ozone. For most folks, this isn't a huge deal, but if you've got sensitive lungs or asthma, you might feel it on a harder effort. Stick to a more casual pace if you're concerned, or maybe just shorten your long run a bit. Don't push it.

### Black Creek Greenway: Still a Minefield of Closures

Now, about our beloved Black Creek Greenway. You know, that beautiful stretch from Lake Crabtree down towards Bond Park? Yeah, don't count on a continuous run there. Portions are *still* under renovation. Specifically, the section between Godbold Park and Evans Road remains closed for repairs, and you'll need to detour to the Maynard Road sidewalk if you insist on passing through. And let's not forget the sections near Livingstone Drive and Weston Parkway that have been undergoing work and are slated to reopen "this spring" – which is, well, *now*. So, check the Town of Cary's greenway detour page before you head out, unless you enjoy unexpected detours and construction fences ruining your flow. Seriously, save yourself the frustration.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Ozone Alert:** With an AQI of 62 and Ozone as the dominant pollutant, individuals sensitive to air pollution should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Maybe scale back that tempo run.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Black Creek Greenway Partial Closures:** Significant sections of the Black Creek Greenway are still under renovation. Expect closures and detours, especially between Godbold Park and Evans Road, and segments near Livingstone Drive and Weston Parkway. Always check the Town of Cary's official greenway detour page before planning your route.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Keep an Eye on the Skies:** While it's clear right now, forecasts for today mentioned a "light rain during the day" and a 75% chance of rain. Cary weather can be fickle, so maybe grab a waterproof vest, just in case.

Remember to stay hydrated, be aware of your surroundings, and don't assume your usual route is clear, especially on those greenways.
