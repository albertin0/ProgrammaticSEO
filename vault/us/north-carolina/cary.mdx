Another clear, brisk morning in Cary, but don't let that sunshine fool you into thinking it's an automatically great day for a PR attempt. The air quality is doing its usual dance, and our beloved greenways are still a minefield of construction.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

### Why today isn't *quite* the day:

<BulletList>
*   **AQI's doing its thing again.** While the number might look "moderate" on some scales at 77, the dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm). AccuWeather's straight talk labels anything between 50-99 as "Poor" and warns it's "unhealthy for sensitive groups." Translation: if you've got lungs, they'll notice, especially during heavy exertion.
*   **It's still darn cold out there.** At 5.9°C (that's about 42°F for those still stuck on Fahrenheit), you'll need to layer up properly, especially for those early miles. Your joints will thank you for not shocking them with a short-sleeved sprint.
*   **Black Creek Greenway remains a construction zone.** Seriously, this project feels like it's going for a world record. Portions of the Black Creek Greenway between Godbold Park and Evans Road are still closed for repairs, with detours sending you onto Maynard Road's sidewalk. Expect this to continue, as major renovations are ongoing to widen and realign sections, with an estimated completion in 2027.

## Environmental Breakdown

The weather forecast for Cary today is clear with temperatures expected to rise to about 15°C (59°F) later in the day, with light and variable winds. However, don't forget that chilly start. There are no severe weather advisories or warnings currently active for Cary, which is a small mercy.

### Air Quality

| AQI | Dominant Pollutant | Health Implications |
|---|---|---|
| 77 | Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) | Moderate overall, but "Poor" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups" according to some local reports. |

<AlertBox type="warning">
That AQI of 77 isn't just a number. Fine particulate matter can get deep into your lungs and bloodstream, potentially causing respiratory issues, aggravating asthma, and impacting your heart, especially with prolonged exposure. If you have any kind of respiratory sensitivity, consider dialing back that outdoor effort or taking it inside today. Even healthy individuals might feel some irritation.

### Pollen Report

| Pollutant   | Level |
|-------------|-------|
| Tree Pollen | Low   |
| Grass Pollen| Low   |
| Weed Pollen | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are thankfully low across the board today. Breathe easy on that front.

## Workout Hazards & Conditions

### Greenways & Trails

As mentioned, the **Black Creek Greenway** continues to be a headache for local runners. The section between Godbold Park and Evans Road is still closed for ongoing repairs and renovations. This isn't just a quick patch job; the Town of Cary is undertaking a multi-phase project to widen the trail, improve drainage, and realign flood-prone sections, aiming for completion in 2027. You'll be detoured onto the Maynard Road sidewalk, which, let's be honest, isn't quite the same as a nice wide greenway.

<AlertBox type="info">
If you're planning a long run through areas usually connected by Black Creek Greenway, map out your detours in advance. Be extra vigilant on shared sidewalks and roads, and be courteous to pedestrians. Also, keep an eye out for other greenway resurfacing projects planned for 2026, including Bishops Gate Greenway and North Cary Park, which will likely bring more intermittent closures when temperatures allow for asphalt work.

### Other Notes

No recent news from the last 24 hours indicates any new, sudden hazards like wildfires, high winds, or widespread flooding directly impacting Cary. It's mostly the existing conditions and ongoing projects you need to contend with. Dress warm, listen to your body (especially those lungs), and try to find a less-trafficked section of trail if you're concerned about the air. Or, you know, hit one of the 24/7 gyms like Workout Anytime or Planet Fitness.
