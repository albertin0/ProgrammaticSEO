Alright, Cary, you're looking at one of those classic "looks can be deceiving" kind of days.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  *   The weather is clear and that 13.6°C (56.5°F) feels pretty decent for knocking out some miles. Your joints will thank you for not freezing them off.
  *   Pollen count is finally playing nice, staying low. No excuses for sounding like a dying goose after a mile today.
  *   However, that AQI is sitting at 81. Don't let "moderate" fool you; with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) as the dominant pollutant, your lungs are still doing extra work if you push it. This isn't just a number; it's tiny irritants floating around from those "more-than-anticipated prescribed/agricultural burns" southwest of us. So much for fresh air.

### Your Daily Dose of Reality

Today's one of those days where the sky might be blue, but the air is a bit… crunchy. We're sitting in the "Moderate" zone for air quality, which for most folks just means "eh, you'll be fine." But if you're like me, prone to feeling it in your chest after a tempo run, or if you've got any kind of respiratory issues, that fine particulate matter is going to be a nuisance. Think of it as tiny dust bunnies trying to set up camp in your airways. The NC State Air Quality Portal noted elevated PM2.5 levels yesterday from burns to our southwest, and that stuff doesn't just vanish overnight.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **AQI 81, Dominated by PM2.5:** "Moderate" air quality isn't an excuse to go all out. If you're sensitive, or planning a high-intensity session, consider dialing it back or sticking to indoor workouts. Your lungs don't need the extra challenge.

On the trail front, there's always something going on. If you're heading to the American Tobacco Trail, specifically the section cutting through Chatham County, be aware that bridge repairs are underway from mid-February through March. The good news is the trail *will remain open*, but keep your head on a swivel. You never know what equipment or materials might be near the trail as crews work.

  **American Tobacco Trail Bridge Repairs:** The ATT is open for business, but expect crews doing bridge repairs in the Chatham County sections until the end of March. Stay alert, watch your footing, and give workers their space.

If your route involves any roads, the Town of Cary has a bunch of water utility work happening. Bright Beginnings Way, near NC 55, is closed from 9 AM to 3 PM for water connection work, which started yesterday. So if your run typically takes you that way, find an alternate. Nobody likes an unexpected detour cutting into their pace.

And for those who like to venture slightly out of Cary's immediate greenways, heads up: Raleigh has ongoing closures. The Crabtree Creek Trail at Umstead State Park is *still* closed for a bridge replacement. Don't try to go north into Umstead from the Crabtree Creek Trail there; it's barricaded for a reason, and Ebenezer Church Road is not your friend as a pedestrian.

Clear skies don't automatically mean clear sailing for your run, folks. Listen to your body, especially your lungs, and stay safe out there.
