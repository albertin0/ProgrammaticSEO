Don't let that pleasant, mild breeze fool you completely, Raleigh. Today is a classic "almost perfect, but not quite" kind of day for your outdoor workout.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That beautiful 13.4°C (56°F) temperature and clear sky? Your joints and mood will absolutely thrive. Finally, a break from either sweating through your shoes or trying to run on ice.
*   However, your lungs might not be singing the same tune. The Air Quality Index is hovering at a moderate 77, with inhalable particulate matter (&lt;10µm) being the dominant pollutant. Seems those "controlled" burns down in Georgia and South Carolina are still sending their hazy regards our way.
*   If you're a creature of habit on the greenways, be prepared for some detours or full stops. Raleigh's always under construction, and our trails are no exception.

## Today's Outdoor Reality Check

Look, the weather itself is a gift after the unpredictable slop we've had. This is the kind of day you *want* to hit the pavement or the trails. But before you lace up and sprint out the door thinking it's all sunshine and roses, let's talk about the fine print.

That moderate AQI isn't going to kill you, but it's not ideal for pushing hard, especially if you're prone to respiratory issues. Inhalable particulate matter means tiny bits floating around that can get into your lungs. Not exactly what you want when you're sucking wind trying to shave seconds off your usual loop. Take it down a notch, or at least be aware that you might feel a bit more drag than usual.

### Trail Updates and Permanent Annoyances

If your go-to is the Crabtree Creek Trail, and you're planning a long excursion into William B. Umstead State Park via the Turkey Creek Trail, you're out of luck. That section of Turkey Creek Trail has been shut down for a bridge replacement since February 2024 and won't reopen until *December 31, 2026*. So, no heading north into Umstead from Crabtree Creek at mile marker 16.75 for a good long while. Plan those routes.

And just a heads-up for future planning: the Neuse River Trail is about to get hit with some significant sewer improvement closures starting March 9th. Some of those sections, like the one north of the Skycrest Pedestrian Bridge to River Bend Park, won't even have a detour. So, if you're eyeing long mileage on the Neuse, start scouting alternate routes *now*.

We've also got ongoing construction on Atlantic Avenue and Lake Boone Trail that can impact pedestrian and bike traffic. Keep your head on a swivel if you're running or riding in those areas; distracted drivers and shifting lanes are a constant menace.

<AlertBox type="warning">
The moderate AQI of 77, driven by inhalable particulate matter, suggests that sensitive groups (asthmatics, elderly, children) should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Even for healthy individuals, listen to your body and don't push for maximum effort today.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
The Turkey Creek Trail section connecting Crabtree Creek Trail into Umstead State Park is *closed for over a year* for bridge replacement. Do not attempt to use this route to enter Umstead from Crabtree Creek.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
Always prioritize personal safety on Raleigh's greenways. There have been reports of concerning incidents in the past (like flashings on Crabtree Valley Trail). Consider using the buddy system, carry your phone, and be acutely aware of your surroundings. Report anything suspicious to 911. Your workout isn't worth feeling unsafe.
