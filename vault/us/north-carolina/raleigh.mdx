Look, if you like running in a misty, slightly smoky haze while dodging construction, today's your day. Otherwise, maybe stick to the treadmill.

<BulletList>
*   Rain, and a lot of it, is expected throughout the day, making surfaces slick and visibility tricky.
*   Air quality is moderate at an AQI of 75, but fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is elevated due to prescribed burns southwest of us, so don't be surprised if the air feels heavier than that number suggests.
*   Ongoing construction projects mean sections of our beloved greenways and city streets are either closed or require careful navigation.

## The Rundown

Alright, Raleigh, let's talk about hitting the pavement or trails today. That 13.4°C (about 56°F) temperature might look inviting, but don't let it fool you. The forecast is calling for a 95% chance of rain today. So unless you've got GORE-TEX head-to-toe and don't mind a soggy slog, you might want to rethink your outdoor plans. Wet leaves, slick asphalt, and muddy patches are a recipe for twisted ankles and bruised egos.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch Your Step: Wet Conditions Ahead

With heavy rain expected, trails will be slick, and puddles will be plentiful. Even our well-maintained greenways like the **Crabtree Creek Trail** could be treacherous, especially sections with recent streambank restoration closures near Lassiter Mill Road, where detours might be less-than-ideal sidewalks. Slow down, shorten your stride, and consider road shoes for better grip if you insist on heading out.

Then there's the air. The provided AQI is 75, which is "Moderate." But hold your horses. The North Carolina Division of Air Quality mentioned yesterday that fine particulate levels (PM2.5) are "significantly elevated" across the Charlotte-to-Raleigh corridor thanks to agricultural and prescribed burns down south. This means that while the general number might not scream "stay inside," if you're sensitive to air pollution, you're likely to feel it. AccuWeather even flagged today as "Poor" and "Unhealthy for sensitive groups" with an AQI of 102 at one point. So, if you've got asthma or are just generally prone to that post-run cough, take heed.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Breathe Easy (If You Can)

Despite the "Moderate" AQI of 75, elevated particulate matter from distant burns is impacting our air quality. Sensitive groups should limit outdoor activity. If you start feeling symptoms like difficulty breathing or throat irritation, cut your workout short and head indoors.

Finally, the never-ending symphony of Raleigh construction continues. If your usual route takes you along the **Neuse River Trail**, be aware that between mile markers 22 and 23.25 (Auburn Knightdale Rd and Battle Bridge Rd), there are periodic stoppages due to the Complete 540 project. While a temporary detour is usually in place, navigating it in the rain with reduced visibility is just adding unnecessary layers of annoyance and risk. Also, keep an eye out for work on Atlantic Avenue, Blue Ridge Road, and various sidewalk projects that can pop up and throw a wrench in your flow.

### Plan Your Route, Check for Closures

Always check the City of Raleigh's Parks and Transportation project pages before you head out. Sections of trails like Crabtree Creek, Turkey Creek (at Umstead), and the Neuse River Trail are impacted by ongoing work. Knowing what to expect means less frustration and more miles.
