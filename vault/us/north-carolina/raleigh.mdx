It's a mixed bag out there today, Raleigh, so don't just blindly hit the pavement.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **The Good News (Your Nose Will Thank You):** Pollen is thankfully *low* today. So, for once, your outdoor run won't feel like a battle against seasonal allergies. Enjoy that!
*   **The Bad News (Your Lungs Might Not):** While the air quality *looks* okay at a 55 AQI, the dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm). That stuff gets deep into your lungs. You'll feel it if you're pushing hard, especially with speed work or long distances. Think twice before trying to set a PR today.
*   **The "Are You Kidding Me?!" News (Your Routes Are Rerouted):** Multiple greenway sections are closed, and not just the little ones. If your go-to is the **Neuse River Greenway**, a significant stretch between Buffaloe Road and Anderson Point Park is *closed until further notice* due to an "ongoing investigation". Don't go trying to skirt around it – the city means it. There are also future closures planned for sewer work and the I-540 extension, so stay vigilant with city alerts. The Crabtree Creek Trail also has a section closed for streambank restoration through June. Seriously, check the map before you leave.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### AQI: Moderate is Not "Go Wild"
An AQI of 55 with fine particulate matter as the culprit means your lungs are working harder to filter tiny pollutants. If you have any respiratory sensitivities (asthma, bronchitis, or you just don't like hacking up a lung after your run), consider scaling back your intensity or keeping it shorter. This isn't the day to prove your toughness by breathing in micro-debris. Listen to your body, not your ego.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Seriously, Respect the Trail Closures
The Neuse River Greenway closure, particularly the section between Buffaloe Road and Anderson Point Park, is a legitimate safety issue. Same goes for the Crabtree Creek Trail closure near Lassiter Mill Road. These aren't suggestions; they're *closed*. Detours exist for some sections, but don't assume they're as runnable or safe as the actual greenway. Trying to barrel through a closed section is how you end up twisted up or, worse, interfering with whatever "ongoing investigation" is happening. You've been warned.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Construction Chaos
Raleigh seems to be in a perpetual state of road construction, and today is no different. You'll find ongoing projects on Atlantic Avenue, Lake Boone Trail, and Blue Ridge Road, among others. Expect temporary lane closures and traffic shifts. If you're running on sidewalks near these areas, stay alert. Drivers are already distracted; don't give them another reason to not see you. Make eye contact, assume they don't see you, and wear bright colors. Your fluorescent shorts are your best friend.
</AlertBox>

Overall, the weather is decent for a workout, but you've got to be smart. Plan your route around closures, scale back your intensity if your lungs feel it, and be hyper-aware around construction. Nobody wants to visit me in the clinic for an avoidable injury.
