Raleigh, today's a mixed bag for outdoor workouts: clear skies but enough ongoing projects to reroute even the most dedicated among us.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>

*   Our air quality, while not terrible, is sitting squarely in the "moderate" zone due to fine particulate matter. So, if you've got finicky lungs, take note.
*   Construction season is in full swing, turning some of our favorite greenway stretches into a maze of detours and outright closures. Plan your route, or risk a longer day than intended.
*   The weather itself is a runner's dream right now: cool, clear, and prime for breaking a sweat without melting.

## The Air You Breathe

Let's talk about the invisible stuff. Your environmental data tells us the Air Quality Index (AQI) is at 68, with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) being the dominant pollutant. This nudges us firmly into the "Moderate" category. What does that mean for your run along the Capital Area Greenway? It means that for most folks, it's probably fine, but if you're part of the sensitive crowd – asthmatics, people with respiratory conditions, or even just those with seasonal allergies – you might feel it. Those tiny particles can get deep into your lungs and cause some irritation. So, while it's not "stay indoors and seal the windows" bad, it's definitely "listen to your body" territory.

### Today's Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Ragweed     | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are mercifully low across the board. Enjoy that, because we all know what's coming.

## Ground Hazards: Raleigh's Perpetual Construction Project

Ah, Raleigh. The city that's always building something. This means our beloved trails often bear the brunt of progress.

<AlertBox type="warning">

**Neuse River Trail Closures:** If you're planning a long run on the Neuse, be advised. A section between mile markers 22 and 23.25, roughly between Auburn Knightdale Rd and Battle Bridge Rd, is undergoing a sewer improvement project and will have periodic stoppages or temporary detour trails through September 2028. Don't count on a clear path; check for updates or be ready to reroute on the fly. More localized closures on the Neuse are also on the horizon for early and mid-March, but those aren't impacting us *today*.

</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">

**Umstead Park Access Restricted:** If Umstead is your jam, specifically the Turkey Creek Trail, a section is currently closed for a bridge replacement. This means you won't be able to access Umstead State Park by heading north on the Turkey Creek Trail from the Crabtree Creek Trail. Don't ignore those signs; a closed trail is closed for a reason, and usually that reason involves heavy machinery or a gaping hole in the ground.

</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">

**Park & Field Closures:** Strickland Road Neighborhood Park and Leesville Community Park are completely closed for construction through early 2026. Also, the Mountain Bike Trail at Forest Ridge Park is currently closed. Planning a casual stroll at Pullen Park? Be aware that Pullen Park Amusements are fully closed until March 31st for a shoreline project. The aquatic center and tennis courts are still open, but don't expect a carousel ride after your swim.

## The Good News

Today's temperature is sitting at a crisp 6.2°C (43°F) and topping out around 16°C (60°F) later, under clear skies. It's perfect running weather – cool enough to push without overheating, but warm enough to thaw out quickly. Just make sure you layer up, especially for those early morning miles.

## Your Move, Raleigh

So, what's the takeaway? The air quality isn't perfect, and our city's a constant construction zone, but the weather is fantastic. If you're hitting the pavement, listen to your lungs, double-check those greenway alerts, and be flexible with your route. Otherwise, enjoy the miles.
