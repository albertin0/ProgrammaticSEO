Alright, Raleigh, if you can dodge a few construction cones and reroute your long run, today's not half bad for getting outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Air quality is sitting at a 'moderate' 64 AQI thanks to ozone, so if you're sensitive, maybe dial back the intensity.
*   The Neuse River Greenway is still a patchwork of "upcoming" and "ongoing" closures, making uninterrupted long runs a challenge, especially north of the Skycrest Pedestrian Bridge.
*   Don't even think about a clear run on the Crabtree Creek Trail near Lassiter Mill Road; that streambank restoration has it shut down through June, with detours that aren't exactly runner-friendly.
</BulletList>

## Today's Environmental Breakdown

| Pollutant          | Level  | AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------------- | :----- | :-- | :----------------- |
| Pollen             | Low    | -   | -                  |
| Air Quality Index  | Moderate | 64  | Ozone              |

## The Good, The Bad, and The Orange Cones

**The Good:** We've got clear skies and a comfortable 11.9°C (that's about 53°F for those of us not on the metric system). The kind of weather where you actually *want* to be outside. Plus, pollen is thankfully low, so your sinuses can take a much-needed break from the usual Raleigh spring assault. No surprise high winds or torrential downpours making things extra miserable either.

**The Not-So-Good (and potentially infuriating):** While the air itself isn't terrible, that moderate AQI for ozone means if you're hitting it hard, your lungs might notice. Maybe skip the tempo run and opt for an easy effort.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Ozone Levels
With an AQI of 64 driven by ozone, individuals with respiratory sensitivities should consider reducing prolonged outdoor exertion. It's not a "stay inside" day, but it's definitely a "listen to your body" day.
</AlertBox>

Now, for the real buzzkill for anyone trying to actually *run* somewhere: the construction and trail closures. The City of Oaks might be green, but lately, it's also a vibrant shade of orange with all the cones and detour signs.

The **Neuse River Greenway Trail** continues its saga of long-term disruptions. While some major closures north of the Skycrest Pedestrian Bridge and between the WRAL Soccer Park and Horseshoe Farm Nature Preserve don't officially kick off until early or mid-March, there are still periodic stoppages and ongoing work related to the Complete 540 project between Auburn Knightdale Rd and Battle Bridge Rd that started way back in October 2025 and aren't finishing until late 2028. They've *promised* temporary detours in that specific section, but "temporary" rarely means "smooth sailing."

And let's talk about the **Crabtree Creek Trail**. A significant section between Lassiter Mill Road and Rothgeb Drive is fully closed until June 30, 2026, for some streambank restoration. The proposed detour involves sidewalks along Lassiter Mill Road and Marlowe Road – but seriously, Marlowe Road has no sidewalks. Expect some sketchy road running if you try to navigate that one. If you were planning to head north into Umstead State Park via the **Turkey Creek Trail**, forget about it; there's a bridge replacement project at Mile Marker 16.75 that's blocking that access point.

Road projects like the **Blue Ridge Road Bike-Ped Project**, **Atlantic Avenue Improvement Project**, and **Lake Boone Trail Improvement Project** are also ongoing, meaning intermittent lane closures and general vehicular headaches if you're sharing the road. Even **Pullen Park Amusements** are closed until the end of March for a shoreline project, though the Aquatic Center and tennis courts are still open.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Major Trail Closures: Expect Disruptions!
Multiple key greenway sections are impacted by long-term construction.
*   **Crabtree Creek Trail (Lassiter Mill to Rothgeb Drive):** CLOSED through June 30, 2026. Detour is less than ideal.
*   **Turkey Creek Trail (Umstead State Park access):** CLOSED at Mile Marker 16.75 for bridge work, blocking northbound entry into Umstead from Crabtree Creek.
*   **Neuse River Greenway:** Expect intermittent stoppages and ongoing construction related to the Complete 540 project (MM 22-23.25) through 2028. Look for temporary detours.

### General Construction Awareness
Keep an eye out for active construction on local roads like Blue Ridge Road, Atlantic Avenue, and Lake Boone Trail. Expect lane closures and potential delays if your route includes these areas.
