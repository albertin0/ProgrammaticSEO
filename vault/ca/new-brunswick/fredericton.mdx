It's a "bundle up and watch your step" kind of evening, Fredericton. Not terrible, but far from perfect.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Temperatures are hovering just above freezing, but with that wind chill, it's going to feel colder than the 1.3°C actual. Factor in the clear skies tonight, and any lingering moisture from earlier in the day could freeze solid, making those shaded spots prime territory for black ice.
*   Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 68, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While Environment Canada says the general population can enjoy usual outdoor activities, other reports suggest sensitive groups might experience minor symptoms from prolonged exposure. Don't push it if your lungs are feeling it.
*   Pollen is blissfully low, so at least you won't be snot-running *and* battling icy sidewalks.

## Today's Rundown

Looks like Fredericton is getting a relatively clear evening, which means better visibility but also efficient heat loss. That 1.3°C temperature might sound mild, but the forecast mentioned a wind chill bringing it down to -8 this afternoon, and it's not getting warmer overnight. That's enough to bite at exposed skin and turn any damp patches into treacherous ice. Whether you're hitting the Bill Thorpe Walking Bridge or weaving through the residential streets, assume every shadow holds a potential slip hazard.

### Ice Alert: Watch Your Step!
With temperatures hovering around freezing and dropping further tonight, keep an eye out for icy patches, especially in shaded areas or on less-travelled sidewalks and trails. A good pair of trail shoes with decent grip isn't a suggestion, it's a requirement if you value your knees.

The air quality, with an AQI of 68, is in the moderate range. Ozone, the main culprit today, can be irritating for anyone with respiratory sensitivities. If you're generally robust, you'll probably be fine, but if you have asthma or other lung issues, maybe dial back the intensity. No need to set new personal bests when you're sucking in less-than-stellar air.

### Moderate Air Quality Reminder
An AQI of 68 means the air quality is generally acceptable for most individuals, but if you're sensitive to pollutants, consider adjusting your workout plan. Listen to your body – it's usually smarter than your training log.

Now, looking ahead, if your weekend plans involve running downtown, be aware that a section of Regent Street is closing this weekend (starting February 27th) to remove a crane near the Ron & Erma Hawkes Centre for the Arts. It's not today, but it'll impact your flow if you're not paying attention this weekend. Always check local road closures before planning your long runs.
