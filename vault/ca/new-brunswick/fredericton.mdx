Look, if you're expecting balmy breezes and perfect conditions, you picked the wrong time of year in Fredericton, but if you dress smart, you can still get out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   It's a frosty -2.8°C out there with clear skies, which means any moisture on the ground isn't just cold, it's probably frozen solid. Watch your step.
*   The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "moderate" 75, with ozone being the main culprit, so if you're sensitive, maybe don't go for a PR today.
*   Pollen is blessedly low, a small win for those of us who suffer through spring with perpetually stuffed sinuses.

Alright, Fredericton, let's be real. It's February 26th. You know what that means. It's cold enough to freeze the snot right out of your nose, and while the skies are clear right now, don't let that fool you. The ground is still a sheet of ice in patches, especially in those shady spots and along the river. I’ve seen enough people take tumbles on what *looked* like dry pavement around the Bill Thorpe Walking Bridge to know better. Assume black ice is everywhere until proven otherwise.

The air quality, at a moderate 75, isn't a catastrophe, but it's not sparkling fresh either. Ozone being the dominant pollutant at this time of year is a bit of a head-scratcher, but the bottom line is, if you're prone to lung irritation, take it easy. A hard interval session might not be the smartest move. Stick to a comfortable pace where you're not gasping for breath, particularly if you're hitting the exposed parts of the trails like the ones along the Saint John River, where that cold, ozone-laced air can really hit you.

### Ice is the Enemy, Always
Even with clear conditions, residual moisture from previous days and overnight freezing means ice patches are a guarantee, especially on less-trafficked paths or shaded areas of the city trail network. Consider microspikes or at least shoes with aggressive tread. A fall on black ice means a trip to the ER for a wrist or hip fracture, and nobody wants that.

### Dress for Success (and Survival)
Layers are your friend, folks. You might start off feeling chilly, but you'll warm up fast. Wicking base layers are non-negotiable. Don't forget insulated gloves, a hat that covers your ears, and a neck gaiter you can pull up over your face if that cold wind starts to bite, especially when you're out near the river or on the exposed sections of the Fredericton Trail System.

Construction-wise, while the big projects for 2026 are still being announced this spring, and the Gibson Trail bridge isn't closing until May, always keep an eye out for unexpected detours or maintenance. The city does a decent job with updates, but it's Fredericton; things pop up. For today, your biggest enemy isn't a construction cone, it's likely a hidden sheet of ice and that moderately polluted, frigid air. Keep your head up, watch your footing, and stay safe out there.
