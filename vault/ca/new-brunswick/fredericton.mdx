It's cold out there, Fredericton. Bundle up or stay inside, because while the skies are clear, your lungs and joints are going to feel that bite.

  <li>The mercury is dipping to -10.3°C, which isn't just "chilly," it's "your face might freeze if you look at it wrong" cold.</li>
  <li>AQI is sitting at a "moderate" 71, mostly due to fine particulate matter. Not awful, but combined with the cold, your lungs are working overtime.</li>
  <li>News from yesterday evening highlighted ongoing construction near the Westmorland Street Bridge, meaning potential detours or less-than-ideal footing if you're trying to get a scenic run in along the riverfront trail.</li>

## Cold Weather: Your Nemesis

Look, I love a good winter run as much as the next lunatic, but -10.3°C is no joke. The clear skies might look inviting from your window, but step outside and that dry, cold air will smack you in the face. It’s hard on the lungs, especially if you’re pushing the pace. Think about layering up, not just for warmth, but to create a barrier against that frigid air. And for the love of all that is holy, cover your ears and hands. Frostbite isn't a badge of honor; it's just poor planning.

### Air Quality & Your Lungs

| Pollutant Type       | Level | Impact                               |
| :------------------- | :---- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Pollen**           | Low   | Minimal                               |
| **AQI**              | 71    | Moderate, Fine Particulate Matter    |

An AQI of 71 with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant means it's not terrible, but it's certainly not pristine air either. Combine that with the low temperature, and your respiratory system is getting a double whammy. If you’re usually sensitive, or have any underlying conditions like asthma, today might be the day for a treadmill session. Don't be a hero and risk an asthma attack just to say you "got your run in."

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Watch for Ice, Especially on Shaded Sections:** While the main trails like the Gibson Trail or the Fredericton North Riverfront Trail are usually well-maintained, side paths and shaded areas, especially underpasses or spots where snowmelt refreezes, will be slick. One wrong step and you're buying a one-way ticket to a sprained ankle or worse. Slow down and watch your footing.

## Trail Conditions & Obstacles

The city crews do a decent job, but they can't be everywhere. Yesterday's reports about the ongoing work near the Westmorland Street Bridge are a good reminder that not all of your usual routes are guaranteed clear sailing. If you're planning on a long run connecting the north and south side trails, factor in potential detours or bottlenecks around that area. Don't be surprised if you have to hop over a snowdrift or two on less-frequented sections.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Extreme Cold Advisory for Exposed Skin:** At -10.3°C, especially with any wind chill, exposed skin can be at risk of frostnip or even frostbite surprisingly quickly. If you're not fully covered, reconsider your outdoor activity. Your skin isn't tougher than Mother Nature.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Hydrate, Even When It's Cold:** You might not feel as thirsty, but the dry, cold air can still dehydrate you. Bring a water bottle and keep sipping. Your body needs it to keep everything running, especially when it's working harder to stay warm.
</AlertBox>

All in all, today's workout is for the committed, the truly hardy, or those who own fantastic cold-weather gear. If you're heading out, prioritize warmth and safety over speed. And seriously, cover your face.
