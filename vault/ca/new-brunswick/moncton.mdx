Alright, Moncton, listen up.

Today's clear skies might tempt you, but don't be fooled by the post-blizzard landscape; it's still a minefield out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Snow and Ice, Everywhere:** Just two days ago, Moncton was buried under 20-30 cm of snow and battered by winds up to 90 km/h from a Nor'easter. While the *storm* is over, the *aftermath* isn't. Expect icy patches, uneven snow cover, and slush, especially on less-trafficked routes.
*   **Chilly, But Not Arctic (Yet):** Current temps hover around -2.3°C, which feels almost balmy compared to the recent deep freeze. However, the forecast indicates temperatures could dip to -10°C today, and wind chill on exposed areas will make it feel colder.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** Your lungs aren't getting a free pass either. The AQI is sitting at a moderate 72, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not a red alert, but for sensitive folks, it's enough to notice.

## The Rundown: Your Moncton Workout Safety Guide

So, it's Thursday, February 26, and after Monday's little "atmospheric event," you're probably itching to get out. I get it. Cabin fever is real. But before you lace up those worn-out trail shoes and hit the Riverfront Park Trail, let's have a dose of reality.

### Weather Whiplash & Lingering Snow
The official Environment Canada winter storm warnings for Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, which predicted 20 to 30 cm of snow and wind gusts up to 90 km/h, expired Tuesday morning. AccuWeather even claims "NO WARNINGS OR ADVISORIES IN EFFECT AT 10:40AM" for today. Great. Except, 25 centimetres of snow doesn't just *vanish* because a warning ends.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Black Ice is Your Nemesis:** With temperatures hovering around freezing and fluctuating, any melted snow will refreeze. Expect hidden patches of black ice on sidewalks, shaded trails, and underpasses. The Riverfront Park Trail, especially near the Gunningsville Bridge, can be particularly slick. Don't be a hero; assume every damp patch is ice.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Uneven Terrain:** That glorious 20-30 cm of snow we got isn't evenly distributed. You'll find cleared paths next to knee-deep drifts. This is an ankle-sprain waiting to happen. Stick to well-plowed areas, or bring your traction devices if you're venturing off the beaten path.
</AlertBox>

### Air Quality: Just Okay
The provided data shows an AQI of 72, which Environment Canada classifies as "Moderate." The dominant pollutant is Ozone. This isn't ideal for peak performance, especially if you have any respiratory sensitivities. While Environment Canada's Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) for Moncton currently forecasts a "Low Risk" (2-3), an AQI of 72 is on the higher end of moderate.

| Overall     | Low   |

Pollen is low, so at least your sniffles won't be from allergies.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress in Layers, Dummy:** It’s -2.3°C out there, and that's before any wind chill from the residual breeze. Dress in layers, wear a hat and gloves, and consider a neck gaiter. Hypothermia is no joke, and frostbite on exposed skin can happen faster than you think, especially when you factor in wind.
</AlertBox>

In short: Today's run isn't a PR day; it's a "don't break yourself" day. Be smart, be safe, and remember that treadmill inside is looking pretty appealing compared to a trip to the ER.
