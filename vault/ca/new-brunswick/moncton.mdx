Alright, Moncton, you wanna run today? It’s a maybe, but tread carefully.

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky out your window is nice, but don't forget the beatdown Mother Nature gave us earlier this week. We just dug out from ~25 cm of snow and some nasty winds on Monday, with another 5 cm falling last night. That means what isn't slush is probably ice. Your ankles are already screaming.
*   AQI's sitting at 75 with Ozone taking the lead. It's not a lung-buster, but if you're sensitive, you might feel it more than usual. The rest of us are probably fine, but maybe don't go for a new personal best today.
*   Pollen is low, so at least your nose won't be joining the protest.
</BulletList>

Look, the mercury is finally above freezing at 2.1°C, which feels like a heatwave after the last few days. The air is clear, which is a blessing after the blowing snow we dealt with. But don't let that fool you. Just because the sun's out doesn't mean the ground's magically thawed and perfectly grippy. That heavy snowfall from Monday, and the fresh dusting from last night, means any unplowed path or side trail is a minefield of icy patches and deep, ankle-twisting slush.

If you're heading out to hit the trails at **Mapleton Park**, expect a mixed bag. The main paths might be cleared, but venture off them at your own peril. Those shaded spots? They're holding onto ice like it's gold. Same goes for the sidewalks around town; the plows get the roads, but those residential sidewalks are often an afterthought.

### Icy Underfoot!
Recent heavy snow and fluctuating temperatures mean ice is likely lurking under any remaining snow or slush, especially on untreated paths and trails. Proceed with extreme caution. Your pride (and your tibia) will thank you.

### Gear Up Smart
Dress in layers, even if it feels mild. That wind chill can still bite, especially if you're sweating. More importantly, grab those microspikes or a pair of shoes with serious tread. If you don't have them, consider sticking to well-salted areas or hitting the treadmill. Nobody wants to explain a broken wrist to their boss.

### AQI: Moderate, Not Terrible
At 75 with ozone, the Air Quality Index is in the "moderate" zone. Most of you won't notice a thing, but if you have asthma or other respiratory issues, maybe take it down a notch. Listen to your body, not that voice telling you to push harder.
</AlertBox>

So, can you run today? Yeah, probably. But be smart about it. Pick your route carefully, watch your footing like a hawk, and don't assume every surface is clear. This isn't prime running weather, it's just Moncton doing its best impression of spring in late February.
