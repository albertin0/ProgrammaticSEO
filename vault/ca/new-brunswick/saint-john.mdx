Look, it's brutally cold out there today, but if you layer up and watch your step, you can still get your miles in.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Frigid Air & Wind Chill:** The mercury is sitting at -6.7°C, but with the wind, it feels more like -11°C. That's face-numbing weather, folks.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** Despite the clear skies, the AQI is at 79, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. This means it's not ideal for all-out efforts, especially if you've got sensitive lungs.
*   **Lingering Ice Hazards:** After the recent Atlantic Canada blizzard that hit just a few days ago, even with clearer weather, expect patches of black ice and packed snow, particularly on less-trafficked trails and shaded areas.

## The Rundown

Alright, Saint John, it's one of those days where you really have to earn that post-run coffee. The sky might be clear, but don't let that trick you into thinking it's a stroll in the park.

That -6.7°C temperature, feeling like -11°C, is no joke. Frostbite can set in faster than you think, especially on exposed skin. Layers are your best friend, and seriously, consider a balaclava or neck gaiter. Your lungs will thank you.

Then there's the air quality. An AQI of 79, driven by Ozone, puts us firmly in the "Moderate" category. For most of you, it's probably fine for a steady run, but if you're prone to respiratory issues or you're planning a tempo workout, you might want to ease off the gas. Listen to your body; it's not trying to win an Olympic medal out there today.

And let's talk about the ground beneath your feet. While the major snowfall from earlier this week has likely been cleared from main roads, trails are a different beast. Places like Rockwood Park, especially around Lily Lake and those winding paths that don't see direct sunlight, are prime spots for treacherous black ice. You know the kind – the invisible stuff that sends you flying. Assume everything is slick until proven otherwise. A slip and fall in these temperatures can turn a minor sprain into a much bigger headache when you're also dealing with the cold.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Extreme Cold Warning: Exposed Skin at Risk!
With temperatures feeling like -11°C, exposed skin can be at risk of frostbite in a short amount of time. Cover up, seriously. Hats, gloves, and a face covering are non-negotiable.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch Your Step – Ice is the Enemy
Even if it looks clear, expect black ice. Take smaller, more deliberate steps, especially on bridges, boardwalks, and shaded sections of trails. Microspikes or Yaktrax are your best friend if you're hitting any actual trails. A "Traffic Advisory: No Parking for snow clearing" was issued on February 27, 2026, which means crews are out, but that doesn't mean the paths are perfectly clear for pedestrians.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Pollen is low, so at least your sinuses aren't getting double-whammied by allergens and cold air.

<AlertBox type="info">
### General Park Safety
Always be aware of your surroundings, especially when running alone in more secluded areas of parks like Rockwood Park. Let someone know your route and estimated return time. Leave the headphones at home, or at least keep one ear free.
</AlertBox>

Stay safe out there, Saint John. Don't be a hero; be smart.
