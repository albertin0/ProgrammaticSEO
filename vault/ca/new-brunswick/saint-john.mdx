Alright, Saint John, it's a "bundle up and watch your step" kind of day if you absolutely *must* get out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
    *   **Icy Patch Roulette:** Temperatures hovering right around freezing means anything that melted yesterday is a black ice trap this morning. Seriously, don't play hero.
    *   **The Big Dig-Out Continues:** With yesterday's snow and the city still clearing up, expect slush, uneven footing, and surprise snowbanks on sidewalks and less-travelled paths.
    *   **Harbour Bridge Hustle:** That never-ending rehabilitation project on the Saint John Harbour Bridge means intermittent 20-minute closures are still a thing this year, so your riverside run might get interrupted.

## Environmental Breakdown

## Today's Vibe: Winter's Last Gasp, and She's Messy

Let's be real, Saint John. You're waking up to temperatures dancing right around the freezing mark (0.1°C, feels like -4°C), and after the recent "Blizzard of '26" everyone keeps talking about, that means one thing: ice. The city's been battling snow, and yesterday saw parking bans across the South/Central Peninsula for snow removal. What does that translate to for your run? Uneven, slushy sidewalks where plows have gone, and potential for treacherous, icy patches lurking in the shade, especially near the Reversing Falls or along the quieter sections of Rockwood Park. If you're hitting the trails in Rockwood, assume ice. Don't even think about trail running without some serious traction.

<AlertBox type="warning">
    **Ice, Ice, Baby!** Seriously, surfaces will be slick. That 0.1°C feels like a cruel joke because any moisture from yesterday's thaw will have refrozen into a clear, unforgiving sheet. Stick to well-sanded areas if you can, and reconsider that tempo run.
</AlertBox>

On the air quality front, we're sitting at a moderate AQI of 66 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not a lung-buster, but if you're sensitive, you might feel it on a hard effort. Don't go setting any PBs today expecting pristine air.

## Construction Chaos Continues

And then there's the Saint John Harbour Bridge. That rehabilitation project is still chugging along, and for 2026, they've got "20-minute intermittent closures as a result of lifting and lowering the bridge for bearing replacement" on the main bridge itself. If your route takes you across or under it, be prepared for delays or reroutes. Don't plan on smashing any segments if you're stuck waiting for a bridge to do its mechanical dance.

<AlertBox type="danger">
    **Harbour Bridge Hang-Ups:** If your route involves the Saint John Harbour Bridge, anticipate intermittent closures today. You *will* get stopped. Plan an alternate, frustration-free route if you're on a schedule.
</AlertBox>

Lastly, while not an immediate hazard, the city is even talking about permanently closing portions of the Old Lake Trail. Always a good reminder to check local notices before you head out, especially on less-maintained paths.

    **Layer Up, Buttercup:** With temperatures hovering near freezing and feeling colder, multiple thin layers are your friend. Wind can be sneaky around the harbour.
