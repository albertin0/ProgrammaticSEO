Alright, Saint John, it's not a *terrible* day to get out there, but don't expect it to be a walk in the park. Winter's still got its icy grip, and some folks apparently forget how to operate a vehicle once a flake drops.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **The Air's Fine, For Once:** Look, the Air Quality Index is hanging out at a moderate 69 with ozone as the main player, but Environment Canada's actual forecast for today is a nice, low-risk AQHI. So your lungs should be mostly okay to suck in that fresh, crisp harbour air. Low pollen too, if that's usually your jam.
*   **Icy Patches and Slushy Surprises:** We just got walloped with 25 cm of snow earlier this week, and while the major warnings are lifted, the city's still clearing it. Expect residual snow, hidden ice, and slush puddles on sidewalks and lesser-used trails, especially if you're heading through Rockwood Park where snow removal isn't exactly priority one. Watch your step, people.
*   **Roads are a Mixed Bag:** With recent snow clearing operations on streets like Duke St. West and a fresh rant from local radio about "bone-head" drivers, vehicle traffic might still be a bit unpredictable. If you're on two feet or two wheels, assume drivers aren't looking out for you.
</BulletList>

### Don't Be a Hero, Dress Smart

The temperature is hovering around 2.1°C, but it *feels* like -2°C out there. That's prime "layer up but don't overcook it" weather. Think windproof outer shell, decent base layers, and gloves/hat. If you're thinking short sleeves and shorts, you've clearly lost your mind, or you're from somewhere *truly* cold and just trying to show off. Either way, bundle up.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** While the major storm has passed, the lingering snow and freeze-thaw cycles mean sidewalks and unplowed paths are going to be uneven, slippery, and potentially treacherous. This is how you sprain an ankle or worse, especially on any inclines or uneven terrain. Save your joints; consider road-running for better traction if you're not confident on ice.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Harbour Bridge Commute:** The Saint John Harbour Bridge rehabilitation project is still ongoing, with intermittent closures planned through 2026 for bearing replacement. While main lane closures for general traffic aren't as severe as they were in late 2025, if you're trying to cross, be aware there could be 20-minute intermittent stoppages. It's not a smooth sailing experience for pedestrians or cyclists near active work zones. Better to check NB 511 if that's part of your route.

### Pollen Report

Pollen levels are still in the "non-issue" category. Rejoice, allergy sufferers.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Weed        | Low   |

Overall, it's a clear day, which is a rare treat in February sometimes. Just use your head, avoid the sketchy patches, and assume everyone else is driving (or walking) like they've never seen snow before.
