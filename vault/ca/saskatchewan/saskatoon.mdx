Alright, Saskatoon, if you're thinking about lacing up today, know what you're getting into, because it's a bit of a mixed bag out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
-   **Chilly, but clear *for now*:** At 2.1°C with clear skies, it's manageable for a run, but don't expect balmy conditions. Bundle up, seriously.
-   **Ozone's creeping up:** That AQI of 80 with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't terrible for everyone, but if your lungs are sensitive, you might feel it. It's not "ideal" like some might tell you.
-   **Snow's lingering, and more's coming:** The city's been dealing with a "snow event," and while crews are out, some paths and less-trafficked areas might still be slick or covered. Plus, Environment Canada slapped a snow squall watch on us for this evening with winds up to 80 km/h, which means whiteout conditions are a real possibility. If you're out past dusk, you're asking for trouble.
-   **Construction is a perennial joy:** Expect some detours. Junor Avenue southbound from McClocklin Road to 37th Street West has been closed for storm sewer work and that's supposed to wrap up today at 5 PM, so watch for residual mess or lingering equipment. There are also other temporary lane closures on major arteries like New Confederation Drive and 8th Street East today for various maintenance.

### Hazards and What to Do

<AlertBox type="warning">
## Watch Your Step (and Your Head) on the Trails

That 2.1°C is just warm enough for some melt, which means ice underneath. The Meewasin Valley trails, especially the sections near the river, can be notoriously slippery this time of year. Don't assume clear sailing just because the sun's out. Black ice is real, and it doesn't care about your Strava segment.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
## Plan Around the Orange Cones

The City's daily road report is always your friend. Even if you're not driving, significant road closures for pole replacement or tree maintenance, like those on New Confederation Drive or 8th Street East today, mean more traffic on side streets and potential sidewalk closures. It might push more pedestrians onto bike lanes, or vice-versa, creating unexpected obstacles for your run.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
## Evening Wind and Snow Squalls: Just Say No.

Seriously, if Environment Canada is talking 80 km/h gusts and "near zero visibility" due to snow squalls after dark, your run can wait. That's not a challenge; it's a hazard. Get your workout in earlier today, or stick to the treadmill. There's no glory in getting lost in a whiteout or becoming a hood ornament. The windchill alone will suck the joy right out of you, never mind the actual safety risk.
</AlertBox>

The air quality, while not terrible, isn't stellar for a long, hard effort if you're sensitive to ozone. Keep your run moderate, listen to your body, and don't push it. It's February in Saskatoon, not a tropical beach. Save the heroics for a day when Mother Nature isn't actively trying to give you a chest cold or a concussion.
