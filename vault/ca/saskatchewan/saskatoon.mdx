Today's a classic Saskatoon head-scratcher: looks decent at first glance, but Mother Nature's got some real tricks up her sleeve for later. Don't let that clear sky fool you, folks.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is *not* the day (or at least, only for the truly prepared)

<BulletList>
*   **AQI is in the "Moderate" zone at 78, with Ozone being the dominant pollutant.** This isn't fire-season bad, but if you've got lung issues, you might feel it more on those harder efforts.
*   **The temperature is pulling a fast one.** While it's -5.2°C and clear now, the forecast is for a daytime high of 3°C, but then plummeting to a bone-chilling -15°C tonight, with an overnight wind chill hitting -26. That's a rapid swing guaranteed to stress your system if you're out too long.
*   **Icy patches are a near certainty.** With recent mild temperatures and forecasted mixed precipitation tonight, any melt on the Meewasin Valley Trail will turn to ice faster than you can say "Prairie wind."
</BulletList>

Look, I've run more kilometres on the Meewasin than I've had hot meals, and I can tell you, February in Saskatoon is always a gamble. You might start a run feeling fine, only to have the wind whip up and the temperature drop twenty degrees by the time you hit the Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge. Today's exactly that kind of day.

### The Nitty-Gritty for Your Lungs & Joints

| Pollutant Type | Level       | Impact                                     |
| :------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Pollen         | Low         | Minimal concern for most.                  |
| AQI            | 78 Moderate | Elevated for sensitive groups, noticeable for some on hard efforts. |
| Ozone          | Moderate    | Can irritate airways, especially during exertion. |

The "Clear" condition right now is deceptive. Environment Canada is calling for a mix of sun and cloud for the day, and then periods of light snow mixed with rain tonight. That's prime conditions for refreezing, making sections of the Meewasin Valley Trail a real skating rink, particularly in shaded areas or under the bridges. Your knees and ankles will thank you for being cautious.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Extreme Temperature Swings & Wind Chill:** While the daytime might hit a mild 3°C, tonight is forecast to drop to -15°C with a brutal -26 wind chill. Dress in layers you can actually peel off and add back on, or better yet, plan your outdoor activity for earlier in the day and keep it short. Don't get caught out after dark.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Watch for Ice!** With the temperature fluctuating, any moisture on paths will freeze solid, especially as that wind kicks up tonight. Assume all sidewalks, paved paths, and particularly any low-lying or shaded sections of the Meewasin Valley Trail could be slick. Proper footwear with good traction is non-negotiable if you're heading out.

**Layer Up Smart:** Forget your cotton sweats. Think technical fabrics that wick moisture. A good base layer, an insulating mid-layer, and a windproof/water-resistant outer layer are your friends. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and maybe even a neck gaiter for that evening wind.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, folks, respect the Saskatoon winter. It's beautiful, but it doesn't mess around.
