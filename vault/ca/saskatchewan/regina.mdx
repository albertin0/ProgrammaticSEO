Alright, Regina, if you're thinking about that outdoor sweat session today, you might want to adjust your expectations and layer up, because it's a mixed bag out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering around a "moderate" 80 AQI, with nitrogen dioxide being the dominant pollutant. It's not terrible, but if your lungs are sensitive, you might feel it.
*   While the thermometer says -3.5°C, with any wind off Wascana Lake, that wind chill is going to cut right through you, making it feel a good deal colder.
*   Recent snowfall means trails are likely still a mix of packed snow and ice, especially in shaded areas. Watch your footing unless you enjoy an unscheduled meeting with the pavement.
</BulletList>

The sun might be out, giving a false sense of warmth, but don't be fooled. Environment Canada is forecasting partly sunny skies but with overnight lows that are still firmly in winter's grip, and breezy conditions are par for the course this time of year. So, if you're planning a run around Wascana Centre, assume there will be icy patches where the sun hasn't had a chance to do its work.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** With recent snowfall and fluctuating temperatures, many paths, especially those less traveled or shaded, will be slick. Assume ice is present and wear appropriate footwear with good traction. No one wants to spend their afternoon with me, your friendly neighborhood PT, because you decided to wear your summer trainers on a sheet of black ice.

On the construction front, there's no major trail-blocking news specific to today. However, the City of Regina is still pushing ahead with various road projects. For instance, Parliament Avenue saw lane restrictions yesterday, and larger projects like the Park Street upgrades are ongoing from last year. While these might not directly impact your favourite running route in Douglas Park, they affect traffic flow getting there. Always check the city's service notices before you head out, because getting stuck in a traffic snarl just to get to your workout is nobody's idea of fun.

As for the air, while the AQI is moderate, remember that nitrogen dioxide is primarily from vehicle emissions. So, if you're running near heavy traffic, you might be getting a higher dose than you think. Find quieter routes if you're prone to respiratory irritation. Good news on the pollen front, though: it's still negligible, which is one less thing for your sinuses to complain about.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Ragweed     | Low   |
| Mould       | Low   |

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for Success (or at least, survival).** Layers are your friend. A good base layer, something insulating, and a wind-resistant outer shell are essential. Don't forget gloves, a hat, and a neck gaiter. Exposed skin loses heat fast, and frostbite isn't a badge of honour.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**AQI is Moderate for a Reason.** With Nitrogen Dioxide as the main culprit, sensitive populations like those with asthma, lung issues, or heart conditions should seriously consider taking their workout indoors or significantly reducing intensity and duration. "Moderate" doesn't mean "zero risk," especially for prolonged exposure.
