Alright, Regina, if you're thinking about lacing up today, you better really, *really* want it, because it's going to be a brutal one out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

## Why today is decidedly NOT the day for PRs:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Brutal Cold:** It's -17.9°C right now, and while the wind might not be howling like a banshee today, recent forecasts had wind chills plummeting to near -28°C. Your lungs will be burning, and exposed skin will be at risk of frostbite in minutes if you're not bundled up like a mummy.</li>
  <li>**Moderate Air Quality:** With an AQI of 80 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, the air quality isn't doing your lungs any favours. Combine that with the extreme cold, and you're asking for some serious irritation, especially if you're pushing the pace. While real-time ozone levels were reported as healthy earlier this month, your current data points to a moderate concern.</li>
  <li>**Icy & Snowy Trails:** We got hammered with 25 to 35 cm of snow recently, which means even if the main roads are clear, pathways around Wascana Lake are likely still a mix of packed snow and treacherous ice, especially in shaded areas. Watch your footing.</li>
</BulletList>

## Environmental Data Breakdown

| Pollutant          | Level               | Notes                                                              |
| :----------------- | :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pollen             | Low                 | The one silver lining, but let's be real, you won't notice.        |
| Air Quality Index  | 80 (Moderate)       | Dominant pollutant is Ozone. Not ideal for deep breaths. |
| Temperature        | -17.9°C             | Bring layers. All of them.                                         |
| Weather Conditions | Clear               | "Clear" and "-18" are two words that should never go together.     |

## Your Body, Your Choice (But Seriously, Be Smart)

If you absolutely *must* get your miles in, forget setting any records. This isn't the day to push it. Keep your runs short, slow, and stick to well-maintained, cleared routes. That means probably not venturing too far off the main, plowed pathways around, say, the Albert Street Bridge section of Wascana Lake unless you're prepared for deep snow and potential hidden ice traps.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Extreme Cold Alert:** Seriously, we're talking about conditions where frostbite can set in faster than you can say "Regina Winter." Cover every inch of exposed skin. Layers are your best friend. Don't underestimate how quickly things can go sideways out here.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Air Quality & Lung Irritation:** An AQI of 80 with ozone means you'll be sucking in some less-than-stellar air with every frigid breath. If you have any respiratory issues, consider moving your workout indoors. Your lungs will thank you.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Dress for Success (or Survival):** Think synthetic base layers, fleece mid-layers, and a windproof/water-resistant outer shell. Don't forget insulated gloves or mitts, a warm hat that covers your ears, a neck gaiter or balaclava, and well-insulated, waterproof shoes with good traction. Studded shoes aren't a bad idea today for icy patches.
