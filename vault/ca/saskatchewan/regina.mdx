Seriously, Regina, unless your definition of "workout" involves navigating a slip-and-slide or sucking down ozone, maybe keep it indoors today.

<BulletList>
*   Your lungs are going to be working overtime with that moderate AQI, particularly the ozone. It’s not a full-blown smog alert, but it's enough to make you feel it.
*   While the air temperature is playing nice at 3.4°C, don't let that fool you. The past few weeks have dumped enough snow and freezing rain to ensure most shaded or less-trafficked paths are still a treacherous mix of ice and slush. Remember that monster dump on February 17th? Even with crews out, not every surface is clear, and fluctuating temperatures just mean more freeze-thaw cycles making everything slick. Those icy patches on Ring Road and Lewvan Drive we saw a few weeks back are a good reminder that winter doesn't just disappear with a mild day.
*   Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen is taking a well-deserved break. So at least that's one less thing trying to kill you.

## The Rundown: Don't Be a Hero, Be Smart

### Air Quality: It's Not Crisp, It's Ozone

That AQI of 84 means we're firmly in the "Moderate" category, thanks to ozone. For most of you, it's just an annoyance. For us poor souls with sensitive airways, or if you're planning a hard effort, this is where you start to feel that subtle burn in your chest.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Warning:** With an AQI of 84 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, limit prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. If you're susceptible to respiratory issues, consider moving your run or ride inside. It's not worth wheezing for.
</AlertBox>

### Ground Conditions: Regina's Frozen Minefield

Remember that saying about "fake spring"? We're still living it. The current temperature is above freezing, which sounds lovely, but it's the aftermath of earlier heavy snow and freezing rain that'll get you. Don't be surprised when that "clear" path suddenly turns into a skating rink hidden under a thin layer of meltwater, especially as you head towards areas like the trails around **McKell Wascana Conservation Park**. While there are no current *major* construction closures impacting the trails right now, the city's long-term talk of a road extension through there means you might eventually see some disruptions down the line. For today, though, it's all about the ice.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Icy Paths Alert:** Assume all unpaved surfaces and shaded areas are slick. Even with clear skies, melt-freeze cycles make for treacherous footing. Wear appropriate traction, slow down, and maybe pick a well-maintained, salted route if you value your knees and teeth.
</AlertBox>

### General Wisdom: Layers & Vigilance

It might be "clear," but it's still February in Saskatchewan. That 3.4°C can feel colder with any wind, and it'll drop fast once the sun starts dipping. Dress in layers you can shed, and for the love of all that is holy, watch where you're going. A broken ankle from a preventable slip is a real buzzkill for your training plan.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro-Tip:** If you're heading out for a run or walk on any of Regina's paths, especially around Wascana Lake, stick to the main paved sections where city crews have had a chance to work their magic. Even then, proceed with caution.
