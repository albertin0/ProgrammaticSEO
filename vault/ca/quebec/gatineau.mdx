Don't let the currently clear skies and mild temperatures trick you, Gatineau – today is a subtle trap for the unprepared runner.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   AQI at 75, driven by fine particulate matter, means your lungs are working harder than they should, so maybe keep the intensity dialed back.
*   While it's currently near freezing (-0.1°C), Gatineau Park trails are still reported as hard and icy from previous warm spells, meaning a slip-and-slide adventure if you're not careful.
*   Environment Canada is calling for wicked wind chills plummeting to -11°C in the evening and a brutal -26°C overnight, so any late-day outdoor workout will be punishing on exposed skin.
*   Pollen is low, which is about the only good news for your airways today.

Look, the sun might be out right now, and the thermometer says we're hovering right around that magical zero-degree mark. Perfect, right? Wrong. This is Quebec in late February; Mother Nature's always got a trick up her sleeve, and today she's setting a few traps.

First off, let's talk about the air. Your lung fuel is sitting at an AQI of 75, which is firmly in the "moderate" zone. The dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter. That means tiny crap floating around that your lungs would rather not deal with. It's not "stay indoors and board up the windows" bad, but it's definitely "don't try to PR your 5k today" bad. If you've got asthma or any other respiratory quirks, consider this your official warning to take it easy.

Then there are the trails. The National Capital Commission (NCC) just a few days ago noted that the trail surfaces in Gatineau Park were "hard and icy" after some spring-like conditions. Sure, they're planning to rework some surfaces after tonight's expected precipitation, but you know what that means: some spots are still going to be a death trap. You step on a seemingly innocent patch of snow, and BAM, you're on your butt, wondering how your knee bent that way.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Icy Trails Ahead!** The NCC specifically recommends crampons for winter hiking trails in Gatineau Park due to current icy conditions. Do yourself a favor and listen to them. Your orthopedist will thank you.
</AlertBox>

And let's not forget the grand finale: tonight's weather. While it's clear now, Environment Canada is forecasting periods of light snow starting early this evening, with winds picking up. The real kicker is the wind chill: it's going to hit -11°C in the evening and then plummet to a soul-crushing -26°C overnight. So that casual run you're planning after work? Be prepared for it to feel like you're running through a meat locker. Frostbite is a real thing, people, and it happens faster than you think when those wind chill values drop this low.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Wind Chill Incoming!** If you're planning an evening workout, reconsider. Wind chills will plunge to dangerous levels tonight. Cover all exposed skin and monitor forecasts closely if you absolutely *must* be out there.
</AlertBox>

Finally, keep an eye out for municipal operations. The city of Gatineau is often busy with snow removal after even a light snowfall, and you don't want to be in the way of a plow, especially with an overnight parking ban in effect from 3 AM to 6 AM for snow clearing.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Heads Up, Commuters:** Check the City of Gatineau's "Work, major projects, road closures and pathway closures" page. While no major new road closures were announced today for general exercise, ongoing work, like potential detours on Promenade du Portage, could impact your route.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're going out, stick to known, cleared routes if possible, dress for the *feels like* temperature, not just the thermometer, and maybe save the heroics for a day when the air isn't trying to scrape your lungs and the ground isn't trying to break your bones.
