Today is a decent day to get outside if you’re smart about it, but don't expect any personal bests unless you're chasing frostbite.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   It's clear out, which is nice, but the temperature is hovering around -6.3°C. Bundle up, or your lungs will feel like you've been breathing sandpaper.
*   AQI is a moderate 69 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not great, not terrible, but if you're sensitive, keep your run shorter than usual.
*   Expect snow accumulation and compaction on trails, especially in Gatineau Park. Roads in the broader Outaouais region are still partly snow-covered. This means slippery sections are a guarantee, so watch your footing.

## The Cold, Hard Truth About Running in Gatineau Today

Alright, folks, let's talk about hitting the pavement or trails in Gatineau today, February 26, 2026. The good news? No apocalyptic weather warnings from Environment Canada for our city, which is always a win in winter. You won't be battling freezing rain, which was a concern a little while back, so that's a relief. The skies are clear, which sounds inviting, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's balmy. We're sitting at a crisp -6.3°C. The "feels like" factor with any wind means you need layers, good gloves, and proper headgear, or you'll be asking for trouble.

Your lungs will thank you for taking it easy on the pace, especially with that moderate AQI of 69 driven by ozone. It's not dire, but it's enough to notice if you're pushing too hard. Keep an eye on any shortness of breath or irritation. This isn't the day to try and set a new 5K record around Lac des Fées.

### Mind Your Step: Icy Patches are Inevitable
Even with clear skies, those trails and side streets aren't going to be magically bare. Gatineau Park reports snow accumulation and compaction, which translates to uneven, potentially icy, and slippery surfaces. We're still firmly in winter conditions here, so assume every shadow hides a slick patch of black ice. Traction is key – consider spikes for your shoes if you're hitting anything off the main, well-plowed routes. A twisted ankle on an icy patch can ruin your whole week, trust me.

## Construction Continues: Where the Parkway Gets Tricky

For those of you who use the Gatineau Parkway as your go-to route, be aware that the ongoing rehabilitation project between Alexandre-Taché Boulevard and the former Gamelin Street is still happening. This work started back in June 2025 and involves everything from culvert replacement to guardrail repair. While it's crucial infrastructure work, it means potential detours, uneven surfaces, and possibly reduced pathway access in sections. Always stay alert in these areas; construction sites are no joke for pedestrian safety, especially when you're distracted by the cold or trying to maintain your stride.

### Post-Workout Recovery: Warm Up Quickly!
After you've had your fill of the chilly air, get inside and warm up slowly. Hot showers are great, but don't shock your system. Hydrate with something warm. Pay attention to any joint aches that feel different than normal post-run soreness – cold weather can exacerbate minor issues.

In short, today requires a bit of planning and a lot of common sense. Enjoy the clear skies, but respect the cold, the air quality, and the slick surfaces. There's no major event blocking your way, but Mother Nature and the City of Gatineau are still throwing a few curveballs.
