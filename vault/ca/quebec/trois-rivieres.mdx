It's cold enough out there to make your teeth chatter just thinking about it, but if you're bundled right, a run in Trois-Rivières is actually quite doable today.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That -6.8°C might look mild on the thermometer, but with a potential for wind up to 39 km/h, it'll feel like a kick to the face. Your joints will thank you for taking it easy.
*   The air quality is 'moderate' due to fine particulate matter. Nothing to panic about, but combine that with freezing air and your lungs will certainly notice the extra effort.
*   Good news: no major road closures or event-related trail blocks reported that should derail your route. One minor construction hindrance on Chemin du Lac-Édouard apparently wraps up today, so that's something.

## The Rundown: Don't Be a Hero, Dress Like a Local

Let's be brutally honest, running in Trois-Rivières in late February means you're not exactly hitting your PBs unless you're built for arctic conditions. Today is no different. While the sky might be clear, that -6.8°C (which often *feels* colder, let's be real) isn't messing around.

### Your Lungs: Filtering More Than Just Bad Thoughts

With an AQI of 64 and fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, your lungs are already working overtime to filter out the gunk. Add freezing air to that cocktail, and you've got a recipe for a burning throat and restricted airways if you push too hard without proper warm-up. If you're prone to exercise-induced bronchospasm or have asthma, consider today an indoor day or significantly dial back your intensity. Don't be that person hacking up a lung on the Promenade des Forges.

### Your Joints: Brittle as Old Croûtons

Cold weather always means your joints need extra love. Your synovial fluid thickens, making everything feel stiffer. Skimp on the warm-up, and you're asking for trouble, especially if you plan on hitting any uneven terrain, say, near the Forges du Saint-Maurice National Historic Site. While there are no specific ice warnings, assume there could be black ice lurking in shaded spots, especially this time of year when melt-freeze cycles are common. Every PT knows that cold, stiff muscles are prime candidates for strains and pulls.

### Don't Skimp on the Layers
Layering is key, but don't overdo it. You want to be slightly chilly when you start, not sweating through your base layer five minutes in. Think wicking fabrics, a wind-resistant outer shell, and definitely protect those extremities. A good pair of gloves or mittens and a hat are non-negotiable. Frostbite is a real thing, even on "clear" days.

### Hydration Isn't Just for Summer
Just because it's cold doesn't mean you can skip the water. Cold air can be surprisingly dry, and you're still losing fluids through sweat and respiration. Drink up before and after your run. Your body will thank you.
</AlertBox>

## Final Verdict

It's a typical late-winter Trois-Rivières day. The cold is the main antagonist for your joints, and the air quality isn't doing your lungs any favors, but it's not a complete no-go. Just manage your expectations, dress smart, and for the love of all that is holy, warm up properly. Your PT (me) is watching.
