Alright, Trois-Rivières, let's cut to the chase: Today's a day for the dedicated, but you better be smart about it, or you'll regret that outdoor push.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
  *   It's clear out there, which is a win, but don't let the sunshine fool you; it's still cold enough to make your teeth ache.
  *   Pollen count is finally playing nice, staying low, so your sinuses can breathe easy if the cold doesn't clamp them shut first.
  *   Air quality is sitting on the fence, with moderate ozone levels. If your lungs are already finicky, think twice before pushing hard.
</BulletList>

### Weather Report: Cold, Clear, and Crispy

Currently, it's a brisk -4.7°C, but that wind chill is making it feel more like -11°C. While the skies are clear, perfect for actually *seeing* where you're going, the real bite will hit you when the sun dips. Temperatures are expected to plummet tonight, with lows around -14°C to -18°C. If you're planning an evening or late afternoon run, layer up like you're heading to the North Pole, not just down the street to the trails along the Saint-Maurice River.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  The combination of freezing temperatures and wind chill can lead to frostnip or frostbite if you're not properly covered. Exposed skin, especially ears, nose, and fingers, is vulnerable.

### Air Quality & Allergens: A Mixed Bag

Your nose can relax a bit today; pollen levels are low. However, our air quality is hovering in the moderate zone with an AQI of 73, and ozone is the dominant pollutant. For most, this isn't a showstopper, but if you have asthma, COPD, or other respiratory sensitivities, that ozone could irritate your airways. Don't be a hero; listen to your body.

| Pollen Type | Level (Trois-Rivières) |
| :---------- | :--------------------- |
| All Pollen  | Low                    |

<AlertBox type="info">
  On days with moderate AQI, especially with ozone, consider moving your high-intensity workout indoors or reducing your duration and effort outside. This is particularly true if you notice any unusual coughing, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort.

### Local Road & Trail Conditions: Mind Your Step

While there aren't any massive closures screwing up your routes, Quebec511 did flag some minor hindrances today on Rue du Parc, near Boulevard Thibeau, and at the intersection of Rue du Parc, specifically between 1 PM and 3 PM. If your route takes you through these areas, be aware of potential detours or slower spots. Beyond that, expect a mix of "Bare and Wet" or "Partly Snow Covered" roadways and trails. That means black ice is always a sneaky bastard, especially in shaded areas or as the day cools. Those trails along the Saint-Maurice could be slick in spots, so proper footwear is non-negotiable.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  Patchy ice, especially on shaded paths and bridges (like those crossing over or near the Saint-Maurice River), is a serious fall risk. Assume all wet-looking surfaces could be ice. Spikes or proper winter traction on your footwear are highly recommended.
