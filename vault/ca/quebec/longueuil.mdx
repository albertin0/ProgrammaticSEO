Look, if you like frozen snot and crunchy eyeballs, then yeah, today's a *great* day for an outdoor workout.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
  <li>**Brutal Cold:** It's -3.8°C out there, clear skies, but don't let that sun fool you. Regional forecasts for Montreal, just across the river, are talking about temps dropping as low as -18°C with wind chills making it feel even worse. Your lungs will feel it, your joints will protest. Layer up, seriously.</li>
  <li>**"Moderate" Air Quality is Still a Factor:** We're sitting at an AQI of 60, with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. Now, I've run in worse, but for anyone with sensitive lungs, especially with that deep cold, this isn't ideal. It's not wildfire smoke *today* directly affecting us, but that fine dust still gets in there.</li>
  <li>**Low Pollen is a Win:** For those of us who spend half the year looking like we've been crying at a sad movie, the "Low" pollen count is about the only good news your sinuses are getting today.</li>
</BulletList>

### Longueuil, Wrap Up Warm and Watch Your Step

The good news? No major floods wiping out our favourite routes along the St. Lawrence River, and the recent "accidental" fire near Churchill Boulevard and Taschereau Boulevard seems to have cleared up, with traffic reopened. So at least you won't be navigating around active blaze zones.

However, the cold is no joke. That -3.8°C feels a lot colder when you're moving. And while Longueuil is always doing its "info-travaux" to improve parks and bike paths, there haven't been any *new* major trail closures reported in the last 24 hours specific to major running spots like Parc de la Cité. So, your usual loops are probably clear of unexpected detours, but definitely icy.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Weed        | Low   |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Icy Patches and Frostbite Risk:** With the cold temps, any melting from yesterday or morning dew will be black ice. Treat every shaded patch on your run, especially on trails in Parc de la Cité or those smaller paths near the waterfront, as a potential slip-and-fall waiting to happen. Exposed skin is going to get hit by the cold fast. Cover your ears, nose, and fingers.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Hydrate, Even When It's Cold:** You might not feel as thirsty, but the dry, cold air still dehydrates you. Keep sipping water or an electrolyte drink, even if it's lukewarm. And for the love of all that is holy, stretch *indoors* before you head out. Cold muscles are cranky muscles.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Fine Particulate Matter + Cold = Lung Irritation:** While an AQI of 60 isn't terrible, the dominant pollutant being fine particulate matter, combined with the freezing temperatures, can be harsh on your respiratory system. If you start wheezing or feeling a burn in your chest, cut your workout short. Your lungs will thank you later.
