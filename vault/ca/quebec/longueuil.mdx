Today isn't the absolute worst, but if you're hitting the Longueuil streets or trails, you better layer up and keep your eyes peeled for more than just black ice.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   It's a frosty -5.7°C out there, feeling more like a bitter -13°C with the wind chill. Bundle up, seriously.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate AQI of 73, with Ozone being the main culprit. Not great for pushing the pace, especially if your lungs are sensitive.
*   Major road closures due to a fire this morning and ongoing construction mean your usual routes might be blocked.

## The Rundown

Alright, Longueuil, let's talk about getting outside today. The sky's clear, which is nice for February, but that's about where the "nice" stops if you're planning an intense outdoor sweat session.

### Air Quality & Allergens

The pollen count is happily low, so your nose won't be running from allergies, just from the cold.

| Pollen Level |
| :----------- |
| Low          |

However, the air quality isn't exactly pristine. We're looking at a moderate AQI of 73, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Warning: Ozone in the Air**
With a moderate AQI of 73 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, those with respiratory issues or heart conditions should seriously consider limiting intense outdoor activity. Smog, often exacerbated by wood heating in winter, can be particularly nasty. Don't push it if you're sensitive.
</AlertBox>

### Weather Woes: It's Cold, Folks

The temperature itself is -5.7°C, which isn't unheard of for late February in Quebec. But the "feels like" temperature is a solid -13°C. That's the kind of cold that bites, not just nips.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Extreme Cold Alert: Dress for Success (or Survival)**
With a "feels like" temperature of -13°C, exposed skin can get cold fast. Layer up. Think thermal base layers, a good insulating mid-layer, and a windproof/water-resistant outer shell. Don't forget a hat, gloves or mittens, and a neck gaiter. Frostbite is no joke.
</AlertBox>

### Local Hazards: Don't Get Burned or Stuck

This is where things get a bit more spicy than usual.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Road Closures & Smoke Hazard: Major Fire on Fernand-Lafontaine Boulevard**
There was a *major* building fire in an industrial area early this morning. This has caused **Fernand-Lafontaine Boulevard to be completely closed between Jacques-Cartier Boulevard East and du Lac Road.** On top of that, traffic lights are out on Jacques-Cartier Boulevard East between Fernand-Lafontaine Boulevard and Highway 20. Police are telling everyone to avoid the area. If your route goes anywhere near there, find an alternative. And honestly, a "major building fire" implies there might still be some lingering smoke or air quality issues *very* localized to that zone, even beyond the general AQI reading. Stay clear.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Alert: Rue de la Savane Closed**
If you typically run or bike near Rue de la Savane, be aware that it's completely closed between Leckie and Bishop due to emergency pumping station repairs. This closure has been in effect since February 24th and is for an indefinite period. You'll need to reroute.
</AlertBox>

### Trail Talk: Winter Cycling and Icy Patches

Longueuil actually makes an effort to clear some of its bike paths in winter, with 60 km plowed this season, and a goal of 116.5 km by 2025. That's progress. But even cleared paths can be treacherous.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Winter Path Wisdom: Watch for Ice**
While sections of Longueuil's cycling network, like parts of the path between Longueuil and Carignan, are cleared, assume there could be icy patches, especially in shaded areas or after freeze-thaw cycles. If you're on two wheels, consider studded tires. If you're on foot, proper winter traction on your shoes is a must. The Jacques-Cartier Bridge bike path, for instance, is notorious for difficult winter conditions and black ice, often closing entirely.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're heading out, be smart, stay warm, and for heaven's sake, avoid the fire zone and detours.
