Alright Levis, listen up. If you're planning on hitting the trails today, you better bundle up and watch your step, because Mother Nature is playing a cruel joke with the temperature, and the ground might be a lot slicker than it looks.

<BulletList>
*   **Black Ice is Back:** We're looking at a freeze-thaw cycle, which means even if it's "clear," those paths and sidewalks, especially around shaded areas or underpasses near the Sentiers La Balade, are likely coated in a treacherous layer of black ice. One minute you're crushing it, the next you're on your butt. Don't be that guy.
*   **Chilly to the Bone:** While it might look sunny, the actual temperature is -7.7°C, but with the wind chill, it's felt closer to -21°C earlier this morning. That's not just "brisk," that's "expose skin for too long and you're in trouble" cold.
*   **Moderate Lung Burn:** Our air quality index is sitting at 59, which is officially "moderate," with fine particulate matter being the main culprit. If you've got sensitive lungs, or you're pushing serious intensity, you might notice it. It's not a full-blown smog alert, but it's not pristine mountain air either.

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### Beware the Invisible Threat: Black Ice!
Seriously, I can't stress this enough. With temperatures hovering around freezing and recent precipitation (even just a dusting of snow turning to light rain), you're walking into a minefield of black ice. Assume every shady patch or seemingly damp spot on trails, roads, and especially bridges like the one crossing the Chaudière River, is a slip-and-slide waiting to happen. Consider microspikes or stay on well-gritted, busy routes. Your ankles will thank you.

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Dress for the Real Cold, Not Just the Thermometer
Don't let the "clear" skies fool you. That -7.7°C combined with any breeze feels significantly colder, easily hitting that "quite cold" to "bitterly cold" range where exposed skin can get frostbite fast. Layers are your friend, windproof outer shells are essential, and don't forget the hat, gloves, and a neck gaiter. If you're out on the open paths along the St. Lawrence, that wind will cut right through you.

#### Trail Traffic & Air Quality Check
Today, there's a FatBike Joring event at Sentiers Vélo Lévis starting this morning, so expect some increased activity on those trails. If you prefer solitude, pick another spot or time. As for the moderate AQI, most healthy individuals should be fine for outdoor exercise. However, if you have asthma or other respiratory conditions, pay attention to your body. Maybe dial back the intensity slightly or opt for a shorter session.

Look, the city isn't under a weather emergency, and the skies are clear, which is usually a runner's dream in February. But "clear" in winter Levis often means "hidden dangers." Prioritize staying upright and warm over setting any personal bests.
