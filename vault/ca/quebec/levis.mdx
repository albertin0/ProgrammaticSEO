If you're looking for a comfortable outdoor run in Lévis today, you're going to need to embrace the cold, because while it's clear, it's brutally cold, and the wind chill is no joke.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Bitterly Cold Temps & Wind Chill:** Temperatures are firmly in the negative, with wind chills plummeting well below -10°C, making exposed skin highly vulnerable to frostbite.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** While not terrible, the AQI is in the moderate range due to ozone, which can be an irritant if you're pushing hard.
*   **Slippery Surfaces:** It's winter in Quebec. Assume ice is hiding under that pristine snow, especially on less-trafficked routes.
</BulletList>

## Lévis Weather: Dress for the Arctic, Not a Spring Jaunt

Alright, Lévis, let's talk about "Clear" skies. Sounds lovely, right? Like a crisp winter wonderland. Don't be fooled. That clear sky means you're getting the full force of a -6.1°C day, dropping to a bone-chilling -18°C overnight. But the real kicker? The wind chill. We're talking about it feeling like -14°C this evening, and by tonight, it'll be a delightful -23°C. Seriously, my teeth ache just thinking about it.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Cold Warning!** With wind chills feeling like -23°C overnight, exposed skin is at risk of frostbite in as little as 15 minutes. Bundle up, cover *everything*, and listen to your body.
</AlertBox>

If you insist on hitting the trails, like those out near the Centre de plein air de Lévis, be prepared for icy patches, especially on shaded sections or where snowmelt has refrozen. It's not a matter of *if* you'll find ice, but *when*.

## Air Quality: More Annoyance Than Alarm

The air quality is sitting at an AQI of 77, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's "Moderate," which, let's be honest, means it's not ideal, but it's not going to make you sprout a third lung either. For your average easy jog, you'll probably barely notice. If you're planning an interval session or anything that really gets your lungs burning, you might feel a bit more irritation than usual.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality (Ozone):** AQI 77 means the air is okay for most, but those with respiratory sensitivities might experience some irritation, especially during high-intensity exercise. Don't go setting any personal bests today.

### Pollen Breakdown (Because someone always asks)

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for the sniffle brigade: pollen is low. So at least you won't be battling seasonal allergies on top of everything else.

## Local Alerts & Hazards: Just the Usual Winter Grind

In terms of specific, recent workout-disrupting news for Lévis, things are pretty quiet on the wildfire smoke, high winds, or major flooding front. Environment Canada hasn't issued any severe weather alerts for the Lévis area in the last 24 hours.

We did have a boil water advisory in the Charny Sonate sector from an aqueduct break, which is expected to lift on Friday. Not directly a trail hazard, but it's a reminder that Lévis infrastructure is always up to *something*. Otherwise, it's just standard Quebec winter rules: watch your footing, stay visible, and don't forget your extra layers.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip for Winter Running:** Layers are your friend. Windproof outer shells are non-negotiable. Don't forget insulated gloves, a hat that covers your ears, and a neck gaiter you can pull over your face when that wind decides to really bite. And for the love of all things holy, check your cleats for traction before heading out.

Stay safe out there, Lévis. And maybe consider the treadmill today, just this once.
