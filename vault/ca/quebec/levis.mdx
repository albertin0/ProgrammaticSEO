If you're looking for a comfortable run outside in Lévis today, you're dreaming. It's a bone-chilling February day, so unless you actually enjoy feeling like your face might shatter, maybe stick to the treadmill.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   It's absolutely freezing out there. The official temperature might be -4.7°C, but don't let that "clear" sky fool you. Wind gusts, particularly those predicted to make it feel like -12°C to -15°C over in Quebec City (and Lévis isn't exactly sheltered), will have your lungs burning and joints stiffening in no time. Dress like you're planning a trip to the North Pole, not a jog along the St. Lawrence.
*   Air quality is sitting at a "moderate" 74 AQI due to ozone. If you've got even a hint of sensitivity in your lungs, adding that to the biting cold is a recipe for a wheezy, miserable experience. Pollen is low, which is nice, but who cares when your face is numb?
*   Hazard-wise, while there aren't any specific "don't go outside or you'll die" warnings from Environment Canada for Lévis today, let's be real. It's winter in Quebec. Assume every shaded corner and untraversed path is a black ice trap waiting for an unsuspecting ankle.

### Local Hazards & Tips

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### Stay Clear of Quai Paquet's Closed Section!
Don't be that person who tries to sneak past the barriers. A portion of Quai Paquet, a popular spot near the Lévis ferry terminal, has been *closed indefinitely* since January 15th due to "localized erosion and structural deformation." Seriously, the city isn't closing it for fun. While the rest of the Parcours des Anses remains accessible, respect the barriers around the Quai Paquet section. Your run isn't worth a trip to the emergency room, or worse, a plunge into the icy Saint-Laurent.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Mind the Wind Chill and Icy Patches
The "clear" skies are a trap, mostly. That crisp air is going to feel significantly colder thanks to the wind, especially near the river. Layer up, cover exposed skin, and for the love of all that is holy, wear proper traction. I'm talking microspikes if you're hitting anything remotely trail-like, or at least shoes with serious grip if you're sticking to paved routes like the Parcours des Anses. Even asphalt can be treacherously slick.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
#### Hydrate, Even When It's Cold
Just because you're not sweating buckets doesn't mean you don't need water. Your body still loses fluids in cold, dry air. And no, a double-double from Tim Hortons before your run doesn't count as hydration. Drink water, people.
