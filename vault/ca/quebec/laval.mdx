It's February 28th, Laval, and if you were hoping for a pristine run today, temper your expectations.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky is packing a sneaky punch with moderate air quality, especially if your lungs are already finicky.
*   It's cold enough to make your joints creak if you don't warm up properly, and don't assume every surface is dry. Ice is a real jerk this time of year.
*   Pollen is low, so at least your nose won't be staging a rebellion, but the fine particulate matter in the air is enough to make you think twice.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. You've got miles to log, and the Parc de la Rivière-des-Mille-Îles is calling your name. But before you lace up and head out the door, let's have a little chat about reality today.

The weather app might say "Clear," but that crisp air comes with a downside. Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 78, and the dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter. For those of us who actually *breathe* while working out, that's not ideal. While it's generally okay for most, if you're in a sensitive group – think asthma, bronchitis, or just generally not loving lung irritation – today's air quality edges into what Quebec's own monitoring system would classify as "poor" for vulnerable individuals. So, maybe don't push for that new personal best if you usually feel it in your chest on hazy days.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### AQI: Moderate (but watch out, sensitive lungs)
Your lungs are going to be working overtime today, and with fine particulate matter as the star pollutant, anyone with respiratory issues should proceed with caution. AccuWeather calls it "Fair," meaning sensitive groups *could* experience minor to moderate symptoms. Listen to your body, not just your playlist.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the cold. We're hovering around -3.6°C, which isn't exactly tropical. [provided] While there aren't any extreme cold warnings for Laval right now, Quebec511 did warn about potential slippery roads in some regions of Quebec for today, Saturday, due to snow accumulation and strong winds. Even if our streets look clear, black ice can be a real ankle-breaker. The trails, especially those shaded spots along the riverbanks or in wooded areas near places like the Parc des Prairies, could still be treacherous. A slip on ice at speed is a surefire way to earn yourself a new physical therapy client (me, by the way, if you need one).

<AlertBox type="info">
### Dress for Success (and survival)
Layer up, people. Hat, gloves, moisture-wicking base layers. Don't cheap out on the gear. And for the love of your knees, consider some traction cleats if you're hitting anything that looks remotely icy. Your physiotherapist (again, me) thanks you in advance.
</AlertBox>

Finally, for those who cycle or commute, remember that construction is a constant companion in Laval. While no specific trail closures in Laval were reported in the last 24 hours, the ongoing reconstruction of the Île-aux-Tourtes bridge means traffic flow changes and disruptions are always a possibility on the major arteries, even if the multi-use path isn't slated until 2028. Keep your head on a swivel.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch Your Step (and wheels)
Even without active snowfall, the fluctuating temperatures mean icy patches are a distinct possibility, especially in shaded areas or on less-travelled paths. If you're near any ongoing construction, like the constant work around the Île-aux-Tourtes bridge, be extra vigilant for uneven surfaces or unexpected detours.
</AlertBox>

So, go ahead and get your workout in, but don't be a hero. This isn't the day to push through discomfort, especially when it comes to your lungs or avoiding a preventable face-plant on the ice. Stay safe out there.
