If you're thinking about hitting the trails in Laval today, February 26, 2026, you're going to need more than just good intentions – you'll need layers and a thick skin, literally.

<BulletList>
*   **Deep Freeze with an Attitude:** While the sun might make a guest appearance, the -6.1°C air temperature combined with a brisk wind will make it feel like a brutal -13°C to -18°C out there. Your joints will thank you for staying inside.
*   **Ozone is Hanging Around:** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 72 today, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. It’s not terrible, but it's certainly not doing your lungs any favours if you're pushing hard.
*   **Visibility Drop Incoming:** Environment Canada issued a special weather statement forecasting heavy flurries for *this evening*, potentially dropping visibility to near zero. Plan your outdoor time carefully, unless you enjoy running blind.

### Weather Woes: It's Colder Than It Looks

Don't let that "clear" sky fool you. Laval is in the grip of some serious winter chill. That -6.1°C might not sound too bad from inside your cozy kitchen, but factor in the west winds blowing at 20 km/h, gusting up to 37 km/h, and you're looking at a wind chill that will make your face ache and your fingers go numb if you're not properly prepared. We're talking real bone-chilling cold that sticks with you. And if you're planning an evening workout, expect temperatures to plummet further, with overnight lows around -13°C, feeling even colder with the wind. This isn't just discomfort; it's prime frostbite territory if you're not careful.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Extreme Cold and Wind Chill Advisory:** Temperatures feel significantly colder than they appear. Exposed skin is at risk. Keep your runs short and layered, especially if you're heading anywhere exposed like along the shores of Parc de la Rivière-des-Mille-Îles where that wind off the water can be relentless.

### Air Quality & Allergens: One Less Thing to Worry About

Good news on the allergen front: pollen levels are mercifully low. So, no sneezing fits mid-stride today. However, our AQI is in the moderate zone (72) thanks to ozone. While not a red-alert situation, anyone with respiratory sensitivities should still exercise a bit of caution. It's not a reason to cancel, but it's a reason to monitor how you're feeling, especially if you're really pushing your pace.

### Road and Trail Conditions: Watch for the White Stuff

While there haven't been specific *new* trail closures reported in the last 24 hours for Laval's extensive network, the forecast for heavy flurries this evening is a concern. This means that by later today, surfaces could become slippery, and visibility could drop significantly. If you're out running on city sidewalks, remember that ongoing roadworks, like those on Saint-Martin between De la Mauricie and Chomedey, might mean uneven surfaces or temporary detours, so keep an eye out even if you're just on a quick urban loop.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Buttercup:** Think three to four layers. A moisture-wicking base, an insulating mid-layer, and a windproof, water-resistant outer shell are non-negotiable. Don't forget insulated gloves, a hat that covers your ears, and a neck gaiter or balaclava to protect your face from that wicked wind chill.

This isn't the day for setting personal bests in shorts and a tank top. Be smart, stay warm, and don't push your luck. There's always tomorrow.
