Alright, Laval, it’s cold out there, but that’s hardly news for late February. Today's not the *worst* day to get your miles in, but it's definitely not a day for ignoring the basics.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Brutal Cold:** The mercury is stubbornly hanging around -5.1°C today, but it’s going to plummet overnight. Factor in the wind, and exposed skin could be asking for trouble in under a minute if you're not properly bundled. We’re talking frostbite territory if you mess around.
*   **Moderate Air, But Don't Push It:** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a "moderate" 73, with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. Most of us will be fine, but if you've got sensitive lungs, maybe skip that high-intensity interval session by the traffic this afternoon.
*   **Sneaky Ice & Snow:** While the major roadways are reported as "Bare and Dry", don't mistake that for clear trails. We had some flurries yesterday, and more a tiny bit today. With temperatures well below freezing, any melt-and-refreeze cycles mean black ice is a very real possibility, especially in shaded areas or on less-maintained paths.
*   **Winter Festival Fun:** Centre de la Nature is currently host to Laval en Blanc, so expect it to be a hub of activity. If you're planning a quiet run around the park, be aware of increased foot traffic and designated areas for winter sports. That also means certain paths might be groomed for specific activities like cross-country skiing, not necessarily your trail run.

</BulletList>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Cold Warning (Unofficial):** Seriously, folks. Even with a "clear" sky, the actual temperature coupled with wind chill makes proper layering non-negotiable. Think wool, not cotton, and cover *everything*. Frostbite is no joke and comes on faster than you think.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Good news on the pollen front – it's practically non-existent right now, so no sneezing fits interrupting your cadence.

### Construction Woes

There's always some form of construction happening in Laval, isn't there? We've got ongoing residential projects like Habitation Palerme in Vimont, and infrastructure extensions like on Rue des Balades. While these aren't directly blocking the main running arteries, be mindful of potential detours, construction vehicle traffic, and any lingering dust, especially if you're running near these areas. Don't assume your usual route is clear without checking.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step on Trails:** Given the sub-zero temperatures and recent light snowfall, assume that any untreated bike paths or walking trails, particularly those along the Rivière des Mille Îles where shade persists, could be slick with ice. Traction aids on your shoes might save you a nasty fall.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress Smart, Stay Safe:** Hydration is still key, even in the cold. And for the love of all that is holy, wear reflective gear if you’re out before the sun's fully up or after it dips. Visibility is always a concern, especially with winter light.
