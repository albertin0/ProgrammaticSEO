Listen up, Sherbrooke. Today’s one of those days where you really have to *want* it to get outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality isn't doing your lungs any favors, clocking in at a "moderate" 76 AQI due to ozone. Your body works harder to filter that junk.
*   It's cold out there at -3.7°C and while it's clear right now, winter in the Eastern Townships always means hidden ice patches, especially on trails where the sun doesn't hit. Don't go face-planting because you thought your old running shoes had enough grip.
*   If your route involves downtown, prepare for detours. Wellington South is shut down, and it's not a short-term thing.
</BulletList>

## The Full Breakdown

Your lungs are going to feel that moderate AQI today. It's not enough to warrant an emergency, but anyone with asthma or other respiratory issues should probably opt for the treadmill. For the rest of us, it means our bodies are working overtime to clean up the air while we’re trying to breathe deeply. Don't ignore it.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate AQI for Ozone
With an AQI of 76 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, sensitive individuals (asthmatics, elderly, children) should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. Even for healthy runners, this isn't prime breathing air. Consider a shorter, less intense workout or move it indoors.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the cold. While -3.7°C sounds "mild" for a Quebec winter, it's still cold enough to cause issues. The City of Sherbrooke's own advice for winter trails tells you to check conditions and *gear up properly with cleats*. Why? Because even on a clear day, those shaded spots on trails like those around the Base de plein air André-Nadeau can be slick with ice. A fractured ankle or torn meniscus from a preventable fall is not how you want to spend your afternoon.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Beware of Ice and Cold Exposure
Despite the "clear" conditions, temperatures below freezing mean ice is a constant threat, especially on less-trafficked paths or shaded areas. Bundle up, cover exposed skin, and seriously consider those ice cleats, particularly if you're hitting any groomed trails that haven't been cleared.
</AlertBox>

And finally, the joy of urban running: construction. From 7 a.m. today, February 26th, until April 10th, a section of Wellington South is completely closed due to private construction. If your usual downtown loop takes you anywhere near Sanborn Street, you're going to need a new plan. This isn't just a minor inconvenience; it's a significant blockage that could force you into busier streets or onto uneven sidewalks. Plan your route, or better yet, avoid that specific area entirely for the next few weeks.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Wellington South Closure!
Heads up, downtown runners! Wellington South is COMPLETELY CLOSED starting today, February 26th, at the corner of Sanborn Street. This closure is expected to last until April 10th. Plan your routes accordingly to avoid this major disruption.
