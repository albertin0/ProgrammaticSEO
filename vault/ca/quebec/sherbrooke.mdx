Alright, Sherbrooke, if you're thinking of hitting the pavement today, you might want to reconsider that long run or brace yourself.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is *mostly* not the day:

<BulletList>
*   **That Persistent Sherbrooke Chill:** Seriously, it's -5.3°C out there, and with the wind, it feels colder than a politician's promise. Your joints are going to feel every single kilometer, especially if you haven't warmed up properly. Don't be a hero; nobody wants to deal with cold-induced muscle pulls.
*   **Air Quality: Moderate, with a Side of Ozone:** The AQI is sitting at 73, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not "stay indoors and panic" bad, but it's not exactly crisp mountain air either. If you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel this one.
*   **Wellington South is a Construction Zone:** Good luck navigating your usual downtown route. A major section of Wellington South, right around Sanborn Street, is completely shut down for private construction until April 10th. Pedestrian access is "maintained," which usually means "prepare for detours, uneven surfaces, and dodging construction equipment." It's an inconvenience at best, a twisted ankle waiting to happen at worst if you're not paying attention.
</BulletList>

### Today's Environmental Breakdown:

| Pollutant | Level/Reading | Notes        |
| :-------- | :------------ | :----------- |
| Pollen    | Low           | Easy breathing for allergy sufferers. |
| AQI       | 73 (Moderate) | Dominant pollutant: Ozone. Could impact sensitive groups. |
| Temperature | -5.3°C      | Clear, but prepare for very cold conditions. |

<AlertBox type="warning">
### **Watch Your Step, And Your Toes**
While the skies are clear, the temperature is seriously dipping. With a real feel that's likely much colder than the reported -5.3°C, exposed skin is at risk, and your muscles and joints will be tight. Dress in layers, cover all extremities, and for the love of all that is holy, *warm up properly*. Nobody wants a strained hamstring in February.

<AlertBox type="info">
### **Air Quality Check: Breathe Smart**
An AQI of 73 with Ozone as the main culprit isn't disastrous, but it's not pristine either. If you're generally sensitive to air quality or suffer from respiratory issues, maybe dial back the intensity or shorten your outdoor session today. Consider the University of Sherbrooke's outdoor track if you need a more controlled environment, but even then, the air's still the air.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
### **Downtown Disruption: Wellington South Closure**
Seriously, if your route takes you anywhere near Wellington South and Sanborn Street, be prepared. That section is closed down for construction until early April. While they say pedestrian access is maintained, expect obstacles, potential heavy equipment, and general chaos. If you're running, cycling, or even just walking, choose an alternate path. This isn't the day to try and weave through a construction site for your PR.
