Alright Saguenay, for February 26th, you *can* get outside, but you better bundle up and keep those lungs in mind.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is hitting that "moderate" zone, mainly due to ozone. If you're sensitive, or just pushing it hard, you'll feel it.</li>
  <li>It's clear, but let's be real, -8°C is chilly enough to freeze the snot right out of you. Dress in layers, cover your face.</li>
  <li>There was a power interruption yesterday in parts of Jonquière on streets like des Alouettes and des Hérons. While likely resolved by now, it's a reminder to be aware of your surroundings, especially if you're hitting those early morning or late evening miles where streetlights might still be wonky in localized spots.</li>
</BulletList>

Look, I've seen you all out there running in conditions that would make a polar bear reconsider its life choices. Today is no exception to the "it's cold in Saguenay in February" rule. The clear skies are a nice bonus, but don't let them fool you into thinking it's a walk in the park.

The biggest thing to pay attention to is that AQI of 72. "Moderate" isn't terrible, but with ozone being the main culprit, anyone with a bit of asthma or just generally delicate lungs needs to be smart. This isn't the day to try and set a personal best on the steep climbs up by the Parc national du Saguenay's Baie-Éternité sector if you're sucking wind like a vacuum cleaner. Take it easy, keep the intensity down, and if you start feeling any irritation, just turn around. Your lungs are not disposable.

<AlertBox type="info">
  Dress for the cold, folks. Multiple layers are your friend. Think wicking base layer, insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget proper gloves, a hat that covers your ears, and a neck gaiter or balaclava for face protection. Exposed skin is just asking for trouble at -8°C.
</AlertBox>

While there aren't any massive, widespread trail closures reported in the last 24 hours directly impacting our usual running routes, the Ville de Saguenay website always has that handy map for "entraves à la circulation" (traffic impediments). Given the constant infrastructure work around the city – like those ongoing projects on Autoroute 70 or Route 170 – it's always worth a quick check, especially if your route takes you near major roads or development areas. Better safe than rerouted by a bulldozer.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  With a moderate AQI and ozone as the dominant pollutant, consider reducing the intensity and duration of your outdoor workout, especially if you have respiratory sensitivities. Listen to your body – if your throat feels scratchy or your chest tight, head inside.
</AlertBox>

And a final thought: those spring icebreaking operations on the Saguenay Fjord start in early March. If you've been doing any ice fishing or venturing out on the Fjord ice, consider this your early warning: that ice won't be safe much longer. Stick to the solid ground.
