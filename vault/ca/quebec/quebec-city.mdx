Today is a day where the crisp air might tempt you out, but a few local headaches and the biting cold demand some serious thought before you lace up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   That "feels like" temperature is no joke. While the thermometer might say -4.4°C, it actually feels like a much more brutal -11°C out there. That's the kind of cold that gnaws at your exposed skin and makes your joints ache, especially if you're not properly layered.
*   Construction on our new tramway is kicking into high gear, with utility relocation impacting major downtown arteries like René-Lévesque Boulevard and 1st Avenue. Expect detours, uneven surfaces, and general chaos if your route takes you through these areas.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 73 AQI, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. It's not terrible, but if you're sensitive, you might notice it during a strenuous workout.
</BulletList>

## The Cold Reality Check

Don't let the "clear" skies fool you. Quebec City in late February means winter is still very much in charge. With the RealFeel temperature plunging to -11°C, your body is working overtime just to stay warm. This isn't just uncomfortable; it significantly increases your risk of frostbite on exposed skin and hypothermia if you're not dressed appropriately. Think layers, full coverage, and for the love of all that is holy, protect your head, hands, and feet. A good pair of winter running tights, a wind-resistant jacket, and thermal gloves are non-negotiable.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Caution: Extreme Cold & Wind Chill.** The "feels like" temperature of -11°C can cause frostbite in under 30 minutes on exposed skin. Limit outdoor exposure and dress in multiple layers, covering all skin.

## Downtown Digs and Dodgy Drainage

If your usual route takes you through the heart of the city, especially near René-Lévesque Boulevard or 1st Avenue, be ready for some serious navigational challenges. The tramway project's utility relocation work has just begun, meaning torn-up streets, equipment, and potential sidewalk closures. This isn't just an annoyance; it's a fall hazard waiting to happen, particularly with potentially icy or slushy patches. Your ankles will thank you for choosing a different path today.

And speaking of dodgy paths, there's an ongoing road closure on Access A-540 at chemin des Quatre-Bourgeois due to water accumulation. While not a trail, it highlights potential drainage issues around the city. Be mindful of unexpected puddles or icy patches on paths, especially those less travelled.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Hazard: Downtown Construction.** Utility relocation work for the tramway is active on René-Lévesque Boulevard and 1st Avenue. Expect significant disruptions, uneven terrain, and potential safety hazards for pedestrians and runners.

## Breathe Easy (Mostly)

The good news for your lungs is that pollen levels are low today. However, the Air Quality Index is moderate at 73, with ozone being the main culprit. For most, this won't be a major issue, but if you have respiratory sensitivities, consider toning down the intensity of your workout or opting for an indoor session.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Tip: Layer Up Strategically.** For these cold temperatures, moisture-wicking base layers, insulating mid-layers, and a windproof outer shell are your best friends. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and a neck gaiter to protect against wind chill.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, consider hitting the treadmill or doing some strength work indoors. Your lungs and joints will appreciate it, and you won't have to navigate a construction zone that looks like a warzone. If you must go out, be smart, be visible, and for Pete's sake, layer up!
