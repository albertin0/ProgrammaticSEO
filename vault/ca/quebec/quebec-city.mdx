If you're planning an outdoor workout in Quebec City today, February 26th, be prepared to earn it – this isn't for the faint of heart or the poorly dressed.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Brutal Cold & Wind Chill:** While the thermometer might say -5.7°C, that biting wind, gusting up to 38 km/h, will make it feel closer to -12°C to -15°C out there. Your lungs will burn, and your joints will protest if you don't warm up *properly*.
*   **Mediocre Air Quality:** An AQI of 79 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't terrible, but it's not exactly clean mountain air either. Those deep breaths during your run won't feel as crisp as you'd hope.
*   **Slippery Surprises:** We've got clear skies right now, but a bit of light snow is expected throughout the day. This, combined with existing ice, means black ice and slick patches are a real possibility on sidewalks and less-trafficked trails.
*   **Construction Chaos:** The city is gearing up for that tramway, and while full construction is slated for 2027, preparatory work is already causing disruptions. Expect detours and uneven surfaces on your usual city routes, especially if you're near major arteries like Laurier Boulevard.

### The Cold, Hard Truth for Runners (and Walkers)

Look, I get it. We're Québécois; we don't melt. But don't be a hero today, unless your idea of heroism involves frostbite. That -5.7°C temperature, coupled with the wind, makes for a seriously challenging run, especially on exposed areas like the Plains of Abraham. That open expanse is fantastic for avoiding traffic, but it turns into a wind tunnel when Mother Nature decides to crank up the fan.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Extreme Wind Chill Advisory:** Dress in layers, and I mean *layers*. Think wool, synthetic, windproof outer shell. Cover all exposed skin – hat, neck gaiter, insulated gloves or mittens are non-negotiable. Your ears and fingers will thank you. Seriously, losing a digit to prove a point isn't worth it.
</AlertBox>

The moderate AQI with ozone means if you have any respiratory sensitivities, today might be the day for an indoor workout. Pushing too hard with compromised air quality, especially in freezing temperatures, is just asking for a lung full of hurt. Your recovery will be longer, and your run won't feel nearly as good.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Watch for Black Ice:** With temperatures hovering below freezing and some light snow expected, assume every shadow could be a patch of black ice. Stick to well-plowed and salted routes if you can, and reconsider any technical trail running unless you've got serious grip on your footwear. A sprained ankle or worse on a frozen trail isn't anyone's idea of a good time.

And finally, if you're navigating the downtown core, be aware that the preliminary work for the tramway project means some street closures and lane reductions. What was once a smooth running path might now be a construction zone. Plan your route, or be prepared to improvise.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layering is Key:** Consider a base layer that wicks moisture, an insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget proper winter running shoes with good grip. And for the love of all that is holy, warm up indoors before you step out the door.
