Alright, Quebec City, listen up. Today isn't a *terrible* day to get out there, but you're gonna have to be smarter than usual about it. This isn't the kind of clear sky that means "go nuts."

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Lungs on Alert:** Our AQI is nudging into "Moderate" territory, and the culprit is fine particulate matter. Your lungs aren't going to be thrilled about a hard effort.
*   **Joints in Jeopardy:** While the official temperature is -8°C and clear, don't be fooled. Local forecasts from yesterday mentioned gusty winds making it *feel* colder, especially in the morning. Cold means your joints need a serious warm-up, or they'll let you know about it.
*   **Riverfront Rumble:** It's the "La Grande Virée des canotiers (Ice Canoe Race)" today. If you were planning a serene jog along the Promenade Samuel-De Champlain, expect crowds and potentially restricted access in some areas.

## Today's Local Lowdown: Quebec City

Look, I know you're itching to get your miles in, but let's be realistic. That clear sky is a nice visual, but the air itself isn't doing your lungs any favours today. An AQI of 61 with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant means you're breathing in microscopic crud that can irritate your respiratory system, especially when you're sucking wind on an incline. If you have any underlying respiratory issues, seriously reconsider pushing it hard.

The -8°C might seem manageable, but we've been in a cold snap, and wind chill is a real factor here, making it feel colder than the thermometer reads. This isn't just about comfort; it's about protecting your extremities and, yes, your lungs again. Cold air can be a bronchoconstrictor, meaning it can tighten your airways. If you're heading out, dress in layers like you're peeling an onion, and make sure that outer layer is wind-resistant.

### Construction & Events: Know Before You Go

Beyond the air you breathe and the chill in your bones, Quebec City is a constant construction zone, and today's no exception. The tramway project is kicking off its "intense preparatory work" this year. While full construction on the lines won't start until 2027, expect disruptions on major arteries like Laurier Boulevard, des Quatre-Bourgeois Road, and Chaudière Boulevard. It's not just for cars; sidewalks and paths around these areas can be impacted. Don't assume your usual route is clear.

And speaking of routes, if your training plan includes the waterfront, remember it's the Ice Canoe Race on the St. Lawrence today. The Promenade Samuel-De Champlain could be bustling with spectators and event logistics. You might find parts of it blocked or just too crowded to enjoy a steady pace. Have an alternative in mind, like perhaps hitting some of the less-trafficked side streets or embracing a loop in the Plains of Abraham if you want some space. Just watch for slippery patches; even with clear skies, melt-freeze cycles this time of year can turn a harmless puddle into a black ice trap.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Cold and Fine Particulates: Double Whammy for Lungs!** The combination of cold, potentially windy conditions and moderate AQI with fine particulate matter means your lungs are working overtime. Consider scaling back intense outdoor efforts today, especially if you have asthma or other respiratory sensitivities.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** While the city is clear, the freeze-thaw cycle typical for this time of year means sidewalks and trails can have unseen ice, especially in shaded areas. Spring thaw also means trails can be mucky and easily damaged. Stick to well-maintained, cleared surfaces.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Buttercup!** Even with "clear" skies, -8°C with potential wind chill is no joke. Think moisture-wicking base layers, an insulating mid-layer, and a wind/water-resistant outer shell. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and a neck gaiter to protect exposed skin.

It's Quebec City in late February. We're tough, but we're not invincible. Be smart, stay warm, and don't breathe too much of that particulate matter.
