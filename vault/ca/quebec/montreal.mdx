If you're looking for a perfect day to hit the pavement or trails, today isn't it, Montréal.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is just "meh"

<BulletList>
*   **Lungs feeling ozone:** That AQI is flirting with the "unhealthy for sensitive groups" territory thanks to ozone. You'll definitely notice it if you're pushing hard.
*   **Winter's last gasp (maybe):** While it's technically "clear" right now, the temperature is hanging just below freezing, and the wind is noticeable. The ground is still a minefield of potential ice patches from recent precipitation and melt-freeze cycles.
*   **Construction, always construction:** Seriously, does this city ever sleep? Road closures and detours are still the norm, even on major arteries.

## The Rundown: Don't Be a Hero

### Air Quality & Pollen
The air quality in Montreal today is sitting at an AQI of 79, which is in the moderate range. Your dominant pollutant is ozone, which for runners means your lungs might feel a bit more strained than usual, especially if you're prone to respiratory issues. It’s not a full-blown smog alert, but it's enough to make you think twice about setting a new personal best.

Pollen is low, so at least your sinuses get a break.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

### Weather & Trail Conditions
It’s -1.3°C out there, but with a slight breeze, it feels colder. While the sun *might* peek through, the underlying conditions are still classic late-winter Montreal. Be extremely cautious on sidewalks and less-travelled paths, especially shaded ones. We've seen enough freezing rain this winter to know how quickly things turn treacherous underfoot, and emergency rooms have been busy with related falls. If you're heading out towards Mount Royal Park, expect similar icy conditions on unmaintained or less-sanded trails.

**Watch Your Step! Icy Patches Galore.** Despite the sun, many surfaces will still be slick. Assume any wet patch is black ice. Your ankles will thank you.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert for Sensitive Lungs.** With an AQI of 79 and ozone as the main culprit, those with asthma or other respiratory sensitivities should consider an indoor workout, or at least take it easy and monitor symptoms.
</AlertBox>

### Construction & Closures
Good luck navigating the city without hitting an orange cone. Construction is a year-round sport here, and today is no different. We're still dealing with the fallout from the never-ending REM project, which means disruptions to public transit and surrounding roads. More locally, there are traffic obstructions today on **Avenue du Parc, between Rue Villeneuve and Avenue du Mont-Royal**, according to the City of Montreal's alerts. If your route takes you anywhere near there, plan for detours and uneven surfaces.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up & Stay Visible.** Dress for the "feels like" temperature, not just the thermometer. And with shorter daylight hours, remember reflective gear, especially around all those construction zones.
</AlertBox>

Look, I get it. We're all itching for spring. But pushing through these conditions can easily lead to a tweaked knee on some black ice or an irritated respiratory system. Listen to your body, not just your Strava segments.
