Look, winter isn't over just because you want it to be. Today's a mixed bag for hitting the streets or trails, leaning towards "bundle up and pay attention."

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   It's a frosty -6°C, but feeling like a bone-chilling -13°C. Your lungs will know it.
*   AQI is moderate at 73, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not terrible, but not pristine mountain air either.
*   Environment Canada issued a special weather statement yesterday for potential heavy flurries this evening, which means visibility could drop faster than a hot croissant, and surfaces might get slick.
*   Construction is still a Montreal constant, affecting sidewalks and routes, like the ongoing intervention on Milner.

## The Air Report

<AlertBox type="info">
Good news for the sniffly: Pollen levels are staying low today. So, at least your nose won't be staging a rebellion against your workout.
</AlertBox>

| Pollen Type  | Level |
| :----------- | :---- |
| Tree         | Low   |
| Grass        | Low   |
| Ragweed      | Low   |

## On the Ground (and in the Air)

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Don't Skimp on Layers, Folks.** It's -6°C out there, but with the wind, it feels like a bitter -13°C. Frostbite is a real thing, even on short runs. Cover all exposed skin. Also, be hyper-aware of black ice, especially on shaded paths around Mount Royal Park. Those flurries expected this evening could also reduce visibility rapidly, making footing tricky.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step (and Your Route).** Construction is a year-round sport in this city. There's ongoing work like the "public domain intervention" on Milner that's chewing up sidewalks and westbound lanes until today, February 27th. More long-term, the Côte-Saint-Luc overpass above the Décarie Expressway is undergoing repairs until the end of 2026, meaning partial closures and occasional sidewalk disruptions. Don't assume your usual path is clear. Check the Ville de Montréal's "Obstructions and work sites" map before you head out, unless you enjoy impromptu parkour.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Lungs Can Handle It, But Don't Push It.** An AQI of 73 is "moderate," driven by ozone. For most runners, this isn't a showstopper, but if you're sensitive, or if you're planning an exceptionally high-intensity workout, consider dialing it back slightly or sticking to indoors. No need to prove your toughness to your alveoli.
</AlertBox>

Stay warm, stay safe, and for god's sake, look where you're going.
