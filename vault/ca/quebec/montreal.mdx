It's another one of those "are you seriously going to do this?" days, Montreal. If you're heading out, you'd better be properly bundled, because Mother Nature isn't playing nice.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
  - Arctic air with a side of relentless wind is making it feel brutally cold out there.
  - Moderate air quality due to fine particulate matter means your lungs will notice the extra effort.
  - At least the pollen count is in the basement where it belongs for February.
</BulletList>

## Layer Up, Buttercup: It's a Windchill Wonderland

Look, I get it. We're Montrealers. We *do* winter. But today isn't just "brisk." With the mercury sitting around -3.6°C and gusty winds hitting up to 41 km/h, it’s going to feel like a solid -15°C out there. That's not just "cold," that's "your exposed skin will protest loudly" cold. This isn't the day to try and set any personal bests unless your PB involves seeing how fast you can turn blue. Save the speed work for the treadmill or, you know, June.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Extreme Cold & Windchill Alert!** With felt temperatures plummeting to -15°C, frostbite can set in faster than you can say "Je me souviens." Cover all exposed skin, seriously.
</AlertBox>

Your lungs will also be working overtime. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 66, with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. While it's not a full-blown wildfire smoke event like we've seen in past summers, it's still enough to irritate your airways, especially when you're sucking in that frigid air. Combine that with the cold, and you're asking for a wheezy workout. Environment Canada's Air Quality Health Index was at a "Low Risk" yesterday, but remember, "low risk" doesn't mean "no risk" when you're pushing hard.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Mind Your Lungs!** The moderate AQI from fine particulate matter, combined with the extreme cold, means intense outdoor efforts might irritate your respiratory system. Take it easy.
</AlertBox>

If you insist on hitting the trails, like the ones up on Mount Royal, be prepared. The scattered flurries expected this evening, combined with existing cold, could make for some slick patches. Don't assume that just because the main roads are cleared, the paths you love are too. Traction devices on your shoes wouldn't be the worst idea. While construction is an ongoing saga in this city, with sustained activity expected throughout 2026, there are no *new* specific trail closures that popped up in the last 24 hours to add to your misery today.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Winter Running Basics:** Dress in layers (wool, not cotton!), wear reflective gear if you're out near traffic, and make sure your head, hands, and feet are well-protected. Warm up *indoors* before you even step foot outside.
</AlertBox>

Good news for allergy sufferers, though: pollen is a non-issue today. That's about the only break you're getting.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Ragweed     | Low   |
| Mold        | Low   |

Stay safe out there, Montreal. Or just stay inside. No judgment here.
