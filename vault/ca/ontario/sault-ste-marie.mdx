Today's a tough call for hitting the Sault's trails; the crisp air comes with a serious bite and a side of dodgy footing.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
  <li>**Brutal Cold & Wind Chill:** While the sun might peek out later, the "feels like" temperature is dipping to a painful -17°C with light snow showers. That's not just "chilly," that's "get-frostbite-if-you're-not-careful" territory.</li>
  <li>**Unmaintained Winter Trails:** The City doesn't maintain most sections of the Hub Trail for winter use (outside of sidewalks), which means you're on your own with potential ice, compacted snow, and hidden hazards. Same goes for a lot of our other spots.</li>
  <li>**Moderate Air Quality:** An AQI of 72 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't terrible, but it's enough to notice if your lungs are working hard in this cold air.</li>

## The Lowdown on Running Sault Ste. Marie Today

Alright, fellow Sault Ste. Marie masochists, let's talk about putting miles in today. The good news? No apocalyptic smoke plumes, no major flooding from a sudden thaw (not yet, anyway), and pollen is effectively non-existent.

The bad news? Mother Nature still thinks it's mid-January. We're looking at clear conditions later, sure, but that -7.8°C feels more like -17°C thanks to the wind. If you're heading out, dress like you're planning an expedition to the Arctic, not a jog around the block. Layers are your friend, and for the love of all that is holy, cover your ears and face.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ### Ice and Unmaintained Trails Are No Joke
  Listen up, because this is where people get hurt. Most sections of the **Hub Trail** are *not* maintained during the winter. That smooth path you enjoy in summer? It's likely a mix of ice, slush, and uneven, packed snow. A section of the Plateau Trail in the **Fort Creek Conservation Area** is even formally closed due to safety concerns. You risk a sprained ankle, a broken wrist, or worse, if you're not paying attention to every single step. Assume anything not explicitly cleared is treacherous.
</AlertBox>

### Air Quality Check
The AQI is sitting at a "moderate" 72, with ozone being the main culprit. For most of us, this isn't going to send you to the ER, but if you've got asthma or sensitive lungs, combine this with the frigid air and you might feel it more than usual. Take it easy, don't push the pace too hard.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### Watch for Icy Patches, Especially in Shaded Areas
  Even if main roads seem clear, side streets, bike paths, and shaded sections of trails (or unmaintained parts of the Hub Trail) will likely be slick. Black ice is real, and it doesn't care about your PR. Factor in extra time and shorten your stride if you're on anything remotely questionable.

### Construction Updates? Not Today, Satan.
While Sault Ste. Marie City Council approved a budget that means ongoing road and construction projects for 2026, there are no specific new alerts from the last 24 hours that indicate current closures directly impacting most common workout routes in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. However, a general rule of thumb: always be aware of your surroundings and expect the unexpected, especially near major infrastructure work that might have started earlier in the season.

<AlertBox type="info">
  ### Hydration and Warm-Up are Still Key
  Even when it's freezing, you're sweating under those layers. Stay hydrated. And don't just jump into a cold run. A dynamic warm-up *indoors* will do wonders for your joints and muscles before you subject them to these temperatures. Your body will thank you, especially since I'm not doing free consults for preventable injuries.
