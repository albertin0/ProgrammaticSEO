Today's a mixed bag for hitting the trails, so pick your poison carefully, Sault Ste. Marie.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  - It's currently -5°C with a "Clear" sky, but don't let that fool you. Expect periods of light snow and flurries throughout the day and into tonight. Wind chill is making it feel more like -10°C, dropping to a bone-chilling -16°C overnight. Your exposed skin will be *screaming*.
  - Air quality is sitting at a moderate AQI of 72, with ozone being the main culprit. That means if your lungs are sensitive, you might feel it more than usual.
  - While major event blockages aren't an issue, several trails have ongoing closures, and the Sault Cycling Club has shut down all mountain biking trails at Hiawatha Highlands.

## Environmental Check

Here’s the breakdown of what's floating around (or not) in our frosty air:

| Pollutant      | Level |
| :------------- | :---- |
| Tree Pollen    | Low   |
| Grass Pollen   | Low   |
| Ragweed Pollen | Low   |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Brutal Cold & Moderate Air:** Dress for serious winter running. Layers, windproof outer shells, and covering exposed skin are non-negotiable. With an AQI of 72 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, those with respiratory issues should dial back the intensity or stick to indoor workouts today. Don't push it.

## Local Trail & Road Conditions

Forget about pushing your limits on two wheels at **Hiawatha Highlands** today, folks. The Sault Cycling Club has confirmed all mountain biking trails are currently closed. Save your wheels (and your bones) for another day.

If you're looking to hike, remember that sections of the **Voyageur Trail** (specifically the Harmony Section near Old Mill Bay and parts of the Echo Ridges Section near Peter Lake) are under permanent or until-further-notice closure due to logging and erosion. Seriously, don't try to "explore" past the signs. It's closed for a reason. Same goes for the erosion-prone Plateau Trail in the **Fort Creek Conservation Area** – it's been closed since 2014, and people keep messing with the barriers. Don't be that person.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Trail Closures are NOT Suggestions:** Respect the signs at Hiawatha Highlands, Voyageur Trail, and Fort Creek Conservation Area. These aren't minor inconveniences; they're about preventing injury or worse. "Logging operations" and "severe erosion" aren't things you want to mess with on your Saturday long run.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Heads Up for Sault Seal Recreation Area:** If tubing or sledding is your jam, the FAN Free Family Tubing & Sledding Night is happening from 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM today at Sault Seal Recreation Area. Expect crowds if you're planning on being in that vicinity this evening.
</AlertBox>

Road construction doesn't seem to be posing any *new* major workout-specific hazards in Sault Ste. Marie within the last 24 hours, though always keep an eye out for ongoing projects if your route takes you on city streets. The cold and potential for slippery patches from light snow are your bigger worries on paved surfaces.

Stay safe out there, or just stay inside and hit the treadmill. No judgment here.
