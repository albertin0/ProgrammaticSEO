Look, if you're planning a run outside today in the Soo, you'd better be truly dedicated or completely unhinged.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Arctic Blast:** It's a bone-chilling -11.3°C out there, feeling like a truly miserable -17°C with the wind. That's not just brisk; that's "get frostbite if you're not careful" cold. Your lungs are going to hate you, and your joints will be stiff enough to make you feel 90 before you even hit the end of your driveway.
*   **Icy Treachery:** While it's currently showing light snow, Environment Canada issued special weather statements for Sault Ste. Marie just a couple of days ago regarding a fast-moving snowstorm and expected snow squalls. The city even declared a "Significant Weather Event" on February 18 and January 20. This means the roads and especially sidewalks are still likely to be a slick, icy minefield under any fresh dusting.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is sitting at 76, which is "Moderate," with ozone being the dominant pollutant. It's not a red alert, but it's certainly not doing your respiratory system any favours when you're trying to push the pace.

### Weather & Air Quality Breakdown

| Metric             | Value               | Notes                                                                                                    |
| :----------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Temperature**    | -11.3°C             | Feels like -17°C. That's dangerously cold.                                                     |
| **Condition**      | Light Snow          | Snow showers are possible, further complicating already icy surfaces.                          |
| **AQI**            | 76 (Moderate)       | Dominant pollutant: Ozone. Sensitive individuals should take note, especially with hard efforts.           |
| **Pollen Level**   | Low                 | The one silver lining.                                                                                   |

**Extreme Cold Warning: Your Skin Will Thank You (For Staying Inside)**
With temperatures feeling like -17°C, exposed skin can freeze in minutes. Dress in multiple layers, cover every inch of skin, and seriously consider if that outdoor PR is worth a trip to the hospital. Your core temperature will drop faster than your motivation on a long hill.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step on the Hub Trail**
Forget setting any speed records today, especially on areas like the Hub Trail along the waterfront. The combination of recent snow, freezing temperatures, and potential light snowfall means you're almost guaranteed to encounter black ice and uneven, slippery surfaces. A twisted ankle or worse will put you out of commission for a lot longer than one missed workout. Slow down, shuffle, and wear proper traction.

**Layer Up, Buttercup!**
If you absolutely *must* get out, think layers. Wicking base layer, insulating mid-layer, and a windproof/water-resistant outer shell. Don't forget a hat that covers your ears, a neck gaiter or balaclava, insulated gloves or mitts, and warm, moisture-wicking socks. This isn't a fashion show; it's self-preservation.
