Alright, let's cut to the chase: Today's one of those North Bay days where if you *have* to get outside, you can, but don't pretend it's optimal.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That -7.6°C might look mild on the thermometer compared to our usual deep-winter misery, but with the wind, it'll still feel like someone slapped you with a frozen fish. Layer up, seriously.
*   The Air Quality Index is creeping into "Moderate" territory, specifically for ozone. If you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel this one a bit more than usual.
*   Construction on the multi-use path connecting Champlain Park to the Omischl Sports Complex is still in full swing, and it's explicitly closed for your safety. Don't be "that guy" who ignores the signs and ends up in a ditch.
</BulletList>

## The Rundown

The sun's out, which is a rare enough treat in late February that it almost makes you forget it's still colder than a witch's... well, you get it. We're looking at -7.6°C, but that "feels like" temperature is going to be lower, so assume your exposed skin will protest pretty quickly. There's a low chance of light snow later, but for now, it's just plain cold and clear.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Ice, You Klutz
Even though it's clear, previous freeze-thaw cycles mean any unplowed or unmaintained paths are probably skating rinks under a dusting of whatever snow we *did* get. Think about those knee ligaments before you decide to bomb down an icy hill on the Kate Pace Way. It's picturesque, sure, but a slip and fall on frozen pavement sucks the joy right out of the view. Your physio bill won't be pretty.
</AlertBox>

### Air Quality & Your Lungs

The AQI is currently sitting at 72, which Environment Canada generously calls "Moderate." The dominant pollutant floating around is ozone. While it's not "stay indoors and seal the windows" bad, if you're prone to respiratory issues, or you're planning a particularly intense interval session, you might feel a bit more chest irritation than on a perfectly crisp day. It's a reminder that even in winter, our air isn't always perfectly clean.

Here's the current pollen situation, just for kicks:

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Low          | None          |

### Trail Closures & Construction: Don't Be Dumb

This is where it gets real, folks. The ongoing multi-year project to build that new multi-use path connecting Champlain Park to the Omischl Sports Complex on Lakeshore Drive is still underway. As of late last year, the trail was explicitly *closed during construction for safety reasons*, and that work is expected to continue into this year. Don't assume "almost done" means "open for your selfie session."

<AlertBox type="danger">
### CLOSED: Champlain Park to Omischl Sports Complex Path
Seriously, do NOT try to navigate the construction zone between Champlain Park and the Omischl Sports Complex. They closed it for a reason. Ignoring posted closures isn't just rude; it's a direct invitation for a preventable injury, or worse, to become a construction worker's unexpected obstacle. Find another route, or stick to the parts of the city that are actually open.
</AlertBox>

Other construction, like the Premier Road improvements, still has pedestrian access maintained, but expect gravel surfaces and potential delays. Just be aware of your surroundings and any equipment.

### Winter Running Gear Reminder
Even if it's "just" -7.6°C, dressing in layers is non-negotiable. Wind-resistant outer shell, moisture-wicking base, and don't forget good gloves, a hat, and appropriate footwear with decent grip. Those tiny hand warmers actually work wonders.
