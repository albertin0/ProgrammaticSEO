Don't let that clear sky fool you, North Bay – today's a classic example of "looks can be deceiving" when it comes to getting outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   While it's currently hovering just above freezing, a nasty wind chill is rolling in tonight, bringing a significant risk of frostbite.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 67 AQI due to ozone, so if your lungs are sensitive, you'll feel it.
*   Fluctuating temperatures mean anything not directly hit by sun is likely a skating rink in disguise, especially on less-trafficked paths.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The sun's out, and you've been cooped up. But before you lace up those runners for a long haul on the Kate Pace Way, take a real look at what's happening. The current temperature is a deceptive 0.2°C, but that's a fleeting moment. By tonight, Environment Canada is calling for a low of minus 23 degrees Celsius with a wind chill making it feel like minus 29. That's not just "chilly," folks; that's prime frostbite territory in minutes if you're not properly covered.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Cold and Wind Chill Tonight!**
Environment Canada is predicting wind chills near minus 29 degrees Celsius overnight, with a significant risk of frostbite. If you're heading out after dark, seriously reconsider your plans or bundle up like you're trekking the Arctic. Exposed skin is a no-go.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the air. A moderate AQI of 67, with ozone as the dominant pollutant, means some of us might experience respiratory irritation. It's not a smoke advisory, but it's enough to make you work a little harder for that breath, especially if you're pushing the pace. Combine that with the cold, and your lungs will certainly get a workout – maybe not the good kind.

Those slightly milder days we've had recently mean the city's outdoor rinks have had their hockey nets temporarily removed due to soft ice. What does this mean for our running trails? It means those shady spots, the hidden corners of parks, and especially any low-lying areas are probably glazed with a layer of treacherous ice. A clear path can turn into an ER visit in a heartbeat if you hit an unseen patch. Keep your eyes peeled and maybe opt for some trail spikes or just stick to well-salted sidewalks today.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality (AQI 67 - Ozone)**
While not severe, today's air quality is moderate due to ozone. Individuals with respiratory sensitivities or those planning high-intensity, prolonged outdoor activity should be aware. Listen to your body and adjust your workout as needed.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress in Layers & Watch Your Step!**
With temperatures dropping sharply tonight, layers are crucial. Think wind-resistant outer shells. Also, assume all wet patches are ice, especially where the sun doesn't hit. Stick to well-maintained routes if you can, or slow down and stay vigilant on trickier terrains.
