Today's a mixed bag, folks. If you're tough enough for the cold and can navigate some pretty significant trail closures, then get after it. Otherwise, maybe stick to the treadmill.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   It's a clear day, but don't let that fool you; it's still biting cold out there at -6.1°C. Layer up or stay inside.
*   Air quality is sitting at a 'moderate' 73 AQI, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not terrible, but definitely not ideal for pushing big miles, especially if your lungs are sensitive.
*   Major sections of our favourite outdoor routes are *still* closed. Seriously, again with the closures?

## Pickering Winter Grind: Cold, Clear, and Closed Trails

Alright Pickering, it's Thursday, February 26th, and if you're looking to get your kilometres in, you're going to need a good attitude and some serious layers. That -6.1°C might look mild on the thermometer compared to those deep-freeze warnings we had earlier in the week, but trust me, it’s still cold enough to bite if you’re not prepared.

### The Air You Breathe (or Don't)

The air quality today is clocking in at a 'moderate' 73 AQI, with ozone taking the lead as the primary pollutant. For most of us, this is probably just background noise, but if you've got any kind of respiratory issues, you'll definitely feel it. You might want to dial back the intensity or choose an indoor option if you're prone to lung complaints.

<AlertBox type="info">
**AQI Tip:** Moderate AQI means acceptable air quality, but there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution. Listen to your body and adjust your activity level if needed.

### Where to Actually Run (and Where Not To)

This is where it gets frustrating. If you're a regular on the **Great Lakes Waterfront Trail**, especially near Rouge Beach, you're still out of luck. That entire section, including the pedestrian bridge over the Rouge River, is *closed* for the "Rouge Beach Improvements Project" and isn't slated to reopen until Spring 2027. Pickering Council themselves called out Parks Canada for not properly communicating these closures and the 'impractical' detours, so you know it's a mess. Don't even bother heading that way unless you enjoy scaling fences or adding serious, unplanned detours to Kingston Road.

Adding to the list of "nope, not today," **Beachpoint Park** is also temporarily closed due to plumbing issues. Seriously, what’s with all the infrastructure woes this winter?

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Trail Closure Alert:** The Rouge Beach and Great Lakes Waterfront Trail section near the Rouge River is CLOSED until Spring 2027 due to construction. Detours are in place but are reportedly impractical. Avoid this area for your safety and sanity.

On the bright side, pollen levels are low, so at least your sinuses won't be adding to your misery today.

| Pollutant          | Level  |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| Tree Pollen        | Low    |
| Grass Pollen       | Low    |
| Ragweed Pollen     | Low    |
| Mold Spores        | Low    |
| Pet Dander         | Low    |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Winter Running Reminder:** Despite the clear skies, -6.1°C can still lead to frostbite on exposed skin in short order, especially with any wind chill. Dress in layers, cover your extremities, and consider shortening your outdoor time. Your fingers and toes will thank you.
</AlertBox>

Stay safe out there, Pickering. Maybe today's a good day for some hill repeats on a local street, or a nice, long indoor spin.
