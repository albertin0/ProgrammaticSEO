Alright, Sarnia, if you're looking to pound some pavement today, February 28, 2026, it's a decent enough day, but don't slack on checking your evening plans.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
  - Clear skies and low pollen levels mean your allergies won't be staging a coup.
  - Moderate air quality due to nitrogen dioxide might be a slight drag on your lungs, especially if you're pushing it.
  - Watch out for localized crowds and possible detours this evening with the "Coldest Night of the Year" charity walks happening.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe & The Pollen That Doesn't Threaten (Much)

Let's talk about the invisible stuff first. Pollen is playing nice today, sitting at a "Low" level. If you're usually sniffling and sneezing your way through spring, you've got a reprieve.

| Pollen Level | Status |
| :----------: | :----: |
|     Low      |   👍   |

However, the air quality isn't exactly pristine. We're clocking in with an AQI of 79, which is squarely in the "moderate" category. The dominant pollutant is nitrogen dioxide. This isn't great, particularly if you've got existing respiratory issues or you're planning an intense session. That burning sensation in your lungs might be more than just lactic acid, so pay attention.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Moderate Air Quality Alert:** With an AQI of 79 and nitrogen dioxide as the primary culprit, sensitive groups should consider taking it easy. Even if you're not sensitive, prolonged high-intensity outdoor activity could be more taxing on your respiratory system today.

## Weather: A Tale of Two Halves

Right now, we're looking at a clear 5.1°C, which is pretty decent for a late February run. The sun's out, and that always helps with morale. But don't get too comfortable in your shorts and a tank. Environment Canada's got a forecast saying it'll get cloudy later, with a chance of flurries, and temperatures dropping to a chilly -8°C tonight. So, if your workout stretches into the evening, layer up, folks. Don't be that person shivering at the finish line because you forgot Sarnia weather is fickle.

## Local Rundown: Watch Out for the Good Samaritans

Here's the real kicker for your workout plans today: the "Coldest Night of the Year" charity walks are on! This is great for the community, but it means certain areas are going to be bustling with walkers.

One of the walks kicks off in **Mitton Village**, starting and ending at River City Vineyard on Mitton Street North. Another walk is happening down by Sarnia's waterfront, starting and finishing at the Polish Hall Sarnia on Exmouth Street. Both events begin registration at 4 p.m. with the walks starting at 5 p.m.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Heads Up, Walkers & Runners!** If your route takes you through Mitton Village or along the waterfront near Exmouth Street this evening, expect significant pedestrian traffic and potential detours due to the "Coldest Night of the Year" charity walks. Be respectful, share the path, and maybe plan an alternate route if you're aiming for a PR.
</AlertBox>

No major road closures from construction impacting general outdoor activity were reported in the last 24 hours, which is a small victory for your usual routes. Just keep an eye out for those charity walk crowds and the rapidly falling temperatures post-sunset.
