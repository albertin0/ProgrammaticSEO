Today is a day you *can* get out there, but seriously, don't be a hero and dress like you're trekking the Arctic.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
  - It's colder than a polar bear's toenails out there, especially with the wind. Expect that "feels like" temperature to hit you.
  - Air quality is just "okay" thanks to some ozone, so don't expect to set any PRs with perfectly clear lungs.
  - Still some lingering ice and slick spots from previous blizzards, so watch your footing.

## The Chilly Truth About Today's Sarnia Workout

Alright, Sarnia. February 26th, 2026, and it's a typical late-winter morning, meaning it's clear but absolutely *brutal* outside if you're not layered up. The thermometer's showing -8.3°C, but that wind is making it feel more like -14°C. Let that sink in. Your lungs are going to get a shock if you just burst out the door in shorts and a t-shirt. Common sense, people.

The air quality is sitting at a moderate 71 AQI, with ozone being the main culprit. That's not terrible, but it's not doing you any favours when you're sucking wind on a tempo run along the Bayfront. Your lungs will be working hard enough to warm that frigid air without extra pollutants bothering them.

  ### Extreme Cold Warning (Your Face Will Thank You)
  While there are no official weather *alerts* in effect right now for Sarnia - Petrolia - Western Lambton County, that -14°C "feels like" temperature is no joke. Exposed skin can get frostbitten faster than you can say "Lake Huron whiteout." Cover up every bit of skin: gloves, hat, neck gaiter, and don't forget good face protection. Your nose hairs will freeze, trust me.

  ### Watch for Lingering Ice & Snow Patches
  We've had some significant snow and ice events recently in Lambton County, including blizzards earlier in the month and snow squalls just yesterday that caused near-zero visibility. Even with clear skies today, road crews were still tackling stubborn patches of hard-packed snow and ice on some county roads as of February 9th. So, while the main routes might be clear, any side trails, less-travelled sidewalks, or shaded areas, especially around the Canatara Park trails, could still be incredibly slick. Assume there's black ice lurking.

  ### Howard Watson Trail: Plan Your Route Carefully
  If you're heading out to hit the dirt, remember a section of the Howard Watson Nature Trail, specifically from Quinn Drive to Exmouth Street, has been closed for the Rapids Parkway Expansion since August 2023 and will remain closed into the fall. Don't just show up and expect to seamlessly continue your long run. There are detours, but know your route beforehand so you don't end up frustrated and adding extra, unplanned kilometers to your freezing cold run.
