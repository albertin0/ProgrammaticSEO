Alright, Windsor, let's talk. Today is one of those days where you really need to question your life choices before lacing up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** While Environment Canada might be calling the Air Quality Health Index "Low Risk", the actual AQI clocking in at 73 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't exactly "ideal for outdoor activities" for everyone. If you've got lungs, you'll feel it if you push too hard.
*   **Wind Chill is a Reality Check:** We might be sitting at 6.1°C right now, but those west winds, gusting up to 40 km/h, are bringing the "feels like" temperature down to a bracing minus 7°C this afternoon. Your exposed skin and stiff joints will notice.
*   **Watch for Snow and Slop:** The forecast calls for periods of snow tonight, which means if you're planning an evening or late afternoon run, you're looking at potentially slicker conditions and less-than-stellar footing.
*   **Construction Never Sleeps:** Specifically, be mindful of ongoing watermain reconstruction around Askin Avenue, which has been active since the week of February 23rd and is slated to continue through July. This could mean detours, uneven surfaces, or general inconvenience if your route goes through there.

## The Rundown

So, you still wanna go for it? Fine. Just don't say I didn't warn you when your lungs burn a little and your knees ache more than usual.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Wind Chill & Ozone Combo
That "Moderate" AQI of 73 from Ozone isn't going to kill you, but it's not doing your respiratory system any favours, especially when combined with a real-feel temperature pushing well below freezing. Don't be a hero; keep your efforts moderate, especially if you're prone to breathing issues. Consider dialling back your usual pace on the Riverfront Trail if you're sensitive to the air or cold.

### Dress for the *Real* Temperature
Layer up. And I mean properly. Wind-resistant outer shell, technical fabrics underneath. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and something to cover your face. That -7°C wind chill is no joke. I've seen too many people out there looking like they're headed to the beach, then wondering why their fingers are numb after a kilometre.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Evening Slush Watch
With snow expected to start falling tonight, those clear roads and trails you see now might not be so accommodating later. If you're running after sunset, assume anything not actively plowed will be slushy, icy, or just generally miserable. This especially goes for less-maintained paths or sidewalks on side streets near areas like Askin Avenue where construction is already messing things up.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### "Coldest Night of the Year" Event
Just a heads up: the "Coldest Night of the Year" event is happening this evening from 4:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. This charity walk/run for homelessness typically draws a crowd and uses local routes, so if you're navigating downtown or areas where such events usually take place, expect increased pedestrian traffic.
