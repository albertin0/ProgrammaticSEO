Alright, Windsor, if you're thinking of lacing up today, brace yourself for a chill that'll cut right through your "good intentions" running tights.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky is fooling precisely no one; morning wind chills were a brutal -15°C across Windsor-Essex. Your face is going to hate you.
*   While the pollen count is doing us a solid, the air quality isn't exactly pristine.
*   Construction on Askin Avenue means some routes are already a mess. Plan your dodgeball maneuvers accordingly.
</BulletList>

## The Grim Details

So, the weather apps are calling it "Clear" and 0.4°C, which sounds deceptively benign, doesn't it? Don't fall for it. The reality is that we woke up to wind chills feeling more like -15°C this morning. That's the kind of cold that turns your snot into icicles and makes your lungs feel like they're trying to breathe razor blades. Even with the sun supposedly making an appearance, those wind gusts are going to ensure you feel every single degree below zero.

### Air Quality & Allergy Report

Our environmental data shows an AQI of 65, with inhalable particulate matter as the dominant pollutant. This puts us squarely in the "Moderate" category. However, Environment Canada's Air Quality Health Index for Windsor is currently sitting at a 3, which they deem "Low Risk" for outdoor activities. Pick your poison, I guess. If you've got existing lung issues, pay attention to how you feel, but for most of us, your bigger problem is going to be the cold, not the invisible stuff in the air.

<AlertBox type="info">
Remember that while the general AQHI is low risk, if you're feeling anything beyond your usual exertion, listen to your body. No PR is worth a trip to the ER.

Here's the lowdown on the pollen, which at least is behaving itself:

| Pollen Type  | Level |
|--------------|-------|
| Tree         | Low   |
| Grass        | Low   |
| Weed         | Low   |

### Road & Trail Hazards

Now, for those of you trying to get your miles in, watch your step. Yesterday brought a risk of freezing drizzle, and with overnight lows dipping well below freezing, you can bet there are still some slick spots out there, especially in shaded areas or on less-travelled paths. If you're anywhere near the riverfront trails like those leading to the Windsor Sculpture Park, expect some icy patches where the melt from yesterday refroze.

Speaking of hazards, the City of Windsor's got construction happening. For instance, watermain reconstruction kicked off the week of February 23rd on **Askin Avenue**, and that's expected to run until July. While this is more of a road issue than a trail one, it means traffic detours and potentially messy sidewalks. Don't be that runner who gets taken out by a poorly placed construction barrel because you weren't looking up.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Expect localized icy patches on ungritted sidewalks and trails, especially early morning or in shaded areas. That surprise slip-and-slide could lead to a very unwelcome physio appointment.

## Your Call

Look, it's not the worst day, but it's certainly not a picnic. The air is okay, the pollen is non-existent, but that biting wind chill is a real factor. If you're heading out, dress in layers, cover exposed skin, and assume every dark patch could be ice. Nobody needs a broken wrist or a lung infection from trying to prove a point to Mother Nature.
