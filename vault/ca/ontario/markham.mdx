Look, if you're absolutely itching to get outside today, February 28th, Markham isn't exactly throwing a parade, but it's not a total wash either.

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" weather report at 3.7°C sounds inviting, but remember it's still late winter in Markham. Expect lingering ice and slush, especially in shaded areas or on less-travelled paths. Think "black ice" near the Rouge Valley Trail's less exposed sections – it'll get you when you least expect it.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 74 AQI, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. For most folks, a quick jog might be fine, but if you're prone to respiratory issues, or planning anything beyond an easy pace, your lungs might not thank you.
*   Pollen is low, so at least your sinuses can breathe a sigh of relief, even if your lungs are dealing with ozone.

## Today's Rundown: Clear Skies, Hidden Hazards

It's 3.7°C and "clear" out there, which sounds lovely on paper for a late February run or ride. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's springtime hero weather. We've had a few significant weather events recently, dumping snow and freezing rain on us earlier this month and in January. While today's temperature is above freezing, those hidden patches of ice love to hang around, especially on the winding parts of trails like the Rouge Valley Trail where the sun doesn't hit directly. You know the drill: one minute you're cruising, the next you're doing an unplanned split.

Then there's the air. A moderate AQI of 74 with ozone as the primary irritant means it's not terrible, but it's not exactly pristine mountain air either. Ozone can feel like a dull ache in your chest, especially if you're pushing hard. If you find yourself sucking wind faster than usual, ease off. This isn't the day to set a new personal best for sustained effort.

**Watch Your Step!** Even with temperatures above freezing, icy patches are a real threat on sidewalks and trails. Assume every shaded spot could be slick, especially where snow has melted and refrozen.

Construction is always a thing in Markham. While nothing new and immediately hazardous popped up in the last 24 hours, the city's always working on improving roads and trails, like the ongoing bike lane upgrades and phases of the Markham Centre Trails. Keep an eye out for detour signs or uneven surfaces, especially around intersections that are slated for future work.

**Listen to Your Lungs:** Given the moderate ozone levels, pay extra attention to your breathing. If you experience any unusual chest tightness or coughing, dial back your intensity or consider taking your workout indoors today.
