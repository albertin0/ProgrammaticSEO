Alright, Vaughan. Today's not too shabby for a February sprint, but don't get complacent.

<LungsJointsScore score={6.5} />

<BulletList>
  <li>**Air Quality on the Edge:** Your lungs might feel that AQI creep, especially if you're pushing pace.</li>
  <li>**Winter's Last Gasp (Maybe):** Today's mild, but the trails are a ticking time bomb for ice tonight.</li>
  <li>**Low Pollen Perks:** At least your sinuses get a break.</li>
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. After a week of whatever winter threw at us – snow, then ice, then a brief tease of warmth – today, February 28, 2026, actually looks… clear. The mercury is sitting at a respectable 4.5°C. You might be eyeing those trails at Boyd Conservation Area thinking it's your chance to finally stretch out without dodging icy patches or getting blasted by freezing rain. Go ahead, get out there, but keep your head on a swivel.

The air quality, while not screaming "stay inside," is hovering at a Moderate AQI of 77, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. For most of us, that's fine for a casual walk, but if you're asthmatic or have sensitive airways and you're planning on hammering out some intervals, you might notice it. It's that subtle irritation that can turn a good run into a wheezy struggle.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Moderate Air Quality Alert:** With an AQI of 77 and Ozone as the primary culprit, sensitive individuals might experience respiratory symptoms during strenuous outdoor activity. Consider adjusting your intensity or duration if you feel it.

Now, about those "clear" conditions: Mother Nature's a fickle beast, especially this time of year. While today is looking bright, Environment Canada is calling for a low of -11°C tonight with a 60% chance of snow. That means anything wet on the ground, whether it's melted snow from earlier this week or just general dampness, is going to freeze solid overnight. If you're planning an early morning run tomorrow (Sunday, March 1), assume black ice is everywhere until proven otherwise. Even today, shaded spots, especially those northern exposures at Boyd, could still be holding onto some slickness from yesterday's cloudiness and potential lingering moisture.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Overnight Freeze Warning:** What's clear and tolerable today will likely be icy and dangerous by Sunday morning. Any moisture on trails or sidewalks will freeze solid as temperatures plummet to -11°C tonight with a chance of snow. Plan accordingly for tomorrow if you value your knees.

On the bright side, pollen is low. So, at least your eyes won't be watering for *that* reason.

Finally, if you were worried about events or construction blocking your favourite route, most of the recent road closure updates, like the one on Portage Parkway at Millway Avenue, wrapped up yesterday. No major events are slated to clog up the streets of Vaughan today. But seriously, wear layers, stay hydrated, and don't assume that just because it's clear now, it'll be friendly for your joints later.
