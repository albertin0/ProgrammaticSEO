Alright, Vaughan, listen up. Today's one of those "get out there, but don't be stupid" kind of days.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is creeping into "moderate" territory, driven by ozone. Not ideal for hammering those intervals.
*   It's clear out, but let's be real, -3.3°C still means your fingers and toes will complain if you're not bundled correctly.
*   Major road construction is a permanent fixture around here, still wreaking havoc on routes and making even a simple run a game of dodge-the-barricade.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality & Respiratory Rants

Your lungs are getting a decent, but not great, deal today. An AQI of 76 means we're in the "moderate" zone, with ozone being the main culprit. If you've got any kind of lung funk – asthma, bronchitis, or you just smoked too much in your younger years – you'll feel this more than others. It's not a "stay inside and bubble wrap yourself" alert, but it's definitely a "don't push your hardest pace" kind of day, especially on those main drags where car exhaust just adds to the atmospheric soup.

### Weather Whiplash (or lack thereof, for now)

We're sitting at a brisk -3.3°C and thankfully, it's clear. No blizzards or ice storms to report in the immediate forecast from what I'm seeing for *today*. This means stable footing for the most part, which is a win in late February. But don't let that "clear" deceive you into thinking it's balmy. That wind chill, even without a formal warning, can still bite. Remember, hypothermia isn't just for climbing Everest; it can happen in your own backyard if you're unprepared.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Layer up properly, especially for any runs longer than a quick dash to grab the mail. Think wicking layers, a good outer shell, and don't forget insulated gloves and a hat. Your extremities are the first to suffer.

### Construction Chaos: The Never-Ending Story

Here's the real kicker for anyone trying to get some mileage in: the construction. It’s an election-year promise and a decade-long reality. As of February 2026, you're still dealing with Rutherford Road being reduced to one lane in each direction near the CN rail bridge, and that's expected to continue through Fall 2026. Same goes for stretches of Major Mackenzie Drive and Dufferin Street, not to mention the Highway 400 widening project. If your usual loop takes you anywhere near these arterial roads, prepare for detours, uneven surfaces, and a lot of frustrated drivers who aren't looking out for you.

<AlertBox type="danger">
Avoid running directly on major construction zones like Rutherford Road unless absolutely necessary. Sidewalks can be abruptly closed, and visibility for drivers is often compromised. Plan alternate routes through quieter residential areas or parks like Boyd Conservation Area, but even there, watch for patchy ice in shaded areas.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
If you *must* run near construction, wear bright, reflective gear, and assume no one sees you. Carry your phone, tell someone your route, and for the love of all that is holy, take off those headphones so you can actually hear what's going on around you.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

Low pollen is a small blessing, at least your sinuses won't be staging a rebellion today.

Stay safe out there, Vaughan. Don't be a hero; be smart.
