Look, if you absolutely *must* get out there today, you'd better bundle up like you're heading to the Arctic, because Vaughan is serving up a real lung-freezer.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   That "feels like" temperature is no joke; your joints are going to hate you without proper warm-up and layers.
*   The Air Quality Index is hovering at "moderate" thanks to ozone, so your lungs are already working harder than they should be.
*   While the skies are clear, residual ice and unseen black ice are always a factor on our local pathways this time of year.
</BulletList>

Alright, Vaughan, let's cut to the chase. Today, February 26th, is one of those days where your outdoor workout plan needs a serious reality check. The official temperature might be sitting at a brisk -7.9°C, but with the wind chill, it's going to feel more like -14°C to -19°C out there. That's not just "chilly," that's "your-nostrils-will-stick-together" cold, and it's a prime recipe for some nasty frostbite if you're not careful.

If you're thinking of hitting the Bartley Smith Greenway, or any of our other otherwise fantastic trails like the William Granger Greenway, think twice before you just throw on a hoodie. The combination of that deep cold and any lingering patches of ice, especially in shaded areas or under the pedestrian bridge crossings, could turn a scenic run into an express trip to my office for a sprained ankle. The City of Vaughan declared a "significant weather event" a few weeks back due to a major snowstorm, and while the bulk of that is cleared, hidden hazards persist.

On top of the cold, our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 76, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Now, I'm not saying wear a full-on respirator for your usual loop, but if you've got any underlying respiratory issues, today might be the day to keep your intervals on the treadmill. Your lungs are already working overtime to warm that frozen air; adding ozone to the mix isn't doing them any favours.

Here's the deal: I get it. You've got goals. But pushing through this kind of cold without proper precautions is just stupid, and I say that as someone who's run too many winter marathons and ended up with snotcicles.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Cold Alert:** The "feels like" temperature can lead to frostbite in minutes on exposed skin. Cover *everything*: face, ears, hands, and don't forget good, warm socks. Think layers, layers, layers.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Slippery Surfaces:** Even if it looks clear, assume there's black ice lurking. Take shorter strides, keep your gaze up, and if you're hitting the trails, consider footwear with extra grip, or even those micro-spikes for serious traction.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Zone Awareness:** While no specific trail closures were reported in the last 24 hours, York Region does have ongoing road construction projects across Vaughan, including Dufferin Street and Major Mackenzie Drive. Keep an eye out for detour signs or reduced accessibility if your route involves crossing or running alongside these areas.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| General     | Low   |

The low pollen count is about the only good news your allergies are getting today, but it's hardly enough to offset the other factors.

Seriously, be smart. A hero in the cold is just a patient in my office come Monday.
