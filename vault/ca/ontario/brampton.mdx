Today? Unless you're chasing that "ice beard" aesthetic, maybe consider the treadmill.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Deep Freeze & Impending Slush:** It’s a brisk -3.1°C out there, and Environment Canada's issued a special weather statement for 5-10 cm of snow tonight. That means anything you hit the pavement for this evening will likely be on tricky, accumulating snow. Say goodbye to traction, say hello to potential slips and joint complaints.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** Our AQI is clocking in at 72, with ozone leading the charge. Not terrible, but if your lungs are easily irritated, you might feel it. Don't expect pristine air while you're sucking it in.
*   **Active Public Safety Alert:** There's a Canada-wide warrant out for a suspect in a deadly shooting from last August, with recent news updates tied to the Castlemore Road and Humberwest Parkway area. Stay aware of your surroundings, folks.
</BulletList>

Look, Brampton, it's February, so we expect some bite in the air. But today, you've got to contend with more than just the cold. That -3.1°C temperature combined with whatever wind decides to whip up means that "feels like" temperature is going to plummet. If you're heading out for a run, particularly near any of the trails that might not be perfectly cleared, you're playing a guessing game with black ice under that fresh powder. Roads and walkways are "likely to be difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow" later.

If your usual route takes you anywhere near the Castlemore Road and Humberwest Parkway vicinity, maybe reroute today. Seriously. There's a wanted individual considered "armed and dangerous" and police are still seeking public assistance in locating him. Your PR isn't worth putting yourself in a sketchy situation.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Cold and Ice
With temperatures stubbornly below freezing and snow forecast for tonight, watch for icy patches. That "clear" sky won't last, and even a thin layer of snow can hide a nasty slip hazard. Layers are your friend, and consider trail shoes for better grip, even on paved paths.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Construction Zone Awareness
While not directly impacting trails *today*, remember the ongoing Metrolinx LRT construction on Hurontario Street. Always be mindful of active construction sites and detours, as they can pop up with little notice and reroute your workout. Also, the Westcreek Blvd Multi-use Path construction is slated to start March 31, 2026, so be aware of future impacts in that area.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Public Safety Alert: Castlemore Road Area
Police are actively seeking a suspect from a deadly August 2025 shooting near Castlemore Road and Humberwest Parkway. If you're in this area, exercise extreme caution and situational awareness. Your workout isn't worth risking your personal safety.
