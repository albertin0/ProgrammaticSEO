It's cold out there, Whitby, so unless you actually enjoy the sensation of your snot freezing in your nose, maybe take it easy today.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   It's clear, but that -6.9°C chill bites hard, and it's not doing your joints or lungs any favours.
*   Air quality is sitting in the "moderate" zone thanks to ozone, which means some of you might be feeling it in your chest.
*   Widespread construction continues to mess with established routes, forcing detours onto potentially icy or uneven surfaces.

## Whitby Weather & Your Body

Alright, runners, let's talk brass tacks. It's -6.9°C and clear as a bell this morning. While the clear skies might *look* inviting, that temperature is no joke. Running in cold like this can be a real shock to your respiratory system, triggering asthma for some or just making every breath feel like tiny icicles are stabbing your lungs. Bundle up. Seriously. Layers are your friend, as are good gloves, a hat, and something to cover your face. Your extremities are going to be the first to suffer from frostnip or worse.

### Air Quality Check

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is currently at 72, which puts us squarely in the "moderate" category, with ozone as the primary culprit. For most of you, it's probably fine, but if you've got existing lung issues, or if you're pushing really hard, you might notice some irritation. Maybe dial back that tempo run a notch or two, or opt for an indoor session if you're feeling particularly sensitive.

### Whitby's Endless Construction Saga

Our fair town is basically one giant construction zone, and that means your usual routes are probably looking a little different, if they exist at all.

<AlertBox type="warning">
The **Columbus Road** widening project from Country Lane to Cedarbrook Trail is a multi-year beast, expected to continue until 2028. This means major disruptions for anyone trying to get around that area on foot or bike. Tree and brush clearing for this project is ongoing until April 1, 2026. On top of that, the **White Bridge Replacement** on Columbus Road at Lynde Creek is also chugging along until December 2026, aiming to add bike lanes and sidewalks, but currently creating more detours.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
If you're usually hitting the **Whitby Harbour Waterfront Trail**, be aware that a small section (less than half a kilometre) around Victoria Fields Park is closed for dredging until October 2026. There's a temporary asphalt detour, which is better than nothing, but keep your eyes peeled for uneven spots or residual ice, especially with these cold temperatures.
</AlertBox>

These detours aren't always perfectly maintained, so watch your footing. Ice patches are sneaky, and a twisted ankle on a poorly lit detour isn't how you want to start your day.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen is low. So at least that's one less thing trying to choke you out on your run.

<AlertBox type="danger">
With temperatures well below freezing, exposed skin can be at risk of frostbite in a short amount of time. Layer up, cover all skin, and listen to your body. Hypothermia is no joke.
