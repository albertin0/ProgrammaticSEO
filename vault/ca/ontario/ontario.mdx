Today? Not bad, but don't expect a personal best if you're sucking wind on the Pacific Electric Trail.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  - Air quality is *moderate* thanks to ozone. Your lungs will know it if you push too hard.
  - Low pollen means your allergies get a break, which is a win.
  - Chilly temps are great for running, but don't forget those layers, especially in the shade before the sun fully hits.
</BulletList>

## Today's Vibe: Chilly But Clear, Watch the Air

Look, it's 4°C out there, clear as a bell, and the pollen count is finally taking a chill pill. That's a triple threat for a decent winter run, right? Almost. The catch is the air quality, which is currently sitting at a 'moderate' 68 AQI, with ozone being the main party pooper.

What does that mean for your lungs? If you're hammering out intervals on the Pacific Electric Trail down by the old train depot, or doing some hill repeats near the San Antonio Heights, you might feel it a bit more than usual. This isn't "stay indoors and seal the windows" bad, but it's not "take a deep, cleansing breath" good either. If you have any kind of respiratory sensitivity, take it easy. Or, you know, just skip the speed work today. Your body will thank you later.

  **Pro Tip for Ozone Days:** Ozone levels typically peak in the afternoon. If you're going for a longer, harder effort, hit it early morning when the air is usually a bit cleaner.

### Pollen Report: A Rare Win for Your Sinuses

Finally, something good to report on the allergy front. Pollen levels are low. Like, really low. No need to look like you've been crying at a sad movie after a five-miler. Enjoy it, because we all know it won't last. Use this chance to tackle some of those trails you usually avoid when everything's blooming.

### The Cold Truth: Dress Smart

Four degrees Celsius is brisk. Perfect for getting your heart rate up without overheating, but you'll feel it if you stand around too long or don't layer properly. Think technical base layer, a light mid-layer, and maybe a windbreaker. Gloves and a hat aren't overkill for the first mile or two, especially if you're an early bird catching the sunrise near Cucamonga-Guasti Regional Park. Once you get moving, you'll warm up, but those initial minutes can be brutal.

## Local Hazards & The Usual Suspects

As of right now, there aren't any major breaking news alerts about wildfires, unexpected road closures, or rogue construction blocking major running paths around Ontario. That's a win in my book, considering how often things pop up around here. So, the usual rules apply: watch for uneven pavement on city sidewalks, keep an eye out for distracted drivers (they're always out there), and make sure you're visible if you're out before dawn or after dusk.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Watch for Slippery Spots:** Even with clear skies, shady patches on paths or bridges can hold onto moisture or develop black ice with these low temperatures. Step carefully, especially on the overpasses on the Pacific Electric Trail.
</AlertBox>

No major events blocking your usual routes today, so you've got the run of the place. Just be smart about that air and dress appropriately for the chill.
