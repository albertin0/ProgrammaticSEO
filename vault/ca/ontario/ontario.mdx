Today? It’s a chilly one, so bundle up, buttercup.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is decent, no big Red Alert days with the AQI at 69. Dominant pollutant is nitrogen dioxide, which is standard urban fare, not some wildfire nonsense.</li>
  <li>Pollen is low, so your nose won't be staging a rebellion, which is a rare win for February.</li>
  <li>It's clear and cold at -5.1°C. That means crisp air but also potential for ice on those less-travelled routes, especially after sunset or in shaded areas.</li>

## Workout Hazards & Tips for Ontario

Alright, Ontario, listen up. The good news is we're not dealing with any major environmental disasters today. No smoke alerts from wildfires, no "stay inside or sprout gills" flood warnings, and no extreme heat advisories that turn your afternoon run into a death march. It's just... winter. And winter always has its tricks.

### Watch Your Step (Literally)

While the weather's clear, that -5.1°C temperature is a stark reminder that anything wet from yesterday or earlier in the week is now probably a sheet of invisible danger. This isn't just about the main sidewalks; think about those less-trafficked paths along the Don Valley trails or even just cutting through a park. Shady spots near the Humber River will hold ice longer than anywhere else. Black ice is a sneaky beast, and it doesn't care about your PR.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Black Ice Advisory:** Even though it's clear, shaded areas, especially on less-gritted paths and trails (like parts of the Martin Goodman Trail near the lake), are prime spots for black ice. Assume any damp-looking pavement is slick. Don't be a hero; slow down and consider trail shoes with better grip.
</AlertBox>

There haven't been any major reports of high winds today that would make your run feel like you're fighting a small angry child, which is a blessing. Nor are there any widespread construction closures blocking major running routes in the GTA that popped up in the last 24 hours. So, your usual loops should be open, just potentially icy.

## The Air You Breathe

The AQI at 69 isn't perfect, but it's far from "don't go outside unless you want extra lungs" territory. Nitrogen dioxide is the dominant pollutant, likely from vehicle exhaust, which is typical for a busy urban centre like ours. For most healthy individuals, this isn't going to be a showstopper. If you have asthma or other respiratory issues, you might feel it a bit, especially during high-intensity efforts, but it's not a severe alert.

## Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Yeah, it's low. This isn't exactly groundbreaking news for late February in Ontario. Trees are still mostly dreaming of spring, so your allergies can take a break. Enjoy it, because in a few months, you'll be fighting off pine and ragweed like it's a full-contact sport.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Dress for Success (and Survival):** Layers are your friend. You'll warm up fast once you get moving, but that initial cold can be a shock. Don't forget gloves, a hat, and a neck gaiter. If you're out there pushing it, moisture-wicking layers are crucial to avoid getting chilled by sweat.
</AlertBox>

All in all, today's a decent day for an outdoor workout if you're prepared for the cold and mindful of potential ice. Stick to well-maintained routes if you're nervous, and maybe leave the speed work for the treadmill if your route isn't cleared.
