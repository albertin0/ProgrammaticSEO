Look, if you don't *have* to be out there today, don't. It's a bone-chilling February 26th in Guelph, and your lungs and joints are going to feel every single degree.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
*   **The Air Wants to Hurt You:** It's -9.4°C out there, clear skies, but feels more like -15°C. By tonight, we're talking wind chills hitting -27°C. That's not "brisk," that's "stay inside unless you enjoy pain and potential frostbite." Southwestern Public Health even issued a cold weather alert for overnight last night, and while temps are supposedly warming today, those wind chills are no joke.
*   **Moderate AQI with an Ozone Kick:** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 71, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While Environment Canada calls it "Low Risk" for most, cold, dry air combined with ozone is a recipe for unhappy lungs, especially if you're pushing it.
*   **Icy Surprises on the Paths:** With temperatures consistently below freezing, expect any moisture to be solid. Trails like the Speed River Trail or the paths in Riverside Park are likely to be packed snow or, worse, glare ice hiding under a dusting. Don't assume anything is clear, even if the pavement looks dry.

### Extreme Cold Hazard: Bundle Up or Bail
This isn't a day for pushing limits without proper gear. Wind chills today will make exposed skin prone to frostbite in minutes. We're talking multiple layers, windproof outer shells, insulated gloves, a good hat that covers your ears, and a scarf or balaclava to protect your face and lungs from that bitter air. Avoid strenuous exercise outside if you have any respiratory issues.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Air Quality & Respiratory Strain
Even with "Low" pollen, the combination of moderate AQI (71) and freezing air, with ozone as the dominant pollutant, means your lungs will work harder. If you're susceptible to respiratory issues, consider moving your workout indoors today. Sensitive groups may experience minor to moderate symptoms from long-term exposure.

### Trail Conditions and Ongoing Projects
Expect sections of our beloved trails, especially in shaded areas or along the Speed River, to be slippery. The Guelph Hiking Trail Club's own event descriptions for this time of year mention uneven terrain due to snow, ice, mud, and rocky sections. And speaking of trails, a reminder that the G2G Rail Trail still has that problematic gap requiring users to navigate a heavily-trafficked section of Silvercreek Parkway North. Funding news from earlier this week confirmed this is an ongoing safety concern, not a resolved one. If you're heading that way, be extra vigilant.

Seriously, folks. Winter running is tough enough without actively inviting frostbite or a pulmonary embolism. Stay warm, stay safe, and maybe hit the treadmill today.
