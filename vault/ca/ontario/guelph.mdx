Don't let that "clear" sky fool you; today's a classic late-February Guelph day where the weather can still deliver a sneaky gut punch if you're not prepared.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**Looks deceivingly mild, feels gnarly:** While the temperature hovers around 4.4°C, Environment Canada says it's dropping to minus 8°C this afternoon with a wind chill making it feel like **minus 14°C**. That's a quick trip to hypothermia if you're underdressed.</li>
  <li>**Watch your footing, seriously:** If you're hitting the trails, expect a mixed bag of snow, ice, and mud. We're still in that sloppy transition phase, and the Guelph Hiking Trail Club specifically noted "uneven terrain due to snow, ice, mud, and rocky sections" for a hike planned on the Arkell Spring Trails today. Don't be that person face-planting on a patch of black ice.</li>
  <li>**Air quality is 'meh,' but not terrible:** An AQI of 68 is moderate, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not ideal, but it's far from a red alert. If you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel it a bit, but for most, it's manageable.</li>
</BulletList>

## The Nitty-Gritty Details for Your Guelph Grind

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Low          | N/A           |

Alright, allergy sufferers, rejoice: pollen levels are low today. That's one less thing to make your post-run snot-rocket a full-on spectacle.

### Air Quality Report

Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 68, with ozone taking the lead as the primary irritant. For the majority of you out there, this won't be a huge deal. Your lungs can handle it. If you're usually bothered by moderate AQI, maybe stick to some tempo work instead of trying to PR a 10k on the Speed River Trail.

### Weather & Trail Conditions

Here’s where it gets real, folks. The initial glance at a "clear" day with 4.4°C is a trap. The temperature is going to tank to around minus 8°C by this afternoon, and with the west winds gusting, it'll feel closer to **minus 14°C** with the wind chill. Layer up, and then add another layer. Seriously.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **DANGER: Sudden Temperature Drop & Wind Chill!** The apparent mildness is temporary. Temperatures will plummet throughout the day, and significant wind chill will make it feel much colder. Hypothermia is no joke. Dress in layers, cover exposed skin, and don't underestimate the cold.
</AlertBox>

On the ground, expect the usual winter-spring melange. If you're heading out to the Arkell Spring Trails or similar unpaved routes, prepare for snow, ice, and mud underfoot. Your trusty road shoes aren't going to cut it; grab those trail runners with some grip, or better yet, throw on some icers. Don't want to explain a broken ankle to me at the clinic next week.

Good news for some trail users: the Guelph Junction Railway Multi-Use Trail, which runs from Woolwich Street to Woodlawn Road, officially opened as of January 2026. It's a sweet, paved stretch, but even there, watch for icy patches in shaded areas.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **TRAIL HAZARD: Icy & Muddy Conditions.** Expect slick spots, especially in shaded areas and on natural trails like the Arkell Spring Trails. Footing will be treacherous in many places. Wear appropriate footwear with good traction, like trail shoes or microspikes.
</AlertBox>

As for other local amenities, the Guelph/Eramosa Township sports fields are still closed for the season, so forget about trying to get some sprints in on the grass. And while there was some long-term construction on Wellington Road 11 involving a bridge replacement, that's further out in Mapleton and shouldn't impact city trails.

### Final Word

It’s a day for smart choices. If you're heading out, dress like you're going to Siberia, stay aware of your footing, and consider a route with good visibility and less varied terrain. Your body will thank you, and I won't have to deal with your frostbite or sprained ankle.
