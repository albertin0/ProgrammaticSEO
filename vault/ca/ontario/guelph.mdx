Don't even think about hitting those trails without some serious layers today, Guelph.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is *not* your PR day:

<BulletList>
  *   **It's a bitter cold one out there.** While the thermometer says -4.5°C, those wind chill values are biting, making it feel more like -8°C this afternoon, dropping to a brutal -19°C this morning. Your lungs will hate you if you don't cover them.
  *   **Moderate air quality with an ozone kicker.** An AQI of 73 might not scream "stay inside," but with ozone as the dominant pollutant, anyone with respiratory sensitivities should take it easy. Your lungs are already working overtime in this cold; don't make them fight bad air too.
  *   **Snow and ice are still playing games.** We've got flurries, possibly heavy, rolling in with local blowing snow. This means reduced visibility and potentially very slippery surfaces. Even clear spots can hide black ice, especially around the exposed sections of the Speed River Trail.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. We're runners. We're tough. But today isn't about proving how tough you are by suffering through a frosty, moderately polluted run with dodgy footing. Today is about being smart so you *can* run tomorrow.

That -4.5°C feels like a joke when the wind cuts through you, making muscles tight and joints stiff before you've even properly warmed up. Then you add in the moderate air quality from ozone? That's a recipe for a wheezy, uncomfortable effort, not a healthy one. If you've got any kind of lung irritation, asthma, or just generally enjoy breathing, seriously consider an indoor alternative.

The trails, like our beloved Speed River Trail, are likely a mix of packed snow, hidden ice, and fresh flurries, especially where they're less trafficked. The Guelph Off-Road Bicycling Association even advises caution for "iffy conditions" and warns against riding in "slushy" conditions that turn into frozen ruts. That goes double for runners. A twisted ankle on black ice isn't a badge of honour; it's a ticket to physical therapy (from me, probably, so I'd know).

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Wind Chill & Ice Hazard:** The "feels like" temperature is significantly colder than the actual temperature, increasing the risk of frostbite on exposed skin within minutes. Watch for hidden ice patches, especially on shaded paths and bridges.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Layer Up, Smartly:** Wear moisture-wicking base layers, an insulating middle layer, and a windproof/water-resistant outer shell. Don't forget insulated gloves, a hat that covers your ears, and a neck gaiter to pull over your mouth and nose to warm the air you breathe. Traction devices for your shoes are a good idea if you insist on hitting any slippery spots.
