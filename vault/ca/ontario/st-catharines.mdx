If you're eyeing an outdoor workout in St. Catharines today, February 26th, bundle up tight and keep an eye on your lungs.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Bone-Chilling Cold:** While the sun might be out, the temperature is hovering around freezing, and that wind chill will make it feel much colder. You're not invincible, so dress like it.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is pushing into the yellow, thanks to ozone. If your lungs usually complain, today might not be their favourite day for a hard push.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Our city loves a good construction project, and that means trail and road disruptions are pretty standard, even if they're not always advertised with a bullhorn.
</BulletList>

## The Rundown

Alright, St. Catharines, let's get real about stepping outside for a run or ride today. The environmental data says it's a "Clear" day with the temperature at -1.8°C, which sounds almost pleasant after the deep freezes we've had. But don't let that fool you. The "feels like" temperature is closer to -5°C to -6°C, and that's where the rubber meets the icy road, folks.

### Weather & Air Quality

Today's conditions are a mixed bag. The air itself has an AQI of 74, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. This isn't terrible, but it's not exactly crisp, clean air either. If you have asthma or other respiratory issues, you might feel this one more than others. Keep your intensity dialed back, especially if you're hitting those routes that put you closer to vehicle exhaust.

| Pollutant          | Level  |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| Ozone (Dominant)   | 74 AQI |
| Particulate Matter | Low    |

### Trail & Road Hazards

Let's talk about actually moving around out there. While the calendar says late February, winter isn't done with us yet. Expect potential icy patches on less-trafficked paths, especially in shaded areas or where meltwater might have refrozen overnight. The Bruce Trail, especially sections that get less sun, could be dicey.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** With temperatures consistently below freezing, any lingering moisture on sidewalks or unplowed trails can turn into black ice. Assume every shaded corner is a potential slip-and-slide.
</AlertBox>

Construction is another classic St. Catharines obstacle. You might recall the Glendale Avenue bridge recently had vehicle closures, and while that should be cleared up now, it's a reminder that our infrastructure is always getting *updated*.

More presently, if you plan on using the trails around **Burgoyne Woods Park**, be aware that park upgrades are underway, with construction tentatively scheduled to continue into June. While access to trails should remain open, expect some intermittent detours and heavy equipment in the area. It's not a full closure, but it means you need to stay vigilant and probably won't be setting any personal bests for uninterrupted flow.

Also, the Niagara Region is planning rehabilitation work on the Seventh Street Louth bridge, tentatively starting "in the coming weeks" and running until spring 2026. While not an immediate impact today, if you use that route, keep an eye out for initial disruptions or single-lane closures. Pedestrian access is promised, but "care is requested when walking through the construction zone," which is code for "don't expect a smooth ride."

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for Success (and Survival):** Layers are your friend. Think wicking base layer, insulating mid-layer, and a windproof outer layer. Don't forget insulated gloves, a hat that covers your ears, and good wool socks. Exposed skin is just asking for trouble in these "feels like" temperatures. Frostbite can set in fast.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Ozone Alert:** With an AQI of 74 due to ozone, sensitive groups (asthmatics, elderly, children) should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Your lungs will thank you.
