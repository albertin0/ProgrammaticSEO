Today? You *can* run, but it's going to hurt your face and your lungs if you're not smart about it.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Brutal Cold:** The actual temperature is sitting around -3.6°C, but with the wind, it *feels* more like -9°C to -10°C (14-15°F) out there. That's frostbite territory in minutes if you're not covered.
*   **Sketchy Footing:** We've had some fresh snow, about 0.79 inches expected today alone. City trails, like sections of the Merritt Trail, aren't exactly groomed for your morning tempo run in winter, so expect slick, icy patches hiding under that fresh powder. Remember that ice storm we dodged recently? The remnants are still lurking.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is clocking in at 73, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not awful, but for heavy cardio, it's not ideal either. Combine that with freezing air, and your lungs will be working overtime.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The sun *might* peek through the mostly cloudy skies, and the pollen count is mercifully low, so your nose won't be a snot factory. But seriously, this isn't the day for setting PBs or showing off your new minimalist running gear.

## Hazards You Can't Ignore

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Frostbite & Hypothermia Risk
AccuWeather is straight-up advising "Caution" for these conditions. We're talking frostbite to exposed skin within 8 minutes. Without proper gear, hypothermia is a real concern. If you're out there, cover *everything*. And I mean everything.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Icy Trails & Sidewalks
With temperatures consistently below freezing and new snowfall reported today, any untreated surface is a slip-and-slide waiting to happen. Be extra careful on bridges and shaded areas, especially on popular routes like the Merritt Trail that might not get immediate salt or plowing. Take shorter strides, keep your weight over your feet, and seriously, consider those micro-spikes if you're hitting anything off-road.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Downtown St. Paul Street Construction
If your route takes you through downtown, specifically St. Paul Street West, expect ongoing construction related to the GO Transit expansion. Businesses have been dealing with disruptions for months, and while it's more about traffic and access, pedestrians need to be hyper-aware of detours, uneven surfaces, and potential equipment. It's not a smooth sailing zone.

### Gear Up, Smart Runner
Layers are your best friend today. Think moisture-wicking base layers, an insulating middle layer, and a windproof/water-resistant outer shell. Don't forget insulated gloves or mitts, a warm hat that covers your ears, and a neck gaiter to pull over your face. Bright colours are a good idea too, because visibility might be reduced with any lingering flurries.
