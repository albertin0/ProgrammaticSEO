Alright, St. Catharines, if you're quick, today's your last hurrah before winter tries to claw its way back. Get out there, but don't say I didn't warn you about what's coming.

<BulletList>
*   Current clear skies and mild temperatures are a treat, but don't get complacent—arctic air and snow are on tonight's menu.
*   Air quality is sitting in the "moderate" zone thanks to ozone; if your lungs usually complain, pay attention.
*   Various construction projects are still making a mess of our pathways; know your route or risk a frustrating detour.

## Today's Rundown: A Brief Reprieve

At 6°C and clear, this morning feels like a gift from the weather gods. Don't fall for it completely. While pollen is mercifully low, giving your sinuses a break, our AQI is hovering at a moderate 67 due to ozone. For most of us, that's fine, but if you're prone to lung irritation, maybe dial back the intensity on your longer efforts. Nobody needs an asthma attack just because the sun popped out.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Ice, Ice, Maybe Baby?
That lovely clear weather? It's a cruel trick. Tonight, temperatures plummet to a frosty -7°C and periods of snow are expected to roll in. This means tomorrow morning's trails, especially shaded spots or any unmaintained paths, will likely be a slick, icy mess. Planning a long run or a speedy bike ride? Get it done *now* or resign yourself to a treadmill session. Don't be surprised if the Merritt Trail turns into a slip-n-slide by dawn.

## Trail Troubles: Still Under Construction

Remember that never-ending story of trail closures? Well, it continues. If you favor the south end of the city, particularly for a solid trail run, listen up: a section of **The Twelve Side Trail** between Glendale Avenue and Lockhart Drive is still closed for storm sewer repairs. This isn't a "maybe go around" situation; it's a full-on "find another route" closure impacting everything east of Twelve Creek. Don't be that person trying to hop barriers or creating new, unsanctioned detours that just chew up the natural areas. Respect the closure.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Construction Chaos Continues
Beyond The Twelve, don't forget Niagara Parks has ongoing maintenance along the broader Niagara River corridor. We're talking road closures for tree work (Portage Road near Niagara Falls started Feb 24 for a week, so expect heavy equipment) and even sections of the Niagara River Recreation Trail seeing disruptions. Always check local city and Niagara Parks notices before heading out, especially on your bike.

### Farmer's Market Fun (and Foot Traffic)
The St. Catharines Farmers Market is open today from 7 AM - 2 PM. If your workout takes you anywhere near downtown, expect increased foot traffic and potential minor delays. Not a "hazard" per se, but certainly a good way to test your agility dodging strollers and folks carrying fresh produce.
