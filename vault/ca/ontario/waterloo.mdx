It's one of those "get it done early" kind of days, because Mother Nature is about to pull a fast one on us by sundown.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Enjoy the clear skies and 4.3°C while it lasts; that's not staying.
*   Ozone is the dominant pollutant today, making the air a moderate hassle for your lungs.
*   Tonight, expect a quick dip into freezing temperatures, snow, and bone-chilling winds.
</BulletList>

You woke up to some pretty decent conditions, didn't you? A balmy 4.3°C and clear skies in Waterloo feel like a gift in late February. Get out there and enjoy it, especially if your lungs aren't overly sensitive. The pollen count is low, so no complaints there.

However, don't let that fool you into a false sense of security for your evening run or bike ride. Environment Canada is calling for snow to start early this evening, dropping about 2 cm on us. More importantly, the temperature is going to plummet to a brutal minus 14°C, with winds picking up to 20 km/h, gusting to 40 km/h, making it feel like minus 20°C overnight. That's a surefire way to invite frostbite and hypothermia, not to mention a slick, snowy mess on your usual routes.

### Winter's Back, Tonight.
The relatively mild, clear morning is a trap. If you're planning an outdoor workout after work, rethink it. Tonight brings 2 cm of snow, winds up to 40 km/h, and a wind chill of -20°C. That's dangerous cold, especially on exposed trails. Bundle up beyond belief or move it indoors.
</AlertBox>

Let's talk about the air. While not "dangerously" bad, our Air Quality Index is sitting at 69 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. For many, that's just a mild annoyance, but for anyone with respiratory issues, or if you're planning an intense, lung-busting workout, you might notice it. It's not a reason to stay home, but it's certainly not doing your aerobic capacity any favours.

As always, construction remains a perennial joy in our fine city. The Region of Waterloo is working on various infrastructure improvements, including watermain replacements on Columbia Street between King Street and Westmount Road. This might mean unexpected detours or uneven surfaces on sidewalks and multi-use paths around that area. While no specific trail *closures* were flagged as new in the last 24 hours directly impacting popular spots like the Laurel Trail, it's always wise to check the City of Waterloo's interactive map for current road, sidewalk, and trail closures before you head out. Just because a path isn't "closed" doesn't mean it's not a bumpy, messy construction zone.

### Lock Up Your Stuff, Even Indoors.
While not an outdoor hazard, the Waterloo Regional Police Service recently warned about a spate of thefts from lockers at fitness facilities. If you're hitting the gym instead of the trails today, ensure your valuables are secured with a good lock.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're itching to get your miles in, do it this morning. Hit the Iron Horse Trail, brave the construction near Columbia, just get it done before the sun starts to drop and Waterloo remembers it's still technically winter. Tonight's conditions are no joke, and frankly, not worth the bragging rights of running in a -20 wind chill. Your lungs and joints will thank you.
