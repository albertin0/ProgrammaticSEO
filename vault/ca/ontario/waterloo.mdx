If you're eyeing an outdoor run today, February 26th, in Waterloo, let's be real: it's not the worst, but it's definitely not a "strap on your shorts and fly" kind of day.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **It's Cold. Like, Properly Cold.** We're sitting at -8.7°C, which is brisk enough to make your snot freeze, and that's *before* any wind chill. Don't underestimate this.
*   **The Air Isn't Sparkling.** Our AQI is a moderate 72, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Not an emergency, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you'll feel it more with the cold, dry air.
*   **Snow and Ice are Your Frenemies.** We got a fresh dump of 5-10 cm of snow yesterday, and with these consistent sub-zero temps, it hasn't gone anywhere. Expect slick patches on everything from sidewalks to your favourite trail.
</BulletList>

### Today's Rundown

Look, I get it. You want to get out there. But unless you're built like a polar bear and have the balance of a tightrope walker, you need to dial back expectations. That fresh snow from yesterday might look pretty, but underneath it, or packed down on your usual routes, there's a good chance of black ice. Especially in shaded areas or on less-travelled paths. Forget trying for any PBs on the Iron Horse Trail today unless you enjoy eating pavement.

### Air Quality Check

The AQI sitting at 72 (Moderate) with Ozone as the main player means some of you might notice it more than others. Ozone can be a respiratory irritant, and when you combine that with freezing air, your lungs are working overtime. If you feel any chest tightness or unusual shortness of breath, it's not a sign of weakness to cut your workout short. It's a sign you're not an idiot.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Level | Dominant Types |
| :----------- | :------------- |
| Low          | N/A            |

Good news for your sinuses, at least. Pollen isn't going to be the thing taking you down today.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Ice, You Goof!
Recent snow and consistent cold mean icy patches are virtually guaranteed. Don't assume anything is clear. The Grand River Conservation Authority has previously warned about slippery conditions around waterways, and while an active flood warning isn't on for today, the general winter caution around slick banks and potential ice jams still applies. Stick to main, *cleared* paths if possible, and wear proper footwear with good grip. Traction aids aren't a sign of weakness, they're a sign of intelligence.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Dress for the Deep Freeze
It's -8.7°C, people. Exposed skin is going to get cold fast. Think layers, a good hat, gloves (maybe even mitts), and a wind-resistant outer shell. Hypothermia isn't just for Hollywood movies; it's a real risk when you're out for an extended period and not dressed appropriately. Your body has to work harder in this cold to regulate temperature, which can drain you faster.

<AlertBox type="info">
### Stay Hydrated (Yes, Even When It's Cold)
You still sweat in the cold, and the dry air can dehydrate you faster than you think. Don't skip the water just because you're not baking in the sun. Warm fluids pre- and post-workout can also help with core temperature.
