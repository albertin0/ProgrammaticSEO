It's a "bundle up and watch your step" kind of day in Mississauga, but frankly, the persistent construction and trail closures are a bigger headache than the chill.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
  *   **Chilly, Clear Conditions:** Temperatures around -2.6°C, but wind gusts up to 42 km/h make it feel like -8°C. Layer up, seriously.
  *   **Moderate Air Quality:** AQI 74, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. Sensitive lungs should take it easy.
  *   **Persistent Trail & Road Closures:** Multiple major routes are still impacted by ongoing construction and damage.

## Today's Outdoor Workout Rundown

Mississauga's weather today is typical February: clear but undeniably cold. While there's no new snow to contend with, extensive construction and trail closures are still significantly impacting outdoor activities, along with a moderate Air Quality Index.

### Air Quality & Pollen Report

| Pollutant | Level | AQI/Condition |
| :-------- | :---- | :------------ |
| Overall   | Low   | 74 (Moderate) |
| Ozone     | N/A   | Dominant      |
| Pollen    | Low   | N/A           |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Watch that Ozone!** An AQI of 74 with ozone as the dominant pollutant means sensitive groups – like runners with asthma or other respiratory issues – might experience discomfort. Keep an eye on your breathing and don't push it if you feel off.
</AlertBox>

### Construction & Trail Hazards

Now, for the stuff that actually ruins your rhythm. The **Hurontario LRT construction** remains a significant hurdle across the city. Expect detours, lane reductions, and general disruptions if your route crosses Hurontario Street anywhere from Port Credit up to Steeles, as rail work and intersection finishing continues. Don't expect this to clear up soon; completion is slated for 2028.

More critically for trail users, several key pathways are still completely or partially closed:

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Major Trail Closures Impacting Your Run:**
  *   A significant 330-metre section of the **Sawmill Valley Trail at Burnhamthorpe Road**, between Erin Mills Parkway and Sawmill Valley Drive, is *closed indefinitely* due to structural damage from past flooding. The river carved a new path here, so simple fixes aren't enough. There's a detour, but plan for a reroute.
  *   Portions of the **Etobicoke Creek Trail**, specifically from Cardiff Boulevard in Brampton down to Tomken Road in Mississauga, remain closed for sanitary sewer repair work. The duration of this closure is still unannounced, so your usual loop might be cut short.
  *   The bridge connecting the Riverside trail to the island in **Erindale Park** is also closed for repairs, with an estimated completion in May 2026. Another one to reroute around or avoid the area entirely if that bridge is part of your route.
  These aren't new issues, but they are very much still active hazards to be aware of.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Dress for the Chill:** With temperatures at -2.6°C and the wind making it feel more like -8°C, effective layering is crucial. A wind-resistant outer shell, moisture-wicking base layers, gloves, and a hat are non-negotiable for comfort and safety. Frostbite can set in faster than you think.
</AlertBox>

### My Two Cents:

Look, if you're dedicated, you can absolutely get out there. The cold isn't prohibitive, and the AQI is just moderate. But you'll be dodging ongoing LRT construction, and more frustratingly, running into some hard stops on our usually reliable trail system. Those Sawmill Valley, Etobicoke Creek, and Erindale Park closures aren't new, but they're still in effect and still messing with our mileage. Maybe today's a treadmill day, or a good opportunity to explore some less impacted side streets.
