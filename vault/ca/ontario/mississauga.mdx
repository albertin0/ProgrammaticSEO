Alright, Mississauga, let's talk about hitting the pavement today. It's a decent enough day to get out there, but don't let the "clear" skies fool you into thinking it's a walk in the park.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Those southwest winds are kicking up to 50 km/h gusts. That's enough to feel like you're running uphill both ways, and it'll make that 5.2°C feel significantly colder. Expect to be fighting it.
*   The Air Quality Index is hanging out at a moderate 70, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. If your lungs are sensitive, you'll definitely notice it. Take it easy and listen to your body.
*   Still dealing with some long-term trail headaches, so don't just assume your favourite path is clear.

## Today's Rundown: Wind, Ozone, and Lingering Trail Woes

You might look outside and see "Clear" conditions, which sounds glorious for February, but let's be real. It's a brisk 5.2°C out there, and with those southwest winds gusting up to 50 km/h, it’s going to feel more like 1°C. Layer up, folks. A windbreaker is non-negotiable unless you enjoy being sandblasted. Your core temperature will drop faster than usual, so keep that in mind if you're planning a longer run along the waterfront.

The good news? Pollen is low, so at least your nose won't be staging a rebellion.

| General Pollen     | Low    |

However, the Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 70, primarily due to Ozone. For most of us, this is an annoyance – maybe a slightly scratchy throat or a bit more huffing and puffing than usual. But if you've got asthma, COPD, or other respiratory issues, today is not the day to push for a PR. Consider taking your workout indoors or sticking to lower-intensity activities. Breathing in that ozone cocktail at full tilt isn't doing your lungs any favours.

### Watch Out for Those Gusts!
High winds increase the perceived cold and can make navigating exposed areas challenging. Be extra cautious if you're cycling or running near traffic, as gusts can throw you off balance. Don't be that person who ignores the wind and ends up regretting it.

On the trail front, some long-standing issues persist. Remember that structural damage on the **Sawmill Valley Trail at Burnhamthorpe Road**? Yeah, that section is still partially closed "until further notice". The river carved a new path there after some pretty gnarly flooding last year, and repairs aren't simple. Don't try to be a hero and bypass barricades – those closures are there for a reason, and nobody wants a twisted ankle (or worse) trying to prove a point. Same goes for parts of the Lisgar Meadowbrook Trail, which have seen temporary closures this winter due to sewer rehabilitation. Always check for local updates before heading out to your usual spots, especially near creek beds or flood-prone areas. Just because the sky is clear today doesn't mean the ground is perfectly intact from past events.

### Warm-up Like You Mean It
With the temperature hovering just above freezing and those strong winds, a thorough warm-up is crucial. Focus on dynamic stretches to get blood flowing to your muscles and joints before you hit your stride. Cold muscles are cranky muscles, and they'll let you know if you neglect them.
</AlertBox>

In short: It's not a terrible day, but it demands respect. Dress for the wind chill, be mindful of your breathing, and respect those trail closures. You'll thank me later when you're not battling a head cold or wading through a construction zone.
