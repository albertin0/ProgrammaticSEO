Alright, Mississauga, it’s February 26th, and if you’re thinking of lacing up those runners, you've got a mixed bag out there today. The air is crisp, but don't let the sunshine fool you; it's still winter, and those trails aren't magically clear.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Cold but Clear:** We're sitting at a chilly -5.4°C, but with that wind, it feels more like -11°C to -13°C. The good news is the skies are clear, and pollen levels are mercifully low.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at 72, which is moderate, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not terrible, but enough to notice if you're pushing hard.
*   **Icy Surprises:** While the city has been doing its best to clear up from that monster snow event in late January, expect lingering icy patches, especially on less-trafficked paths and shaded areas. That Port Credit Memorial Park skating trail might be closed, but ice isn't just for designated rinks.

## The Rundown for Your Run

Today is a classic late-winter Mississauga day: deceptively pretty, but ready to trip you up (literally) if you’re not paying attention. The low pollen count is a win for anyone with seasonal allergies, letting you breathe a little easier as you push through the cold air. But don't get complacent.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** Despite the clear skies, many paths, especially those less exposed to direct sunlight, will be slick. We're talking black ice, hidden under a dusting of snow, just waiting for your unsuspecting foot. This applies heavily to spots like the Credit Valley Trail, where shaded sections along the river can stay frozen solid for days. Slow down, shorten your stride, and consider traction aids.

### Air Quality Check

Here's the current breakdown:

| Pollutant          | Level  |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| Pollen             | Low    |
| AQI (Ozone)        | 72 (Moderate) |

An AQI of 72 is nothing to panic about, but if you're prone to respiratory issues, keep your intensity moderate, especially during peak traffic times when ground-level ozone might be higher. Remember, deep breathing cold, moderate-quality air can still irritate your lungs.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Buttercup!** This isn't the day for showing off your new spring shorts. Think layers – moisture-wicking base, insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and a neck gaiter or buff to cover exposed skin, especially with those wind chills. Frostbite can set in faster than you think.

### Trail Conditions & Closures

Mississauga has an extensive trail network, which is great, but it also means ongoing maintenance and, unfortunately, closures. Remember that a portion of the Sawmill Valley Trail at Burnhamthorpe Road is still partially closed due to structural damage from past flooding. The river decided to re-route itself, and city staff are still assessing options for repairs. There are detours, so plan your route ahead of time. Similarly, the Lisgar Meadowbrook Trail has seen its share of winter closures for infrastructure work, so don't be surprised by unexpected detours there either.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Don't Ignore "Trail Closed" Signs.** Seriously. Those signs aren't there for fun. Whether it's structural damage on Sawmill Valley Trail or ongoing construction for new active transportation bridges in Port Credit, a closed trail means danger. Find an alternate route. Your PR isn't worth a broken ankle or worse.

Stay safe out there, Mississauga. Enjoy the clear skies, but keep your wits about you.
