Look, if you're thinking about a leisurely jog outside today, think again.

## Why today isn't the day to push it, Brantford

<BulletList>
*   **It's brutally cold, and the wind ain't helping.** That -6.4°C might not sound deadly, but with the wind whipping off the Grand, it's feeling more like -11°C to -19°C. Grand Erie Public Health has a Cold Notification in effect, which means unprotected skin can freeze in under 30 minutes. Your lungs are going to hate that dry, frigid air, and your joints will be stiff before you even hit the corner of Colborne.
*   **Trails are a mess, and some are just plain GONE for now.** We've got major, *ongoing* construction closures on key sections like the S.C. Johnson Trail and the Dike Trail around Brant's Crossing Bridge, set to last until Fall 2026. Plus, the Grand River Conservation Authority is worried about ice jams and potential flooding, a real concern after a cold, snowy winter. Riverbanks are already slippery death traps. Seriously, avoid the river's edge.
*   **AQI is... fine, but don't let it fool you.** An AQI of 73 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant is moderate, not terrible, but breathing that cold, somewhat polluted air during exertion isn't doing your airways any favours. When everything else is screaming "stay inside," don't let a "moderate" AQI be your green light.

### Extreme Cold Alert is ON!
The City of Brantford and Grand Erie Public Health have issued a Cold Notification. Temperatures can cause frostbite on exposed skin in less than 30 minutes. If you absolutely *must* be outside, layer up like you're preparing for an Arctic expedition: hat, mittens, scarf, face mask – the whole nine yards.

### Ice Jams and Slippery Trails on the Grand River
The Grand River Conservation Authority (GRCA) just warned us yesterday, February 25, 2026, about significant ice in the Grand River and the high risk of ice jams, which can cause unpredictable and dangerous conditions. The banks are treacherous, and several local trails, including portions of the S.C. Johnson Trail and the Dike Trail, are closed for long-term construction or due to poor conditions. Seriously, do not mess with the river in these conditions.

### Indoor Options for Your Sanity (and Safety)
Consider the Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre or any of our other fine indoor facilities if you need to move. They’re heated, ice-free, and won't give you frostbite. If you still insist on outdoor activity, stick to cleared city sidewalks, dress appropriately, and keep it short. Your physical therapist (me) thanks you.
