If you're heading out for a run today, February 28, 2026, you're going to earn it, but maybe consider the treadmill.

## Why today is *mostly* not the day, unless you're built different

<BulletList>
*   **Wind Chill is a Real Kick in the Teeth:** While the air temperature is hovering around a balmy 2°C this morning, those breezy winds hitting up to 42 km/h will make it feel significantly colder. Expect it to drop further to -4°C by evening, feeling like a crisp -10°C with the wind chill. Your lungs might hate you, and any exposed skin will be regretting your life choices.
*   **Icy Patches and Lingering Snow:** Just because a freezing drizzle advisory from earlier in the week lifted doesn't mean the city magically cleared every patch of black ice. With temperatures still around freezing, especially in shaded areas or where snow has been slow to melt, you're looking at prime slip-and-fall territory. Remember the complaints about lingering snow on sidewalks from last month? This isn't that much better.
*   **Trail Blockages and Construction Headaches:** Forget a serene long run along the waterfront. The pedestrian access over the Rouge River along the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail is closed until 2027. Yes, *2027*. Also, if you were planning on exploring the East Don Trail, expect active construction and restricted areas until at least Spring 2026. Basically, half your favourite routes are either a full-on detour or a hard no.

## Environmental Breakdown

| Pollutant          | Level |
| :----------------- | :---- |
| Tree Pollen        | Low   |
| Grass Pollen       | Low   |
| Weed Pollen        | Low   |
| **Air Quality Index** | 68    |
| Dominant Pollutant | Ozone |

The good news is the pollen count is low, so your sinuses get a break. And an AQI of 68, with ozone as the dominant pollutant, is moderate. Not ideal if you're sensitive, but it's not actively trying to kill you like some summer days.

### Watch Your Step, Seriously
With the fluctuating temperatures and strong winds, previously melted snow and ice can refreeze quickly. Assume every shaded patch, especially on less-trafficked side streets or ungritted ravines, is a potential hazard. Sprains, strains, and fractures are no fun – trust me, I see enough of them in my day job.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail Closures: Know Before You Go
Seriously, don't just wing it, especially if your route involves the far east end of the city. The **Great Lakes Waterfront Trail closure at the Rouge River is a hard stop** with a long detour that's not exactly runner-friendly. You'll be adding significant (and unpleasant) mileage to your route if you don't plan around it. Similarly, the ongoing work on the East Don Trail means you'll hit barriers. Check city and TRCA websites before you head out, or better yet, stick to main roads and paved paths today.

### Dress for the Deceptively Cold Conditions
That 4°C "clear" weather report you might have seen is a lie. With gusts up to 42 km/h, it feels much colder. Layers are your friend, especially a windproof outer shell. Cover your ears, hands, and neck. By this evening, with snow expected and the wind chill hitting -10°C, you'll be seriously exposed without proper gear. Save the short sleeves for April.
