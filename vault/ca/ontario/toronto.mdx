Another chilly day in Toronto, but at least the air isn't trying to actively kill your lungs with wildfire smoke.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   It's cold enough to make your joints ache if you don't warm up properly, with wind chill still a factor this afternoon.
*   Air quality is sitting in the moderate risk zone, largely thanks to Nitrogen dioxide hanging around, so don't plan any personal bests if you're sensitive.
*   Ongoing construction means a few key trails are still messed up, forcing detours for your favourite routes.
</BulletList>

### Lungs (Air Quality & Pollen)

Alright, let's talk about what you're breathing. The AQI is currently at 68, with Nitrogen dioxide being the main culprit today. That puts us squarely in the "Moderate Risk" category for air quality. For most of us, this means "no need to modify your usual outdoor activities unless you experience symptoms such as coughing and throat irritation." Basically, if your chest feels tight or you're hacking up a lung on your usual pace, maybe dial it back or stick to an indoor track. Don't be a hero.

Pollen's still a non-issue, which is a small blessing in this perpetual winter.

| Pollen Level | Dominant Pollutant   | AQI |
| :----------- | :------------------- | :-- |
| Low          | Nitrogen dioxide     | 68  |

### Joints & General Safety (Weather, Trails, & Other Hazards)

It's clear to mostly cloudy out there, and the thermometer is hovering around -2.7°C, but with that lovely wind chill, it's still feeling like -7°C. The morning saw wind chills as low as -14°C, so if you were out early, hopefully, you layered up. Winds are light today, thankfully, up to about 15 km/h. This isn't "stay indoors" cold, but it's definitely "dress properly or regret it" cold.

Layer up, people. Think technical fabrics, not cotton. And for the love of all that is holy, cover your ears and hands. Frostbite can happen quicker than you think in these temperatures.

Now, about those trails. The **Lower Don Trail** south of Corktown Common is still messed up and closed due to the Port Lands construction. If you were planning a scenic run there, you'll need to use the detour along Mill Street, New Cherry Street, Commissioners Street, and Carlaw Avenue. And while the city *might* have cleaned up the bike lanes since the mid-February snowstorms, there's always a chance of lingering slush or ice in shaded areas, especially under bridges. Keep an eye on your footing.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Expect detours on parts of the Lower Don Trail due to ongoing Port Lands construction. Don't just blindly follow your usual route; pay attention to signage.
</AlertBox>

Finally, no major events are blocking routes, and thankfully, no wildfire smoke alerts today like we've seen in the past. So, if you're properly bundled and minding the moderate AQI, get out there, but keep your head on a swivel for those icy patches and construction zones.
