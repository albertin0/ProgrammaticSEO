Yeah, you *could* go for a run outside today, but only if you've got a thick skin, both literally and figuratively.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
  * That -7.3°C temperature? It's not just "crisp." With the wind chill we've been seeing, it's straight-up frostbite weather if you're not bundled correctly. Your lungs will hate you, and your joints will feel it.
  * Icy patches are still a real thing. The Chatham-Kent Police were warning about dangerous icy roads on Monday, specifically on stretches like Longwoods Road between Chatham and Bothwell. Assume anything not heavily salted is a skating rink waiting to happen.
  * Our municipal trails? Forget about it. They aren't maintained in the winter, so if you're hitting the path along the Thames River, you're doing it at your own risk. Expect hidden ice, uneven snow, and general shenanigans.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. We're runners. We like to pretend we're tough. But there's tough, and then there's just plain stupid. Today leans dangerously close to the latter for anything beyond a quick, well-layered dash on cleared pavement.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ### Extreme Cold & Ice Hazard
  Environment Canada has been hammering us with extreme cold warnings, citing wind chills that feel like -25°C to -30°C. That's enough to cause frostbite in minutes on exposed skin. If you *must* go out, layer up like you're planning an expedition to the North Pole. We're talking multiple layers, windproof outer shells, hat, gloves, and proper winter running shoes with some grip. Don't skimp, or you'll be regretting it in the physio office later. Also, with the recent freeze-thaw cycles, assume any shaded spot or unplowed path is an ice trap. The Lower Thames Valley Conservation Authority has even been watching for ice jams on the Thames River, which tells you what kind of cold we've been dealing with.
</AlertBox>

Your lungs are going to be working overtime trying to warm that cold air. If you've got any kind of respiratory issues, maybe give today a miss. And for the love of all that is holy, don't run with your mouth open like a gasping fish. Cover it with a balaclava or a scarf to pre-warm that air. Your bronchi will thank you.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### Watch for Unexpected Closures & Unsafe Surfaces
  While there haven't been *new* major trail-blocking events in the last 24 hours (beyond the usual winter disclaimers for trails), there are still some long-term road closures like portions of Talbot Trail due to erosion, or Town Line Road for bridge work. These might mean unexpected detours if you're on a long route. More importantly, remember that "clear" weather doesn't mean clear paths. That ice on Longwoods Road from earlier this week? It's not magically gone. Assume any path less traveled is a hazard.
</AlertBox>

  ### AQI is Moderate, But Cold Air is a Factor
  The Air Quality Index is sitting at 72 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. That's "moderate," not terrible. But combine moderate air quality with extremely cold, dry air, and it's a recipe for irritated airways. If you feel any chest tightness or shortness of breath beyond your usual "I hate hills" feeling, listen to your body and cut it short.

Here's the lowdown on the sniffles forecast:

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| General     | Low     |

No excuses on the pollen front today, folks. It's too cold for anything to be blooming anyway. Your biggest enemy out there is the cold, the wind, and potentially yourself if you're underdressed.
