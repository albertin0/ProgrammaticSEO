If you're looking to crush some miles today, Richmond Hill, you've got a decent window, but don't get complacent.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "Clear" weather report is a bit optimistic. Expect things to be chilly and potentially slick as the day progresses.
*   Ozone is hanging around at moderate levels, so if you've got sensitive lungs, consider dialling back the intensity.
*   Watch your step. With temperatures hovering around freezing and dropping significantly overnight, any moisture on the ground can turn treacherous.

## The Rundown: Don't Let Richmond Hill Trip You Up Today

Alright, runners, cyclists, and dog walkers, let's talk about hitting the pavement or trails in Richmond Hill today, February 28, 2026. My weather app says it's 3.9°C and clear, which sounds lovely, right? Wrong. The fine print (and Environment Canada, for those of us who actually live here) tells a slightly different story for the broader GTA. It's closer to 4°C, but *feels* like zero, and we're looking at cloudiness moving in with a 10% chance of snow during the day, jumping to a 60% chance tonight with temperatures plummeting to -11°C. So, that "clear" sky might just be a brief moment of false hope before the real Canadian winter decides to remind us who's boss.

### Air Quality: Not Quite Champagne & Sunshine

Your lungs won't be staging a full-on revolt, but they won't be sending thank-you notes either. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 76, with Ozone being the dominant jerk in the atmosphere. If you're someone who gets winded easily or has any respiratory issues, today might be the day to keep your long, hard efforts indoors. A casual stroll around Lake Wilcox is probably fine, but don't go trying to set any personal bests on the David Dunlap Observatory grounds if you're huffing and puffing more than usual.

### Ground Hazards: The Usual Suspects, Plus a Curveball

The ground temperature is going to be flirting with freezing all day, and with a chance of snow and dipping temperatures tonight, anything wet on the sidewalks or trails will become an ice rink faster than you can say "ACL tear." Don't even think about skipping your trail shoes with some grip if you're venturing off paved paths. I've seen enough winter wipeouts to last a lifetime, and trust me, your physio (me) would prefer not to see you.

The City of Richmond Hill is also currently budgeting for "resurfacing and reconstructing 27 kilometres of roads" and "upgrading 3.5 kilometres of watermains" in 2026. While no specific trail closures due to this work have been announced for today, it means construction is ongoing around the city. Keep your head up, not buried in your phone, especially if you're running along side streets or urban paths where projects might unexpectedly narrow pedestrian access or leave uneven surfaces.

Oh, and because this is Richmond Hill, apparently there's a "demonstration" scheduled for today at 1 p.m. The city's notice is pretty vague on the route, but if you're planning a lunchtime run near any major intersections or public spaces, keep an eye out. Getting caught in unexpected crowds is not exactly conducive to a good tempo run.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Tree        | Low     |
| Grass       | Low     |
| Weed        | Low     |

Low pollen levels are basically the only truly good news for outdoor activity today. At least your sinuses can breathe easy, even if the rest of you is struggling with the mild cold and potential ozone.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch for icy patches, especially in shaded areas or after dark.** The temperature dip tonight means whatever melts today will refreeze. Assume all wet surfaces are black ice in disguise.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
Dress in layers. Seriously. You'll start chilly, warm up, and then regret not having that extra windbreaker if you stop. And bright colours are always a good idea, especially with potential low visibility from clouds or flurries.
