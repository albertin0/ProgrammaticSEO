Today’s a classic Richmond Hill late-winter day, starting deceivingly clear but set to turn nasty, so get your outdoor miles in early, or better yet, stay inside.

<BulletList>
*   Temps are dipping fast from the current -3.6°C, and Environment Canada is calling for a low of minus 12°C with a wind chill around minus 15°C by evening. That's a real kick to the joints if you're not properly insulated and warmed up.
*   Your lungs are already doing a bit of extra work: the Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 75, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Couple that with cold air, and it's not ideal for deep breaths.
*   Local construction means you'll be dodging more than just icy patches. Expect ongoing roadwork and potential detours around areas like Arnold Crescent, where major reconstruction is still in full swing, adding uneven surfaces and traffic headaches to your route.

Look, I get it. The sun might be out right now and tempting you to hit the trails at David Dunlap Observatory Park, but don't let it fool you. We’re in late February in Richmond Hill, and Mother Nature rarely gives us a free pass this time of year. While pollen counts are thankfully low, that moderate AQI isn't doing your respiratory system any favours, especially with ozone hanging around. For anyone with even a hint of sensitivity, pushing hard today could leave you feeling more sluggish than usual.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step (and Your Neck):** While the provided data says "Clear" now, Environment Canada has issued a warning about an Alberta Clipper rolling through tonight, bringing flurries and making roads and walkways "difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow." If you're out past dusk, assume everything is a potential slip-and-fall waiting to happen. Your chiropractor and I already have enough on our plates.

Seriously, those single-digit negative temperatures, soon to plummet into the double digits with a biting wind chill, are no joke for your muscles and joints. Tendons get stiffer, muscles contract less efficiently, and your body burns more energy just trying to stay warm. If you're heading out for a run or a long walk, layer up intelligently, cover exposed skin, and make sure your warm-up is thorough enough to actually prepare your body for the cold. And don't even *think* about showing up underdressed; frostbite isn't a badge of honour, it's a medical emergency.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Hydration in the Cold:** Just because it's cold doesn't mean you're not sweating. Winter air is dry, and your body is working overtime to regulate temperature. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout. Dehydration is a stealthy enemy in any season.
</AlertBox>

Finally, that ongoing road reconstruction on Arnold Crescent, Highland Lane, and Elizabeth Street isn't just a nuisance for drivers. If your route takes you through these areas, be prepared for narrower pathways, uneven pavement, and reduced visibility due to construction equipment. Traffic diversions might also push you onto less-safe routes, so keep your head on a swivel. Don't assume drivers see you, especially with changing road layouts.
