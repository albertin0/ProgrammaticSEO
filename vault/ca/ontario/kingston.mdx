Alright Kingston, let's talk about hitting the pavement or trails today, February 28, 2026.

Today's a "could be worse, but watch your step" kind of day for an outdoor workout.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Mild Temperatures:** At 3°C and clear, it's actually pretty decent for late February, beating out most of the past week's chill.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is sitting at 67 with ozone as the dominant pollutant, which means sensitive folks might notice it. It's not ideal, but far from "stay inside."
*   **Persistent Obstacles:** Construction and ongoing events mean you'll be navigating detours and potential slick spots, especially downtown.
</BulletList>

### The Rundown: Don't Trip Over Progress

Look, the calendar says winter, but the thermometer's giving us a bit of a break at 3°C. That's a blessing, truly. The skies are clear, which usually means good visibility for your strides. However, don't let the sunshine fool you into thinking everything's smooth sailing. We had a decent snowfall a few days back on February 22nd, and while main roads are likely clear, those charming side streets and less-travelled pathways? Expect some lingering icy patches, especially in shaded areas or if you're out before the sun really gets to work. A twisted ankle is not the kind of personal record you're aiming for, so keep your eyes peeled.

### Air You Breathe

The air quality index is clocking in at 67, with ozone being the main culprit. This is in the "moderate" category, meaning most of us will be fine, but if you've got a history of respiratory issues, you might feel a bit of irritation. It's not a lung-buster, but also not the crisp, clean air we all dream of. Take it easy if you feel any discomfort.

### Navigating Kingston's Urban Maze

This is where things get a bit more... Kingstony. If your route takes you anywhere near the water or downtown, expect some rerouting. The **Downtown Waterfront Pathway** is still partially closed at 1102 King Street West due to construction and shoreline work. You'll have to use the sidewalk on King Street West there, which, let's be honest, isn't quite the same as a dedicated pathway.

Further downtown, if you're thinking of a sprint past **Springer Market Square**, be aware that Market Street, from King Street East to Ontario Street, is closed until March 6th for the "Spirit of Winter" event. While the event itself is wrapping up today at 7 PM, the closure for setup/takedown is still very much in effect. This means less space for your strides and more weaving through downtown traffic. Also, don't forget the general construction delays and lane shifts on King Street West for sanitary and water main work. It's all part of the city's "progress," but it means you need to be extra vigilant.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Watch out for the Waterfront Pathway Closure:** The Downtown Waterfront Pathway at 1102 King St. West is still closed for construction. You'll need to detour onto the King Street West sidewalk. This is a permanent feature until further notice, so plan accordingly.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Lingering Ice & Moderate AQI:** Despite clear skies, shaded areas, especially on lesser-used trails, could have slick patches from recent snow. Combine that with a moderate AQI (67), and those with sensitive lungs should consider an easier pace.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for the Thaw:** With temperatures above freezing, layers are your friend. You'll warm up fast, but the air still has a chill. Don't forget reflective gear if you're out early or late – shorter days still, people.
