Alright, Kingston, let's talk about hitting the pavement or trails today. My honest take? Today’s a solid "bundle up and get it done" kind of day, if you don't mind a bit of a nip in the air.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Clear skies, finally. After that last snowfall on the 22nd, it's nice to see some sun, but don't let it fool you. It's still a Kingston winter, and we're not exactly in Bermuda.
*   The temperature is hovering around -3.8°C right now, and while the high is projected to hit -2°C, that morning wind chill was a frosty -15°C. You'll feel it if you're not properly layered.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 72 AQI, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. It's not a red-alert situation, but for those with sensitive lungs, it's something to consider before you push for a new personal best on the K&P Trail.
</BulletList>

### Weather & Conditions

The sun's out, which is a mental boost, but the physical reality is still cold. The winds are manageable, mostly southwest at 20 km/h, but that morning wind chill wasn't playing around. Expect those low single-digit negatives to persist throughout the day, dropping to a brisk -10°C tonight.

**Watch Your Step: Icy Patches are STILL a Thing.**
Despite the clear skies, remember that significant snowfall from earlier in the week means residual ice is lurking, especially in shaded areas or on less-travelled paths. The city's snow-clearing efforts might have been slower than usual following that event, so assume untreated surfaces are slick. Be particularly mindful on sections of the Waterfront Pathway where drainage might lead to refreezing, or those less-maintained offshoots of the K&P. Don't be a hero; walk on ice.

### Air Quality & Pollen

Kingston's air quality is moderate today, clocking in at an AQI of 72. Ozone is the main culprit, which means you're breathing in a bit more than just crisp, cold air. If you're planning an intense session, especially down by the harbour where air can get stagnant, think about scaling back or choosing an indoor option. Your lungs will thank you.

Pollen levels remain low, which is typical for late February in this part of the world. So, at least your sinuses get a break, if not your toes.

### Trail Updates & Local Hazards

Good news, mostly: no major, widespread trail closures reported from recent events. However, the **Downtown Waterfront Pathway** is still a bit of a mess near 1102 King St. West due to ongoing construction and shoreline work. They suggest using the sidewalk on King Street West, which, let's be real, isn't exactly the scenic route you signed up for. If you're a creature of habit and that's your usual loop, adjust your expectations or reroute.

**Construction Zone Ahead: Waterfront Pathway.**
A section of the Downtown Waterfront Pathway near 1102 King St. West is temporarily closed for construction. Diversion signage should be in place, but essentially, you're hoofing it on the regular sidewalk for a bit. It's a minor inconvenience, but don't go full-send without checking your map or looking for alternative routes.

**General Winter Reminders:**
*   **Layer Up:** Seriously. Base layer, insulating layer, wind/water-resistant outer layer. Your extremities will thank you.
*   **Hydrate:** Even in the cold, you sweat. Don't forget your water bottle, though it might freeze if you're out there long enough. Consider an insulated bottle.
*   **Tell Someone:** If you're venturing out alone, especially onto less-frequented trails or for longer distances, let someone know your route and expected return time. It's just smart.

In short, it's a cold, clear day. Dress smart, watch for ice, and don't expect a pristine run if you're aiming for the waterfront. But hey, at least it's not snowing.
