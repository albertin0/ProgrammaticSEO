Don't bother trying to PR your way out of bed for a speed workout today. It's a "bundle up and barely move" kind of morning here in Kingston.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   That clear sky looks inviting, but don't let it fool you. It's properly cold out there, currently -6.1 degrees Celsius, which is going to hit your lungs and stiffen your joints if you're not careful.
*   The Air Quality Index is creeping into "Moderate" territory at 72, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. Your lungs are already working overtime in the cold, they don't need that added irritation.
*   While there are no active snow squall warnings for Kingston today, with temperatures like this after any recent moisture, you can bet your last energy gel that black ice is lurking on sidewalks and paths, especially in shaded spots along the Waterfront Pathway.

## Today's Vitals

## Your Body, Your Choices, My Advice

Look, I'm a PT, not your mom. I'm just here to tell you what the numbers mean for your precious meat suit. Today's combination of cold air and moderate ozone isn't ideal for deep breathing exercises or pushing for personal bests. Your bronchial tubes are already constricting from the cold, and then you're adding ozone to the mix? It's like asking for a chest cold.

### Don't Trust That Clear Sky
Just because it's sunny doesn't mean it's warm or safe. That -6.1°C might feel crisp, but it's cold enough to cause real problems. Layer up like you're heading to the Arctic, and remember that exposed skin, especially hands, ears, and nose, is highly susceptible to frostnip in these conditions. A good, moisture-wicking base layer is non-negotiable.

### Watch Your Step – Ice is the Enemy
With temperatures consistently below freezing, any melt and refreeze creates treacherous ice. Sidewalks, untreated sections of paths near Little Cataraqui Creek, and even your own driveway can be deceptive. A slip on ice can lead to anything from a sprained ankle to a fractured wrist, or worse, a head injury. Trust me, I've seen it all in the clinic. Assume every wet-looking patch is ice and test it gingerly, or better yet, stick to well-gritted routes.

### PSA: Measles is Circulating
This isn't strictly a weather hazard, but it's important if you're hitting up indoor facilities. Kingston Public Health issued a warning recently about possible measles exposure between February 9th and 13th at a few local spots, including the Goodlife gym on Barrack Street and Queen's University's Kingston Hall. If you were at any of those locations during the specified times, or if you just generally feel under the weather, stay home. Seriously. No one wants your germs, and you definitely don't want measles.

So, if you absolutely *must* get out there, keep it mellow. Stick to shorter routes, stay aware of your footing, and listen to your body. Or just hit the treadmill. Nobody's judging.
