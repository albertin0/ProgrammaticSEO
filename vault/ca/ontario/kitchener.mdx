Alright, Kitchener, if you’re heading out for a run today, it's a "proceed with caution, but enjoy the fresh air" kind of day.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is sitting at a moderate 69 AQI, with Ozone being the dominant pollutant. Not great, not terrible, but if you’re prone to lung irritation, you might feel it.
*   We've had some recent freeze-thaw cycles, so expect some sneaky ice patches, especially on shaded trails and bridges. Don't be that person wiping out on the Iron Horse Trail.
*   Construction around the city is a constant, so keep an eye out for detours or pedestrian path changes even if nothing major is "closed" today.
</BulletList>

Look, the sun is out, the temperature is just above freezing at 4.3°C, so the desire to get outside is strong. And honestly, it beats being stuck indoors. But let’s be real, February in Kitchener means you can’t fully trust the ground beneath your feet.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch for Ice, Especially Near Water
The Grand River Conservation Authority had flood outlooks in place recently due to melting snow and increased river flows. While those specific warnings might have officially passed, the underlying conditions for slippery banks and potential ice jams near waterways like the Grand River or Laurel Creek still exist. Assume any unpaved or shaded section of path, particularly those close to water, could be a black ice trap. Slow your roll, scan ahead, and maybe consider a trail with better sun exposure.
</AlertBox>

Your lungs are probably more used to clear, crisp air, so an AQI of 69 with Ozone as the main culprit isn't ideal for smashing PRs. It’s not "stay indoors and panic" levels, but if you're asthmatic or have other respiratory issues, you'll probably notice it. Maybe dial back the intensity a notch, especially during peak afternoon hours when ozone levels can sometimes climb higher.

### AQI Breakdown
While pollen is low, the moderate AQI is something to consider. Listen to your body and adjust your pace or route as needed. It's not the end of the world, but it's not a perfectly clean slate either.
</AlertBox>

Regarding trail conditions, the City of Kitchener recently cancelled a snow event and parking ban, which means they've been busy clearing roads. This is good news for accessibility, but doesn't guarantee pristine trails. The ongoing talk of a citywide active transportation network, including upgrades to sections of the Dom Cardillo Trail and Spurline Trail crossings, tells me there's always some work happening. You might encounter temporary reroutes or equipment, even if no major trail *closures* are screaming in the news today. For instance, the Fischer-Hallman Road expansion project, which includes new multi-use paths, is gearing up for spring construction.

So, lace up, but keep your head on a swivel.

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |

| Low          | N/A           |

### Check City Resources for Localized Construction
The City of Kitchener has ongoing construction on various roads, some with lane reductions or work off-road that could affect pedestrian flow. Always check the City's website if you plan on running a route that involves significant road crossings or construction zones. Better safe than having to jump a barrier mid-stride.
