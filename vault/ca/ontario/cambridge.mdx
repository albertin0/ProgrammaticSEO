Today's a mixed bag, folks. Enjoy the clear skies while they last, but if your usual running spot is a trail, double-check before you head out.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air's Good, Pollen's Low:** No excuses on the air quality front. AQI is a decent 70 with ozone as the dominant pollutant, which is perfectly runnable, and pollen is practically non-existent. Breathe deep, Cambridge.
*   **Winter's Last Gasp (Maybe):** While it's a relatively balmy 5.3°C and clear right now, don't get too comfortable. Environment Canada is calling for snow flurries tonight and a brutal wind chill dipping to minus 20 overnight. If you're planning an evening or early morning long run, layer up like you're heading to the Arctic. We're still in that confusing "is it winter, is it spring?" phase.
*   **Trail Closures are a Pain:** This is the big one for our local runners and hikers. The Grand River Conservation Authority has several spots shut down. If Shade's Mills Conservation Area's Hardwood Trail is part of your usual loop, it's currently closed for maintenance. Same goes for Chesney Wilderness Area due to plantation thinning, and Puslinch Lake is seeing heavy machinery for conifer thinning, so stay clear of that area entirely. Ignoring these closures isn't just rude, it's potentially dangerous.

### Stay Aware of Trail Closures

Seriously, people, the GRCA isn't closing trails for fun. When you see those signs at Shade's Mills, it means they're doing work that could make the path unsafe, or there's heavy equipment around. Getting caught up in plantation thinning operations at Puslinch Lake is not how you want to end your run, trust me. Planning ahead and checking for alerts is just part of being a responsible outdoor enthusiast in Cambridge.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Impending Cold Snap:** While pleasant now, temperatures will plummet tonight. Dress for extreme cold and wind chill if you're out after dark or early tomorrow. Don't underestimate a -20 wind chill.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Check GRCA Alerts:** Always hit up the Grand River Conservation Authority's service disruptions page before you head to any of their properties. Things change fast, especially this time of year with maintenance and thinning operations.
