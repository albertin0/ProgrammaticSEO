Don't bother trying to set any personal bests out there today, folks. It's cold, potentially slick, and honestly, your lungs probably won't thank you for the effort.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Arctic Air & Wind Chill:** That "clear" sky is deceptive. We're sitting at -3.9°C, but with a wind chill around -16°C. Your exposed skin will be hating life, and your lungs will feel it, especially if you're pushing the pace. That kind of chill can hit your airways harder than usual.
*   **Lingering Snow & Ice:** Remember that "snow event" declared earlier this week? Well, the two to five centimetres we got are still hanging around. While main roads are likely clear, residential streets, shaded paths, and especially unplowed trails will have compacted snow and ice. Environment Canada even warned of slippery roads and reduced visibility just yesterday from heavy flurries and blowing snow. One wrong step on the Cambridge to Paris Rail Trail could land you on your backside, or worse, with a twisted ankle.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is clocking in at 75 due to ozone. It's not apocalyptic, but it's not exactly fresh mountain air either. Combine that with the cold, and sensitive lungs might feel the burn more than usual.

## Local Hazard Breakdown

<AlertBox type="danger">
### **Black Ice & Snowpack is Your Enemy**
Seriously, watch your footing. Just because the sun's out doesn't mean the ice disappeared. Expect sneaky patches, especially where snow has melted and refrozen, or where plows haven't reached. This is prime ankle-sprain territory. Be extra cautious on trails and side streets; city plows prioritize main arteries, leaving the rest to turn into a frozen obstacle course.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### **Black Bridge Road Construction Still Rolling**
If you were planning a scenic long run around Black Bridge Road, remember that major construction is still underway. While Stage 2 closures (which mean actual road blocks) are anticipated for "Spring 2026," which is practically now, it’s always best to assume there might be equipment, detours, or general mess. Keep an eye on local city updates if this is part of your regular route. It's not a direct *hazard* to you personally today if Stage 2 hasn't officially begun, but it's certainly a disruption you should be aware of.

<AlertBox type="info">
### **Dress Like an Onion, Not a Sausage**
Layers are your friend. Think wicking base layers, an insulating mid-layer, and a wind/water-resistant outer shell. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and a neck gaiter. If you're going out, cover up to protect from that biting wind chill and the general chill that will leach your body heat faster than you can say "hypothermia."
