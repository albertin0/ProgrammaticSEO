If you're eyeing an outdoor workout in Thunder Bay today, you're going to need more grit than usual.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
  *   Our city's still buried under an abnormal amount of snow this month, meaning your favourite local trails and residential sidewalks are probably in rough shape.
  *   That clear sky is a bit of a tease; the air quality is moderate, with ozone being the main concern, which can be tough on the lungs during exertion.
  *   Today brings more light snow, and tomorrow is set to be a windy, messy warm-up, so current conditions are just a preview of the sloppy situation to come.

### Weather & Air Quality Breakdown

| Metric          | Value                                                         | Notes                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Temperature     | -6.4°C (feels like -9°C this afternoon)             | Standard Thunder Bay winter chill. Dress warmly, but don't expect it to feel "mild."                                                                                           |
| Condition       | Clear, with periods of light snow expected (~2 cm) | It's not a blizzard, but any new snow on top of what's already here just means more uneven, potentially icy surfaces.                                                          |
| AQI             | 73 (Moderate)                                                 | Ozone is our dominant pollutant. If you've got respiratory issues, or even if you don't, scale back the intensity.                                                               |
| Pollen          | Low                                                           | At least your eyes won't be watering from seasonal allergies. Probably from the cold, wind, or the sheer effort of slogging through snow.                                      |

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Mind the minefield underfoot.** Thunder Bay has seen nearly 60 cm of snow this February, almost double the monthly average. City crews are still playing catch-up on residential streets and sidewalks from previous storms, so don't expect pristine conditions. Even well-trodden paths around **Trowbridge Forest** could be uneven and slick. High snowbanks around intersections can also seriously limit visibility for both you and drivers.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Friday Forecast: Windy & Icy Mess.** While today is merely annoying, tomorrow is shaping up to be truly treacherous for outdoor workouts. We're looking at a jump to +3°C, but with west winds screaming up to 70 km/h, and a delightful mix of flurries and rain showers. That means blowing snow and a significant risk of black ice forming as things thaw and refreeze. Planning a long run or ride? Seriously consider moving it to Saturday, even if it's colder. Trying to navigate the temporary bus stops and active construction zones near the **Waterfront Transit Terminal on Cumberland Street** will be extra hazardous with those winds.

  **Winter Running 101: Gear Up Smart.** If you insist on hitting the pavement or what passes for it today, proper footwear with good traction is non-negotiable. Layers are your best friend, and seriously, consider reflective gear if you're out anywhere near traffic, given how much the snow reduces visibility for drivers. Check those local trail reports for places like Kamview Nordic Centre before you head out, because conditions can change fast.

You want to run? Go run. Just don't come crying to me when you've sprained an ankle on a hidden patch of ice or inhaled too much ozone. You were warned.
