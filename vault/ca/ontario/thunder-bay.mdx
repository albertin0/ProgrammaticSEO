You want to run outside in Thunder Bay today? Are you absolutely out of your mind? This isn't a "tough it out" day; this is a "stay inside unless absolutely necessary and definitely bundle up" day.

<LungsJointsScore score={2} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The mercury is barely registering above "ice age" levels, with real-feel temperatures that will quite literally numb your face and lungs.</li>
  <li>Recent heavy snowfall means trails are likely still a mess of deep snow and hidden ice, not exactly ideal for maintaining any kind of stride.</li>
  <li>While pollen is low (finally, some good news for someone!), the air quality isn't doing you any favours either, especially when combined with this brutal cold.</li>

## The Deep Freeze is Real, Thunder Bay

Look, I get it. We're Northern Ontarians. We laugh in the face of a little snow. But today, February 26th, 2026, the joke's on anyone thinking a casual jog is a good idea. The actual temperature is -17.4°C, but with the wind chill, we're talking about conditions that *feel* more like -21°C this morning. That's not just "chilly," that's "frostbite in minutes" territory if you're not absolutely dialed in on your gear.

### Why Your Lungs Will Hate You

Breathing in air that cold, especially during strenuous activity, is a quick way to irritate your airways and potentially trigger exercise-induced bronchospasm. Add in an AQI of 79 with ozone as the dominant pollutant, and you're essentially asking for a chest cold before you've even hit your first kilometre. It's not worth the heroics.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ### Extreme Cold Warning: Frostbite Risk is High
  Temperatures are dangerously low. Exposed skin can develop frostbite in a matter of minutes. Limit time outdoors and ensure all skin is covered. This isn't a drill; your fingers and toes will thank you.

## Trail Conditions: A Snowy, Icy Mess

Remember that snowfall earlier this week? The one that dumped 15-25 centimetres on us? Yeah, city crews are still digging out. As of yesterday, they were still working on residential sidewalks and it's going to take "several days" to get to the *trails*. So, if you were planning on hitting up your favourite loop in Trowbridge Forest, expect to be post-holing through deep snow or slipping on treacherous, unseen ice under a thin layer of fresh powder. The Thunder Bay Hiking Association even cancelled a snowshoe event just yesterday due to the weather, which tells you everything you need to know about the state of our outdoor paths.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### Treacherous Trail Conditions
  Recent heavy snowfall means trails and untreated paths are likely deep, uneven, and potentially very icy. Risk of slips, trips, and falls is elevated. Stick to cleared and well-gritted paths, or better yet, move your workout indoors.

## Indoor Alternatives & Smart Choices

Unless you're planning an expedition to the Arctic and have the gear to match, today is a prime candidate for an indoor workout. Hit the gym, use your treadmill, do some bodyweight exercises. Your cardiovascular system and joints will be much happier. If you absolutely *must* go outside, think short, low-intensity, and layered like an onion. Cover your mouth and nose with a buff or scarf to warm the air you breathe.

  ### Gear Up or Stay In
  If you insist on outdoor activity, wear multiple layers, including a windproof outer shell. Don't forget insulated gloves or mitts, a warm hat, and a face covering. Traction devices for your footwear (like Yaktrax) are a smart move for any icy patches you might encounter.
