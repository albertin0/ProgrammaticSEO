Look, if you think today's a good day for an easy outdoor workout, you probably haven't been outside yet.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
*   **Arctic Blast, No Joke:** We're talking seriously dangerous cold. The thermometer says -17.6°C, but that wind chill is going to make it feel like your lungs are freezing with every breath. Frostbite is a real, immediate threat.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** While pollen is thankfully low, our AQI is sitting at 72 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not terrible on its own, but combined with the extreme cold, your respiratory system is going to be working overtime.
*   **Event Alert: Boulevard Lake:** If you're planning on hitting up Boulevard Lake for a run, be aware the Thunder Bay Metre Eaters are hosting their "Run for the Meatball" 5K this morning. Expect some crowds and potential course disruptions between 10:15 a.m. and 12:15 p.m.

## Today's Vitals: Don't Be a Hero

Seriously, Thunder Bay, it's brutal out there. Yesterday saw wind gusts up to 80 km/h, making conditions feel like -30°C overnight, and today isn't much better with wind chills around -29°C this morning. Environment Canada has been throwing out yellow-level cold warnings for the region, and it's not for fun. Exposed skin can develop frostbite in minutes. Minutes, people! Think about that before you decide to "push through."

I get it, you've got your training plan, you're dedicated. But dedication doesn't pay the physical therapy bills when you get frostnip or worse. The trails around here are likely still hard-packed and icy from the recent snow and freeze-thaw cycles, especially in shaded areas. The Thunder Bay Trails Association even warned about ice under the snow on some pathways like Norway Ridge earlier this year. You add a bit of residual blowing snow to that, and you're asking for a slip-and-slide straight to the emergency room.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

### Ozone Alert

That moderate AQI is primarily due to ozone. Ozone is an irritant, and when it's cold, your airways naturally constrict a bit more. Adding ozone to that mix is like asking your lungs to do extra reps while holding their breath. Not smart. Stick to indoor cardio if you really need to get your sweat on.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Cold and Wind Chill Warning:** The actual temperature is -17.6°C, but with the wind, it feels much colder. Frostbite is a significant risk today. Limit outdoor exposure to short bursts, if at all. Layer up like you're preparing for an arctic expedition, and for the love of all that is holy, cover all exposed skin. Fingers, toes, ears, nose – they're all prime targets.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail Conditions:** Recent heavy snowfall and subsequent freezing means many local trails, including those around Boulevard Lake, will be slippery with packed snow and ice. Uneven surfaces and hidden ice patches are a given. Use extreme caution if you absolutely must be outside, and reconsider anything technical.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Indoor Options Exist:** Your local gym probably has a treadmill that isn't trying to give you hypothermia. Or, hey, hit up the Thunder Bay Community Auditorium for some events later, but leave the outdoor running shoes at home. Seriously, today is a prime candidate for a rest day or indoor cross-training. Your body will thank you, and so will I, because I'd rather not see you in my clinic for frostbite treatment.
