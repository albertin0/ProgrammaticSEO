It's a "take it easy, London" kind of day. Don't expect perfect, but don't stay glued to the couch either.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
-   **Air Quality is Moderate:** Your lungs might notice the ozone kicking around, especially if you're pushing hard. Today isn't the day to try for a PR if you're sensitive.
-   **Wet Morning Trails:** If you're out early, expect some slick spots. The forecast called for morning rain, so paths will be damp and maybe a little greasy, but it's clearing up as the day goes on.
-   **Construction Zone Blues:** Ongoing roadwork, like around Clark's Bridge, means you'll hit detours and narrower paths if your route takes you near major thoroughfares. Plan accordingly.

## The Rundown

Alright, London, if you're heading out for a run or walk today, February 28, 2026, you've got a bit of a mixed bag. The good news is the pollen count is a non-issue. The bad news? Your lungs might still feel a bit of a workout thanks to the air quality.

### Air Quality & Your Lungs

The AQI is sitting at 71, putting us squarely in the "Moderate" category, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. For most of us, this is just a minor annoyance, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or just particularly sensitive airways, consider dialing back the intensity or sticking to indoor workouts. This isn't wildfire smoke levels from last summer, but it's not pristine either.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert:** If you're highly sensitive to air pollution or plan on a high-intensity session, keep an eye on how you feel. Moderate AQI with ozone can be irritating.
</AlertBox>

### Weather & Footing

The temperature is a reasonable 5°C, and while the early morning brought some rain, conditions are expected to improve to a "mainly dry afternoon with intervals of sunshine" and temperatures climbing to about 10°C. So, if you hit the trails like those along the Thames Valley Parkway, expect some dampness and potentially slippery sections, especially on less-maintained paths. Those wind gusts could hit up to 32 mph (around 51 km/h), so if you're out on an exposed section, you'll feel it.

### Local Hazards & Annoyances

<AlertBox type="info">
**Gibbons Park Washroom Closure:** Heads up, folks! The washroom facility at Gibbons Park is temporarily closed for repairs. Plan your hydration and pit stops accordingly.
</AlertBox>

Storybook Gardens is running its "Winter Magic" event today, so the skate trail is open with specific hours. If you're thinking of lacing up skates, check their site for current ice conditions and capacity. It's a fun spot, but not for a speed work session on your feet.

As always, construction is a thing in London. There's ongoing work across the city, including significant projects on major roads like Highbury Avenue and Wellington Road. While these don't necessarily block *trails*, they can impact access to parks or create extra traffic if you're getting there by car. Stay alert near active construction zones.

### Final Word

Don't let a little ozone or dampness completely sideline you. Just be smart about it. Dress for potentially wet conditions, listen to your body regarding the air quality, and remember that sometimes the best part of a long run is finding a new detour when your usual path is blocked. Get out there, but keep your wits about you.
