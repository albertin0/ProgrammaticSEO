Alright, Londoners, time to peel yourselves out of bed and face the cold. Today isn't the absolute worst, but it's far from perfect.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Clear Skies, Cold Air:** We've shaken off the snow squalls for a bit, but that -7.2&deg;C is no joke. The wind will bite, making it feel colder than the thermometer says. Yesterday saw wind chills down to minus 15, so don't expect a tropical breeze.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is clocking in at 73 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While Environment Canada was calling yesterday's air "Low Risk" and "ideal for outdoor activities," if you're sensitive, you might notice the ozone. Most of us will be fine, though.
*   **Icy Surprises:** Remember that "major thaw" we had a little while back? Followed by freezing temperatures? Yeah, that means black ice is probably lurking in those shady spots and on less-traveled paths. Especially watch your step on the sidewalks around Old South.

## The Rundown

The good news? Pollen is practically non-existent right now, so your sinuses can relax.
The bad news? It's February in London, Ontario. "Clear" just means you can *see* the cold.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Ragweed     | Low   |
| **Overall** | **Low** |

### Watch Your Step (and Your Lungs)

That clear sky might trick you into thinking it's a pleasant winter run, but your lungs will quickly remind you of the temperature. Layer up, and I mean *really* layer up. Think wicking base layers, a good insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget proper headwear, gloves, and thick socks. Frostbite can set in fast when it's this cold, especially with any lingering wind chill.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Beware of Ice:** Even with sunny conditions, shaded areas, bridge decks (like the ones along the Thames River Parkway), and untreated sidewalks are prime spots for black ice. Assume every wet-looking patch is ice and test it gingerly. A fall on ice is a fast track to a sprain or worse.

**Local Tip: Gibbons Park Washrooms Closed** If your usual pre-run pit stop is the washroom facility at Gibbons Park, you're out of luck. It's temporarily closed for repairs. Plan accordingly or find an alternative before you hit the trails.

### Construction Zone Headaches

Construction season never truly ends, it just hibernates. While major road closures for the spring are still being detailed, ongoing projects like the Highbury Bridge widening and work along Oxford Street are still happening. This means reduced lanes and potential detours, even if much of the work is underground right now. Keep your eyes peeled for construction vehicles and uneven surfaces if your route takes you near these areas. You definitely don't want to sprain an ankle on a hidden divot in sub-zero temps.

### Final Thoughts

Look, the air quality isn't screaming "stay inside" and there's no wildfire smoke, which is a win. But don't let the "clear" skies fool you into thinking it's balmy. This is London winter running: invigorating if you're prepared, miserable if you're not. Dress for much colder than it feels, stay hydrated, and for the love of your knees, watch out for ice.
