Alright, London. Today's not exactly a warm hug, but if you're stubborn, you can still get out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Bone-chilling wind chill this morning**, with it feeling closer to -20°C. Even with the afternoon high of -1°C, expect a biting wind chill around -6°C. Bundle up or wait for Friday when it's supposed to feel like spring.
*   **Watch your step**: While not a massive snowfall, yesterday saw some flurries, and London could have picked up a couple of centimeters. With temperatures staying below freezing, those patches are going to be slick. Expect icy conditions, especially on shaded or unplowed paths like sections of the Thames Valley Trail near Gibbons Park.
*   Air quality is moderate at an AQI of 75, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. However, Environment Canada has issued a "low risk" forecast for London's Air Quality Health Index today, stating "ideal air quality for outdoor activities" for the general population. Make of that what you will.

</BulletList>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Beware of black ice and hidden snowdrifts.** Any moisture from yesterday's light snow will be frozen solid. Assume every untreated surface is a slip hazard, especially on trails and sidewalks. Take smaller strides and consider traction aids for your shoes.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Cold Exposure:** With wind chills dipping close to -20°C this morning, exposed skin can suffer frostbite quickly. Dress in layers, cover all skin (gloves, hat, scarf), and don't push it if you feel numbness or tingling. This isn't a day for short sleeves and showing off.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Gibbons Park Washrooms are Closed:** If your route usually takes you through Gibbons Park, plan ahead. The washroom facility there is temporarily out of commission for repairs. Don't get caught needing to go in the cold.
