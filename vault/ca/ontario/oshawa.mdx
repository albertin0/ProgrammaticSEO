Today? Meh. It's a "get it done" kind of day, not a "set a new PR" day.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Pollen count is finally behaving, so your allergies won't be staging a hostile takeover mid-run.
*   The air quality, thanks to a healthy dose of ozone, is leaning towards "meh," especially if your lungs are a bit delicate.
*   Construction is still playing whack-a-mole with our routes, so don't expect a smooth, uninterrupted cruise.

## The Rundown: Oshawa Workout Conditions for February 28, 2026

Alright, Oshawa, let's talk turkey about lacing up your shoes today. The good news: you won't be running through a cloud of pollen, which is a small victory for those of us who usually finish a long run looking like we've cried through a hay fever attack.

However, the air quality index is clocking in at 75, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. That's "Moderate," folks. If you've got asthma, COPD, or just a general aversion to feeling like you're sucking on tailpipe emissions, maybe ease up a bit. It’s not a full-blown stay-indoors emergency, but it's not exactly mountain air either.

The mercury is sitting at a chilly 3.5°C. "Clear" skies mean you'll see the sun, which is a nice mental boost, but don't let it fool you into thinking it's warm. Layer up, for crying out loud. No one wants to deal with hypothermia when they're only halfway through their loop around Lakeview Park.

### Navigating the Urban Obstacle Course

Now, let's talk about the real joy killer: construction. Oshawa's currently undergoing a metamorphosis, which is great for future infrastructure, terrible for your current workout flow.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Major Road Closure: Simcoe Street South**
Remember that two-year nightmare? Simcoe Street South between Avenue and Albany streets is still shut down for GO Transit expansion. This isn't just a minor detour; it's a significant disruption if you rely on that corridor to connect from Lake Ontario up towards the north end of the city. Plan a completely different route, or prepare for some serious urban navigation.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Waterfront Trail Section CLOSED**
For you scenic runners, a section of the Waterfront Trail east of Farewell Street and Harbour Road is *still* closed for construction and realignment. Don't count on a continuous run along the lake in that area. Check the City of Oshawa's website or the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail updates before you head out, or you'll be doing an unexpected out-and-back.
</AlertBox>

Durham Region Transit also reported service adjustments due to construction on Simcoe Street and Conlin Road as of February 23rd. This further confirms ongoing heavy construction impacting major routes throughout the city.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| Overall     | Low     |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Air Quality Alert: Moderate AQI (75) due to Ozone**
Individuals with respiratory sensitivities (asthma, COPD) should consider reducing prolonged or strenuous outdoor exertion. Keep those inhalers handy and listen to your body.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for Success (and Survival)**
With temps hovering just above freezing, a windproof outer layer, gloves, and a hat are non-negotiable. Your body might feel warm once you get going, but exposed skin will suffer.
</AlertBox>

Stay safe out there, Oshawa. And remember, sometimes the best workout is the one that avoids a detour into a construction zone.
