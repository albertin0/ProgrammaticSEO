If you're looking to pound the pavement in Oshawa today, February 26, 2026, you're going to need to embrace the chill and navigate some detours.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   It's a frosty -6.4°C out there, and with a bit of wind, it'll feel even colder. Your joints are going to feel it if you don't warm up properly.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 72 AQI, with ozone being the main culprit. Not ideal for deep breaths, especially if you're sensitive.
*   Multiple key trails, including sections of Harmony Trail and the Civic Track, are currently closed. You'll need to plan your route carefully unless you enjoy unexpected U-turns.

## The Cold, Hard Truth About Today's Run

Let's not sugarcoat it: today's conditions are a mixed bag, mostly leaning towards "bundle up or freeze." The mercury is stubbornly stuck at -6.4°C and while it's clear, that just means more opportunity for that wind to slice right through your inadequately layered running gear. You'll want more than just a flimsy long-sleeve. Think technical base layers, a good mid-layer, and a windproof outer shell. Don't forget proper insulated gloves, a hat that covers your ears, and thick socks. Your toes will thank you later. The Met Office had daily high gust forecasts of 26mph for yesterday, so even if it's calmed a bit, expect a bite.

The air quality isn't doing us any favours either. With an AQI of 72 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, it's firmly in the "Moderate" category. For most of us, it means you might notice a slight irritation if you're really pushing it. If you've got any respiratory issues, maybe scale back the intensity or consider an indoor session. It's not the apocalypse, but it's certainly not pristine mountain air.

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen is low. So at least that's one less thing to make your lungs complain.

### Trail Updates: Expect Diversions

This is where things get really annoying for us local runners.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Harmony Trail Closure:** A significant section of the Harmony Trail, specifically from King St. E. to Bond St. E., is closed due to flooding "until further notice." This closure has been in effect since February 20. Don't try to sneak through; flooded trails often mean icy, treacherous footing this time of year.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Civic Track Shut Down:** If your plan was to hit the Civic Track for some speed work, forget it. It's been closed since February 24 due to moisture on the surface. That likely means it's either slushy, icy, or both, making it a fall hazard waiting to happen.
</AlertBox>

On top of that, the Joseph Kolodzie Oshawa Creek Trail near Gibb St. remains closed due to safety concerns identified around the Gibb St. bridge. And don't even get me started on the ongoing, long-term closures of parts of the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail east of Farewell St and Harbour Rd, or the massive construction on Wilson Rd. S. and Simcoe Street for bridge replacements. These aren't new today, but they're constant headaches for route planning in this city.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip:** With these closures, especially the Harmony Trail and Civic Track, plan your route *before* you head out. Don't rely on your usual loops; you'll be backtracking or forced onto busier streets. Check the City of Oshawa's service disruption page before lacing up.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're determined to get out there, be smart about it. Dress for the cold, acknowledge the air quality, and for Pete's sake, respect those trail closure signs. We've got enough injured runners, we don't need any more for a preventable slip or ill-advised shortcut.
