Alright, Oshawa, let's talk about getting outside today. You *could* do it, but you're going to need to dress smart and adjust your route.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is just "meh"

<BulletList>
*   **Crisp Air, with a Catch:** The air itself looks clear, but that moderate AQI with ozone as the dominant pollutant means your lungs won't be getting a five-star treatment. Don't go setting any personal bests today.
*   **Brutal Cold:** It's hovering around -3°C, but with the wind, it feels like a solid -5°C to -8°C. Your joints are going to feel every single one of those negative degrees if you don't layer up properly.
*   **Trail Blockades:** You're running into a couple of headaches if your usual route takes you along the water or through certain popular spots.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality & Allergens

| Pollutant          | Level  |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| General AQI        | 71     |
| Dominant Pollutant | Ozone  |
| Pollen             | Low    |

That AQI of 71 due to ozone puts us firmly in the "moderate" category. For most folks, this isn't a showstopper, but if you've got respiratory issues, or if you're planning a high-intensity session, you might notice it. Keep it chill. The good news is, pollen is low, so at least your sinuses aren't getting double-teamed.

### Don't Be a Dummy, Dress for the Deep Freeze
It's not just "cold" out there; it's *cold*. Layering is non-negotiable. Think technical base layer, insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and maybe even a face covering to protect exposed skin. Frostbite isn't a badge of honour, it's just a bad decision. Keep those extremities happy.

### Know Before You Go: Oshawa Trail & Road Closures

Listen up, because this is where your plans might hit a snag.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Harmony Creek Trail Section CLOSED
As of February 20th, a section of the Harmony Creek Trail from King Street East to Bond Street East is *closed until further notice* due to flooding. Do not try to bypass barriers. Flooding means unstable ground, slippery surfaces, and potentially dangerous swift currents. It's not worth the risk, people. Find an alternate route or just hit the treadmill. Seriously.
</AlertBox>

And it's not just Harmony Creek. If you planned on a scenic stroll:

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Midtown Mall Pedestrian Bridge Over Oshawa Creek is OUT
That pedestrian bridge over Oshawa Creek near the Midtown Mall has been temporarily closed since February 9th. So, if that's part of your loop, you'll need to re-route around it.
</AlertBox>

Also, if your winter workout routine involved getting out on the pier:

<AlertBox type="info">
### Oshawa Pier Closed for Winter
The Oshawa Pier has been temporarily closed for winter maintenance and railing removal since last October. Just a heads up, don't show up expecting to run out there.
</AlertBox>

Finally, for you indoor track warriors: the Civic Track at the Civic Recreation Complex was closed as recently as Tuesday due to moisture. While it might be open now, it's worth a quick check with the facility before you head over, just in case conditions haven't improved.

### The Verdict

It's a "bundle up and be aware" kind of day. The moderate AQI and biting cold will demand more from your body, and those trail closures mean you absolutely need to plan your route ahead of time. Stick to open paths, stay visible, and hydrate, even if you don't feel thirsty in the cold. Don't be that person needing a rescue because you ignored a "closed" sign.
