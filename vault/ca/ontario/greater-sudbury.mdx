Today in Greater Sudbury, if you're looking to get outside, it's a cold, but potentially beautiful, day for a winter workout, as long as you bundle up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Moderate:** The AQI is sitting at 67 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. This means if you're sensitive to air quality, you might notice it, especially during high-intensity efforts. It's not a red flag, but it's not pristine either.
*   **Bundle Up, Buttercup:** While the temperature is a crisp -3.4°C, it *feels* more like -10°C out there. And don't be fooled by the clear skies – tonight, we're looking at temperatures dropping as low as -23°C with wind chills potentially hitting a brutal -32°C. That's serious business for exposed skin.
*   **Trails are Ready, but Proceed with Caution:** The City has been on top of winter maintenance, with reports from earlier this month indicating the 79 kilometers of local trails are in "prime condition" for snowmobiling, which suggests they're well-maintained for winter activities. However, with these fluctuating temperatures, ice is always a sneaky culprit.

</BulletList>

You know the drill for winter running in Sudbury, but today calls for extra attention to your gear. The recent completion of five new warming huts along the Sudbury Trail Plan is great news for those tackling longer routes, giving you a place to thaw out if you push too far.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers; pollen levels are low, so your sinuses should be spared the usual winter misery.

## Watch Out for Icy Patches and Potholes

<AlertBox type="warning">
Expect slick spots, especially in shaded areas or on less-travelled paths along the Junction Creek Waterway. We're in that classic freeze-thaw cycle time of year, which means black ice can be lurking. And while city crews are already out patching potholes, they're not everywhere all at once, so keep an eye on road surfaces if you're sticking to pavement.

## Dress for Success (and Survival)

<AlertBox type="info">
Layering is key today. Start with a moisture-wicking base, add an insulating middle layer, and top it off with a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget your hat, gloves, and a neck gaiter or balaclava – those wind chills are no joke. Seriously, hypothermia and frostbite can creep up fast when the "feels like" temperature is that low.
</AlertBox>

## Air Quality Heads Up

<AlertBox type="warning">
With a moderate AQI of 67, due to ozone, consider adjusting your workout intensity if you have respiratory issues. If you start feeling any discomfort, cut your session short. It's not worth pushing it on days when the air isn't perfectly clear.
</AlertBox>

Overall, it's a decent day to get outside, especially if you're well-prepared. Just be smart, listen to your body, and don't underestimate that wind chill.
