It's cold out there, Greater Sudbury, but don't let a little nip in the air deter you completely. Just dress for it.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
-   That -5.8°C is chilly, and with any wind, it’ll feel colder than the stated "clear" condition. Layer up, or you'll regret it.
-   Air Quality is creeping into the "Moderate" zone with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not ideal if your lungs are easily irritated.
-   Pollen is low, so at least your sinuses won't be staging a rebellion today.
</BulletList>

The mercury is sitting at a crisp -5.8°C, which, let's be honest, is prime Northern Ontario winter running weather if you're geared up right. Don't be that hero in shorts thinking you're proving a point – you're just risking frostbite on your ears and fingers. The sun might be out, but the cold is real, and it often feels colder than the reported temperature. Environment Canada predicted light snow and snow showers today, with temperatures ranging from -19°C to -4°C, so be ready for changing conditions.

While we're not under an *extreme* cold warning like we were a few weeks back in early February (when wind chills hit -40°C in some areas), exposed skin can still get frostbitten fast. Pay attention to how your body feels, especially your extremities.

The Air Quality Index is sitting at 74, which lands us squarely in the "Moderate" category due to ozone. For most folks, this isn't a showstopper, but if you've got asthma, COPD, or generally feel like crud when the air isn't pristine, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to an indoor session today. No need to push it when your lungs are already working harder in the cold.

Now, a perennial favourite: construction. The city always has something going on. While there's talk of groundbreaking for the new downtown arena and event centre starting in the first quarter of 2026, and other road improvements around places like Anderson Drive, there's no immediate news of these blocking major running or multi-use trails like the path around Ramsey Lake. Still, it's Sudbury, so always keep an eye out for unexpected detours or uneven surfaces, especially if you're off the main routes.

Speaking of trails, if you're thinking about hitting up some of the multi-use trails that cross into snowmobile territory, remember that some snowmobile trails had issues earlier this season. There was a specific reminder in January about a closed trail between Copper Cliff and Lively (on Vale property) where trespassers were creating problems. Even if the snow is good now, landowner agreements are crucial. Stick to designated trails, folks, and always check the official Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs (OFSC) online guide if you're venturing onto those routes.

Here's your daily pollen breakdown, not that it matters much right now for most of us:

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Cold Exposure Risk:** Temperatures are below freezing. Dress in layers, cover exposed skin (hat, gloves, face covering), and stay hydrated. Frostbite can occur quickly.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**AQI Considerations:** With a Moderate AQI of 74 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, individuals with respiratory sensitivities should consider reducing prolonged or strenuous outdoor exertion. Listen to your body.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Respect Trail Closures:** Even if conditions *look* good, some routes, particularly snowmobile trails like the one between Copper Cliff and Lively, might be officially closed due to landowner agreements. Trespassing jeopardizes future access for everyone.
