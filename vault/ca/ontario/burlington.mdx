Alright, Burlington, let's talk about getting outside today.

Today's actually not too shabby for a late February run, but don't let the sunshine fool you; there are still some classic winter-to-spring transition shenanigans lurking on our beloved trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>

*   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI hit 71, with ozone playing the dominant role, so if your lungs are sensitive, you might feel it more than usual, even with the clear skies.
*   **Tricky Trail Surfaces:** While the snow isn't actively falling, the Royal Botanical Gardens staff noted earlier this month that trails are still snow-covered and can be a mix of icy patches and mud traps. Your ankles will thank you for wearing proper footwear.
*   **Hazardous Tree Removal:** Expect potential detours or full closures on various Conservation Halton trails, including Crawford Lake, Mount Nemo, and Rattlesnake Point. They're doing hazardous tree work through early March, so don't be surprised if your usual loop is blocked.

## The Full Breakdown

Today, February 28, 2026, we're looking at a respectable 5.5°C under clear skies. No major storms or deep freezes on the immediate horizon, which is a welcome change after the "significant weather event" that just wrapped up yesterday. However, "significant weather event" often means residual mess, especially on natural surfaces.

### Air Quality Report

Our AQI is clocking in at 71, which puts us in the "Moderate" zone. The dominant pollutant is ozone. If you're planning a high-intensity session, especially closer to traffic or industrial areas, consider dialling it back slightly. For most of us, it's tolerable, but it's not pristine mountain air, either.

### Pollen Outlook

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Low          | N/A           |

Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are still low across the board. Enjoy it while it lasts, because spring is a cruel mistress for our sinuses.

### Trail Conditions & Hazards

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** The thaw-freeze cycle means trails, especially in shaded areas or lower elevations, could be slick with ice or thick, ankle-twisting mud. Places like the Bruce Trail sections through Mount Nemo or the trails at Crawford Lake are prime candidates for this kind of mischief. Don't be that person wiping out because you wore your fashion sneakers.
</AlertBox>

Conservation Halton is still in the midst of their hazardous tree removal. This means parts of trails at places like Crawford Lake, Mount Nemo, and Rattlesnake Point might be unexpectedly closed or have crews working nearby on weekdays from 8 AM to 4 PM. Always pay attention to posted signage; those falling branches don't care about your Strava segment.

Speaking of closures, the Royal Botanical Gardens has noted that their Rock Chapel parking lot is still closed for the season, not reopening until March. Also, those York Blvd stairs at the McQuesten High Level Bridge are out of commission due to structural issues. Plan your routes accordingly if those are part of your usual grind.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Tick Check Reminder:** With temperatures above 0°C, ticks are officially active again in the Hamilton/Burlington area. Stay on marked trails, wear appropriate clothing, and always do a thorough tick check after your workout. Nobody wants Lyme disease as a souvenir.
</AlertBox>

Overall, it's a decent day to get out, but be smart about where you go and what you wear. And maybe keep an eye out for falling trees, just in case.
