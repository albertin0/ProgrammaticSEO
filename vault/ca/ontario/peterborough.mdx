Don't let that clear sky fool you, Peterborough. It's a bone-chilling day out there, and what snow we got isn't going anywhere fast, meaning slick surfaces are still the name of the game.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Those "clear" skies hide a frosty bite. With temperatures well below freezing, any lingering moisture is ice, plain and simple.
*   The recent snowfall might be over, but its icy aftermath on sidewalks and less-travelled routes isn't. Expect slippery conditions underfoot.
*   Keep an eye out for ongoing infrastructure chatter, especially around our beloved Trent-Severn Waterway. Large-scale projects like the Parks Canada infrastructure work, while not always an immediate trail block, mean increased heavy vehicle traffic on access roads and potential future detours that can mess with your favourite long run.

## Your Winter Workout Reality Check

Today's the kind of day where your breath freezes before it even leaves your mouth. The air quality might be looking good with a current AQHI of 2 (low risk) for Peterborough as of 1 PM EST today, and pollen is practically non-existent, so your lungs are getting a break. But your joints? They're on high alert.

The mercury is sitting at a brisk -4.3°C, and while Environment Canada predicted clearer skies overnight, those milder daytime temperatures earlier in the week followed by this chill mean we're in prime ice-formation territory. Expect to find black ice lurking, particularly in shaded areas, under bridges, and any spots where melted snow refroze. This isn't just a nuisance; it's a sprained ankle waiting to happen. If you're planning a run along the **Rotary Trail** or any of our beautiful lakeside paths, assume every damp patch is a hidden ice rink.

### Dressing for the Deep Freeze

<AlertBox type="info">
Layer up, people! You're not going to the cottage, you're exercising in winter. Think moisture-wicking base layers, an insulating middle layer, and a windproof, water-resistant outer shell. Don't forget your head, hands, and feet – those are typically the first to suffer. Throw on a balaclava, proper winter running gloves, and thick, warm socks. Frostbite is no joke, and it can happen faster than you think in these temperatures.

### Navigation Hazards: Watch Your Step & Your Route

Beyond the slippery stuff, remember that the City of Peterborough is always busy with *something*. While no major, immediate trail closures were announced today directly impacting the entire network, the ongoing discussions around massive projects like the high-speed rail and Trent-Severn Waterway infrastructure development mean that our usual routes aren't guaranteed forever.

<AlertBox type="warning">
Be especially vigilant around any areas adjacent to the Trent-Severn Waterway, including the sections near the Lift Lock. Parks Canada has a multi-year infrastructure project underway, and while we might not see daily trail closures, the heavy machinery, increased traffic, and potential for temporary detours on nearby roads and paths are a constant consideration. Your usual loop could have unexpected obstacles.
</AlertBox>

In short, if you're hitting the pavement or trails today, dress like you're going to the Arctic, keep your eyes glued to the ground, and be flexible with your route. Your future self (and your PT) will thank you.
