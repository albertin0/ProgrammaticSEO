Today? It’s alright, I guess. Don't go expecting pristine conditions, but you won't freeze your nose off either.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality around Oakville isn't exactly sparkling today, sitting at a moderate 71 AQI with ozone doing most of the heavy lifting. Your lungs might feel it if you're really pushing the pace.
*   Despite the "clear" skies right now, we’ve had some seriously crummy winter weather lately. Expect sneaky patches of ice, especially on shaded sections of trails like along the **Sixteen Mile Creek Trail** or on less-trafficked sidewalks. Your joints will thank you for paying attention.
*   Pollen levels are mercifully low, so at least your allergies won't be staging a full-blown assault while you're trying to get a workout in.

## The Full Breakdown for Your Oakville Workout

Let's be real, February in Oakville always feels like a bit of a tease. One minute you're thinking spring, the next you're back to scraping ice off your windshield. Today, February 28, 2026, we’re sitting at a balmy 5.4°C and it's clear out. Sounds good on paper, right? Well, if you've lived here longer than five minutes, you know better than to trust a late-February "clear" day.

### Air Quality & Allergies

| Factor             | Level   | Notes                                                        |
| :----------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Air Quality Index** | 71 (Moderate) | Dominant Pollutant: Ozone. Not ideal for sensitive lungs.    |
| **Pollen**         | Low     | Good news for allergy sufferers; no sneezing fits mid-sprint.|

That AQI of 71 is squarely in the "moderate" zone. If you're out there doing intervals or a long run, you might feel a bit more burn than usual, especially with ozone being the main culprit. It's not a "stay indoors at all costs" scenario, but if you've got any respiratory issues, maybe dial back the intensity a notch. This ain't the day to set a PR, unless your PR is "managing moderate air quality without dying."

### Watch Your Step (Seriously)

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Beware of Residual Ice:** Just because the sun's out doesn't mean those stubborn icy patches have magically disappeared. Shady spots, especially on trails and residential sidewalks, are prime candidates for black ice. Take it slow on descents and turns, and maybe consider trail shoes with a bit more grip if you're hitting anything off-pavement. Trust me, I've seen enough torn hamstrings and sprained ankles from unexpected slips to last a lifetime.
</AlertBox>

Remember that "winter weather update" from a couple of weeks ago, talking about freezing rain and ice buildup? And the snow clearing efforts from earlier this week? Those impacts don't just vanish. I'd be especially cautious along the **Sixteen Mile Creek Trail**, particularly in the ravines where the sun doesn't hit as much.

### Construction & Detours

<AlertBox type="info">
**West Oakville Commuters/Runners:** Demolition for the new Costco on Wyecroft Road is underway, and infrastructure upgrades are happening along South Service Road West. If your route takes you near Burloak Drive and the QEW, expect potential disruptions, detours, or increased traffic. Plan accordingly, or find an alternate route for a bit.
</AlertBox>

There's also still an ongoing road closure on Brookfield Crescent from earlier this month, which could mess with your usual loops if you're in that neighbourhood. Always a good idea to check the Town of Oakville's service disruptions page before you head out. Don't be that person surprised by a massive detour mid-run.

Overall, it's a decent day if you're smart about it. Dress for the cold (even 5.4°C can feel chilly with a slight breeze), be mindful of your lungs, and for the love of all that is holy, watch where you're putting your feet. Your physio bill will thank you.
