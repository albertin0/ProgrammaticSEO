Alright, Oakville, listen up. Today's one of those days where you really gotta ask yourself if that "personal best" is worth an ER visit or a week on the couch.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is *meh*, at best:

<BulletList>
    - The air isn't exactly crisp. With a Moderate AQI of 75 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, your lungs might feel like you just ran through a BBQ pit, especially if you're pushing it.
    - It's cold, folks. We're sitting at -2.3°C right now, and the wind chill could make it feel like -11°C overnight. That's enough to stiffen up even the most limber among us, and it certainly won't do your joints any favours.
    - Major sections of the Sixteen Mile Creek Heritage Trail are still closed for good reason. Erosion and falling debris mean that scenic route south of Dundas Road and east of Fourth Line is a no-go zone. Seriously, don't test it.

### Local Hazards & Tips

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert for Runners and Those with Respiratory Issues!**

An AQI of 75, with ozone as the primary culprit, means it's not the best day for high-intensity outdoor activity. If you've got asthma, COPD, or just sensitive lungs, you might want to dial it back or move your workout indoors. We live in Oakville, not L.A.; let's not train like we do.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**STAY OFF THE CLOSED SECTIONS OF SIXTEEN MILE CREEK HERITAGE TRAIL**

I can't stress this enough. The Town of Oakville isn't closing trails for fun. That section of the Sixteen Mile Creek Heritage Trail just south of Dundas Road and east of Fourth Line is compromised due to "natural erosion, rock and shale fragments migrating onto the pathway and trees and vegetation falling over and blocking the pathway." This isn't just a minor inconvenience; it's a legitimate risk of falling debris or unstable ground. Construction is ongoing, so respect the barriers and find an alternate route. Bronte Creek Provincial Park trails, on the other hand, were open as of mid-February, so that's a safer bet if you're craving some trail time.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Bundle Up and Watch Your Step!**

It's clear, but it's still winter. The ground temperature is below freezing, meaning any lingering moisture can turn to black ice without a moment's notice. Think about adding traction aids to your shoes if you're hitting any unpaved paths or shaded areas. And for goodness sake, dress in layers. Exposed skin can get frostbitten faster than you think in these temperatures with any wind. Environment Canada expects winds up to 15 km/h, which is enough to make 2.3 degrees feel a whole lot colder.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Zone Awareness**

While not directly impacting trails today, expect ongoing construction activity around Oakville. Demolition is underway for the new Costco on Wyecroft Road, with full construction starting this spring. This means increased truck traffic and localized disruptions are becoming the norm in that area. Keep your head on a swivel if your route takes you near these development sites.
