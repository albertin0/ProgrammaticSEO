Alright, Niagara, it's a pretty mixed bag out there today, but leaning towards "get it done."

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality is hovering in the moderate zone thanks to some ozone, so don't be surprised if your lungs feel it a bit more than usual, especially if you're pushing the pace.
*   Pollen is practically non-existent, so your allergies can finally catch a break – consider that a small win.
*   Temperatures are cool but not freezing, and it's clear skies, which is a blessing after the grey we often get this time of year.

## The Rundown: What to Expect on Your Run

Look, I'm not going to lie, parts of our beloved running grounds are a bit of a maze right now. If you're planning on pounding the pavement anywhere near **Portage Road**, expect some serious detours. Niagara Parks and the City are doing maintenance, which means a full road closure daily from the top of the Falls Incline Railway right down to Marineland Parkway, 6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., until March 6th. So, if your usual route takes you there, you'll be rerouted via Stanley Avenue. Plan accordingly or find a different loop. It's an inconvenience, sure, but at least it's not a full-blown blizzard.

### Trail Talk: Know Before You Go

<AlertBox type="warning">
Heads up, trail runners and hikers! The Fisherman's Trail, that scenic route across from the Whirlpool Golf Course that drops you into the Gorge, is still closed. They're doing repairs on the stairs and assessing safety, so stay off it until further notice.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
Also, if the Niagara Glen is your jam, a section of the Terrace Trail is also closed for similar stair repairs and risk mitigation. Don't be that person ignoring the signs; those repairs are for your safety.
</AlertBox>

On the bright side, the Niagara River Recreation Trail near Dufferin Islands should be clear. There was some lane reduction on the Parkway until mid-January, but that work is wrapped up. So, if you're looking for a clear, uninterrupted stretch with decent views, that's still a solid bet. Just remember, the ground might still be a bit damp in spots with that 5.7°C, so watch your footing on any unpaved sections.

<AlertBox type="info">
Environment Canada isn't issuing any weather alerts today for Niagara Falls, which means no surprise blizzards or freezing rain. Just a good, clear, brisk day for getting those miles in, as long as you navigate the closures.
</AlertBox>

As for that wild "blood-red falls" rumor from earlier this week? Pure internet nonsense. Scientists confirm no such thing happened, though they are always keeping an eye on erosion and minor seismic activity around the Falls. So, no apocalyptic warnings to worry about on your run, just the usual geological marvel.

Lace up, be smart about your routes, and enjoy the relatively mild weather while it lasts. Spring isn't *quite* here, but at least it's not trying to kill us today.
