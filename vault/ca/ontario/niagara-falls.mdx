Another day, another chance to either embrace the chill or spend it debating whether your frozen snot is a badge of honour. Today? It's a solid maybe.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   That air might look clear, but the AQI is holding steady in the "moderate" zone thanks to ozone. Your lungs will know it if you push too hard.
*   Temperatures are still below freezing. This means any residual moisture on paths, especially shaded spots or those misty areas near the Falls, is going to be slick with ice. Your ankles and knees are *not* going to thank you for a surprise slip-and-slide.
*   Winter isn't done with us. We're still in that "everything could be an ice rink" phase that started with that polar vortex earlier this month. Seriously, people, remember when the Falls itself looked partially frozen? That ice doesn't just magically disappear.

## Today's Run Down: Brace for the Brrr

Look, I get it. You've got that marathon on the calendar, or maybe you just genuinely enjoy feeling your eyelashes freeze together. But before you head out for a jog along the Niagara River Recreation Trail, let's talk reality. It's -4.4°C and clear, which sounds innocent enough. But clear skies in winter also mean anything wet from yesterday's thaw (or just plain mist from the Falls) has likely refrozen solid.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Ice, Ice, Baby!
Expect icy patches, especially on the Niagara River Recreation Trail, observation decks, and any areas that catch mist from the Falls. Trails are already treacherous from recent cold snaps. This isn't just a minor slip hazard; we're talking potential for falls that sideline you for weeks. Wear proper traction (spikes, YakTraks, *something*) or stick to well-gritted sidewalks if you absolutely must be outside. Otherwise, stay home and do some single-leg squats, your PT-trained self will thank you.

### What's Up With The Air?

Your lungs are getting a slight workout just by being out there. The Air Quality Index is at 72, which is "Moderate," with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not the end of the world, but if you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity, take it easy. Don't be that person huffing and puffing through an ozone layer.

### Trail Talk: Bruce Trail Reroutes

If you're planning to hit the Bruce Trail, keep in mind there's a long-term reroute in effect near Quarry Road in Lincoln, which started back in September 2025 and runs until May 2026. Always check the Niagara Bruce Trail Club updates before you head out, especially with current icy conditions potentially making even established paths tricky.

## The Allergy Rundown (Spoiler: It's a Non-Issue)

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for your sinuses: pollen is low today. So, at least you won't be battling frozen snot *and* allergies. Small victories, right?

<AlertBox type="info">
### Gear Up, Or Don't Go Out
This isn't the day for minimalist running gear. Layers are crucial to prevent hypothermia, and covering exposed skin is a must to ward off frostbite, which can happen quicker than you think in these temperatures. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and warm socks. And for the love of all that is holy, if you're on icy paths, wear something with grip.
