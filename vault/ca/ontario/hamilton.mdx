Listen up, Hamilton, today is not the day for an impromptu, poorly planned workout, especially if you're heading out to the trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
  - It's below freezing and the wind chill means those exposed trails are likely slick with ice, not to mention unmaintained.
  - While general air quality is okay, there are ongoing trail closures and construction in several popular spots that'll throw a wrench in your plans.
  - Dress in layers, cover your skin, and assume anything unpaved is a skating rink disguised as a path.

## Air Quality & Allergens

The good news for your sinuses is that pollen levels are currently sitting at a comfortable "Low." Breathe easy on that front.

When it comes to the air you're actually pulling into your lungs, things are a bit of a mixed bag. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) I'm seeing is 76, which puts us in the "Moderate" category, with Ozone being the dominant pollutant. This means if you're particularly sensitive, or planning a really intense, long-duration effort, you might feel it.

However, Environment Canada's Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) for Hamilton Downtown reported a "Low Risk" (score of 2) as of 7:00 AM this morning, with forecasts staying in the low-risk zone through tonight. So, if you're generally healthy, the air itself isn't a huge blocker for a moderate outdoor session.

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant |

| Low          | 76    | Ozone              |

  **Pro Tip:** Even with low pollen, if you're out for a long haul and sensitive to air quality, consider a route with less traffic exhaust, like some of the inner trail systems (if they're open, which is a big 'if' today).

## Weather & Ground Conditions

It's clear out there, which sounds lovely until you remember it's -1.5°C right now. That wind isn't helping, making it feel closer to -5°C this afternoon, dropping to a brisk -13°C wind chill overnight. No official cold weather alert is active for these specific temperatures today, but don't let that lull you into a false sense of security.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **DANGER ZONE: Icy Trails!** Many of the Hamilton Conservation Authority (HCA) trails, like those through **Dundas Valley Conservation Area**, are NOT maintained for winter conditions. That means no clearing, no sanding, no salt. Expect snow and, more importantly, *ice*. The HCA even suggested using ice cleats and hiking poles for Dundas Valley back in January due to thick ice, and it's unlikely to have improved significantly with these temperatures. Your ankles will thank you for taking this seriously.
</AlertBox>

Beyond the ice, remember those ongoing trail closures. The York Boulevard stairs at the McQuesten High Level Bridge, a common access point for the Waterfront Trail, are closed for the long haul due to structural issues. You'll need to hit the Princess Point entrance instead if that's your usual route. Also, the boardwalk at Valens Lake is out of commission until at least March 31st for replacement, and there's general construction kicking around there. If you were planning a wander through Meadowlands Conservation Area, forget it; it's still closed due to flooding from way back in October.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Watch Your Step:** Yesterday's sewer work on Dundurn Street South at Main Street West likely wrapped up this morning, but residual slush or uneven patches could still be present. Keep an eye out if your route takes you through there.
</AlertBox>

Layer up, wear appropriate footwear with serious grip, and tell someone where you're going, especially if you're hitting those less-trodden paths. Winter running in Hamilton is no joke, and today is a prime example of needing to be prepared.
