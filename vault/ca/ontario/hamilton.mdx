Look, if you're even *considering* lacing up your shoes for an outdoor run in Hamilton today, I need you to reconsider. Seriously.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

## Why today is *not* the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**It's brutally cold.** With the temperature hovering at -4.9°C and significant wind chill, you're not just risking a chilly run; you're looking at legitimate frostbite risk within minutes on exposed skin. Environment Canada has been issuing cold warnings for a reason, advising against strenuous exercise in these conditions.</li>
  <li>**Your lungs won't thank you.** The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 73, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. Mix that with freezing air, and you're just asking for airway irritation, especially if you're pushing hard. Even with low pollen, this isn't a winning combo.</li>
  <li>**Trails are a mess.** Remember that ice from a few weeks back? It's still a major factor. The trails in Dundas Valley are specifically noted as being covered in a thick layer of ice, and that's not just a suggestion to wear cleats, it's a warning against an ankle-snapping disaster. Plus, there's ongoing construction around Martin's Road in Dundas Valley and even a temporary parking closure on Scenic Drive impacting Bruce Trail access, so expect heavy equipment and detours.</li>
</BulletList>

## Pollen Breakdown: Who Cares When It's This Cold?

| Pollen Level | Dominant Type |

| Low          | N/A           |

Yeah, the pollen is low. Congratulations. Your frozen lungs still won't be enjoying the "fresh" air.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ### DANGER: Extreme Cold & Frostbite Risk
  The current temperature, combined with wind chill, puts you at high risk for frostbite. Exposed skin can suffer damage rapidly. The City of Hamilton's Medical Officer of Health explicitly advises against strenuous exercise during cold alerts, which we're essentially still under the umbrella of today. If you *must* be outside, keep it short, cover every inch of skin, and avoid caffeine and alcohol.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### WARNING: Icy Trails & Construction Zones
  Watch your footing, people. Areas like the Dundas Valley Conservation Area are still reporting thick ice. You need proper traction, like ice cleats, if you're even contemplating those paths. Also, expect construction and heavy equipment near Martin's Road within Dundas Valley, and note the parking at 1180 Scenic Drive (Bruce Trail access) is temporarily closed due to construction. Be aware of your surroundings, and seriously, consider an alternative route.

  ### TIP: Indoor Alternatives
  Instead of risking hypothermia or a broken bone, hit up a local recreation centre for an indoor track or a spin class. There are plenty of options in Hamilton to get your heart rate up without battling the elements. Your body will thank you.
