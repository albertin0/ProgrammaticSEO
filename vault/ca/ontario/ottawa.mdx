Alright, Ottawa. Today's a day for the truly dedicated, or perhaps the slightly unhinged. If you're not into frozen snot or navigating sketchy footing, maybe stick to the Peloton.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Persistent Chill:** While the sun might peek out, it's still biting cold out there, and the wind chill could make it feel a lot worse than the thermometer suggests, especially early on. Yesterday's snow isn't helping, either.
*   **Icy Surprises:** With temperatures hovering around freezing, expect any melting snow from yesterday to have refrozen into treacherous patches, particularly in shaded areas and less-trafficked pathways. Potholes are also becoming a real problem this winter, so watch your step.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI isn't terrible, but 69 with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't exactly fresh mountain air. If you've got sensitive lungs, it's something to consider.

### Weather & Conditions Breakdown

It's currently sitting at a crisp -6.4°C, but don't let that fool you. Wind chill is a real thing in this city, and it's making it feel significantly colder, dropping to -12°C with wind gusts up to 32 km/h this morning. Environment Canada was warning about reduced visibility from flurries yesterday, and while those have mostly cleared, you're still dealing with the aftermath: potentially icy and difficult-to-navigate roads and walkways.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Cold Risk:** Temperatures will feel like -12°C with the wind chill. Dress in layers, cover exposed skin, and do not underestimate how quickly frostbite can set in. Think warm socks, insulated gloves, a good hat, and a neck gaiter. Hypothermia is no joke, people.
</AlertBox>

### Trail Talk

If you're heading to **Gatineau Park**, know that yesterday saw fresh snow, but the actual groomed trail conditions are currently listed as "N/A" with "Terrain status: undefined." Translation: go in expecting anything from crunchy snow to slick ice, and plan your route accordingly. Snowshoeing or classic skiing might be your best bet, but be prepared for variable surfaces.

The Ottawa West Winter Trail, particularly around the Watts Creek pathway, has seen recent grooming but there's a noted issue with a bridge near 19th Tee, which means less frequent grooming on that specific section. If you're out there, stick to marked and recently groomed areas, and remember the etiquette: no fat-biking, cycling, walking, or snowshoeing on groomed ski trails where dedicated skiers are trying to get a glide.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch for Ice and Potholes:** Recent snow combined with fluctuating temperatures means you're going to hit icy patches. Be extra cautious on sidewalks, shaded sections of trails, and road shoulders. Ottawa's roads are already battling "hectic winter weather" and potholes are popping up like unwelcome weeds. A twisted ankle on black ice isn't a badge of honour, it's a trip to the walk-in clinic.

### Air Quality & Allergens

The AQI is sitting at 69, which is considered moderate, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not alarming, but if you're prone to respiratory issues, it's worth taking note. Otherwise, pollen is currently low, so at least your sinuses can breathe a sigh of relief.

| Overall     | Low   |

**Layer Up Smart:** Forget looking cool, think functional. Wicking base layers, an insulating middle layer, and a wind/water-resistant outer shell. Your extremities are your first line of defense against the cold, so good gloves, a warm hat, and appropriate footwear are essential. You can always shed a layer, but you can't conjure one out of thin air.
