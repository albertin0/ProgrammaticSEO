Another clear, cold day for a run, but don't get too complacent, Ottawa.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Air quality is hovering in the "moderate" range today, with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) being the dominant pollutant. It’s not a full-blown smog alert, but if you're sensitive or planning a high-intensity session, your lungs might notice it.
*   The crisp -5.8°C temperature, while beautiful under clear skies, still means business. Factor in any wind, and those exposed bits of skin and unprotected joints will feel it quickly. Wind chill was expected to make it feel like -17°C this morning.
*   Yesterday saw fresh snowfall across the city, and while plows were out, side streets and less-travelled paths like sections around the Rideau Canal Pathway could still have icy patches hiding under a thin layer of snow or just waiting to trip you up.

## Pollen Breakdown

### Your Daily Dose of Reality:

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch for Icy Patches:** Just because the sun's out doesn't mean the ice is gone. After yesterday's snow and the lingering cold, black ice is a very real threat, especially in shaded areas or on less-maintained routes. Tread carefully, especially on sidewalks and bike paths where melting and refreezing is common. Nobody needs a sprained ankle this week.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Ottawa River Pathway Construction Continues:** Heads up if your route takes you along the Ottawa River Pathway behind Parliament Hill. Sections of this popular trail are still undergoing work by the NCC, with closures expected until spring 2026. Don't get caught off guard trying to find a detour when you're already in your stride. Check the NCC's website before you head out, unless you enjoy an unplanned urban adventure involving navigating barriers.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Mind the Fine Particulates:** With an AQI of 70 and fine particulate matter as the main culprit, it’s a good day to remember that while "moderate" sounds okay, it's still not ideal for maximal lung performance. If you have any respiratory issues, consider scaling back the intensity or opting for an indoor workout if you're pushing it.

Don't be a hero, be smart. Layer up, watch your footing, and listen to your body.
