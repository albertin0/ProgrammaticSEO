If you're heading out for a run today, prepare for a decidedly *meh* experience.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Gusty Winds & Damp Chill:** Expect a brisk, damp start with winds gusting up to 44 km/h this morning, making that 1.1°C feel a lot colder. Temperatures will stay chilly, only reaching about 2°C this afternoon, and dropping to -5°C by evening. Don't be fooled by the lack of *heavy* snow; it's still winter out there.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is sitting at 74, which is in the "moderate" zone. The dominant pollutant is fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm). While not terrible, it's certainly not ideal for pushing hard, especially if your lungs are easily irritated.
*   **Slippery Surfaces & Pothole Watch:** The combination of lingering dampness and freezing temperatures means pathways could be slick. Plus, construction is ongoing, meaning new hazards on some routes, especially around the LRT.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. We're all itching to shed the winter blues, and with the "Wear Red Canada Movement Challenge" happening today, there's a push to get out and move. But let's be realistic about what you're stepping into.

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Deeply (Metaphorically)

The "moderate" AQI might sound benign, but that fine particulate matter isn't something you want to be sucking deep into your lungs during an intense interval session. If you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity, take it easy. Your low pollen count is a win, at least.

| Pollutant Type       | Level    |
| :------------------- | :------- |
| General Pollen Count | Low      |
| AQI                  | 74       |
| Dominant Pollutant   | Fine Particulate Matter (&lt;2.5µm) |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step on the Rideau Canal Pathway (and everywhere else).** While no specific trail closures are reported for today, the damp conditions combined with temperatures hovering around freezing mean any untreated sections of pathways, like parts of the Rideau Canal Pathway, could be a skating rink. Assume black ice and proceed with caution.
</AlertBox>

### Road Closures & Construction Headaches

If your workout involves cycling or running near any major arteries, be aware that construction is still a thing. Specifically, parts of Highway 174 at Trim Road have left-turn lane and off-ramp closures due to LRT construction until 7 PM tonight. This isn't just a traffic headache for drivers; it means more exhaust, potential detours, and less predictable conditions for anyone on foot or bike nearby. Stay clear if you can.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for the *Feels Like* Temperature, Not Just the Thermometer.** With wind gusts up to 47 km/h, especially early in the day, that 1.1°C (or 4°C with rain this morning) will feel significantly colder. Layer up, cover exposed skin, and make sure your gear is wind-resistant. A warm-up indoors is highly recommended today to get those joints ready for the chill.
</AlertBox>

### Looking Ahead: More Winter incoming

Don't pack away your winter running tights yet. While current extreme cold warnings have lifted (they were a real treat earlier this month, weren't they?), the forecast for Sunday, March 1st, is calling for some seriously frigid temperatures again, with wind chills plummeting to near -22°C to -30°C. So, if today feels tolerable, enjoy it, because Mother Nature isn't done with us yet.
