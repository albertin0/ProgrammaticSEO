Today's weather might look clear, but don't let the sunshine fool you into thinking it's an easy day out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Shoreline Shuffle, Interrupted:** A significant chunk of the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail in Ajax Waterfront Park is a construction zone, meaning detours or outright closures for your usual long run along the lake.
*   **Ozone's Annoying Kiss:** Our AQI is sitting at 74, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. That's "moderate," but if you've got even minor lung issues, or you're planning a hard effort, your airways might not be thrilled.
*   **Roadwork Rhapsody:** While not directly on trails, the ongoing 24/7 construction for the Bus Rapid Transit project on Kingston Road is going to make road crossings and shoulders a headache, especially if you're cycling or running sections of it.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe (or Try To)

Let's talk about that air. Low pollen is a win, especially for those of us who usually spend spring looking like we've been pepper-sprayed. So, sneeze-free running, mostly.

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- |
| Low          | 74  | Ozone              |

The real bummer here is the AQI hitting 74 due to ozone. While not "unhealthy" by the books, ozone is an irritant. It's not your friendly oxygen; it's ground-level pollution that can make your chest feel tight and your lungs burn, especially when you're sucking air during a tempo run or intervals. I've had more than a few runners come into my office complaining about a persistent cough after pushing it on days like this. You're better off keeping your efforts moderate or saving the hard work for another day.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert: Pace Yourself.** An AQI of 74 with ozone means your lungs are working harder. If you feel any irritation, slow down or cut your workout short. This isn't the day to try for a PR.

## Trail Trouble & Road Roughness

Now, for the ground beneath your feet. Or, more accurately, the ground *not* beneath your feet because it's either dug up or redirected.

The Great Lakes Waterfront Trail is currently undergoing shoreline restoration in Ajax Waterfront Park, between Lion's Point and Veteran's Point. This means a section of that beautiful lakeside path is closed for public safety. They're doing critical work moving cobbles and natural stone, and while they plan a woodchip detour in the spring, for now, expect detours or just plan to run elsewhere. It's a real shame, but better safe than sorry when heavy machinery is involved. Don't try to sneak through; those closures are there for a reason.

And if you thought the Waterfront Trail was the only issue, think again. The Achilles Rd Emergency Trail is also closed for repairs until June 12, 2026. Another key route bites the dust, forcing more rerouting for your usual loops.

**Waterfront Trail Closure: No Shortcuts!** Construction on the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail in Ajax Waterfront Park means closures. Respect the barriers and find alternate routes.

On the roads, while the immediate impact on *trails* isn't massive from the Kingston Road Bus Rapid Transit construction, it's worth noting if your route involves main thoroughfares. Beginning March 9, Kingston Road from Harwood Avenue to Galea Drive will see continuous 24-hour construction, including microtunneling. This means potential traffic delays and a need for extra vigilance if you're running or cycling near there. Pedestrians and cyclists need to be extra cautious.

## Final Verdict

It's clear and cool, which is nice for a run, but the air quality with that ozone, combined with significant trail closures on major routes like the Waterfront Trail and Achilles Rd, knocks this day down a peg. If you're heading out, stick to quieter streets or less-impacted trails, keep your intensity low, and pay attention to how your lungs feel.
