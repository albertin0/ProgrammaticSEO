Alright, Ajax, it's another one of those days where getting out there means battling the elements, so don't be a hero unless you're dressed for it.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   It's bone-chillingly cold out there, even if the sun's pretending to be friendly. Factor in wind chill, and your exposed skin is gonna regret it.
*   Air quality isn't exactly pristine, with moderate ozone levels. If your lungs are sensitive, you'll feel it.
*   Still dealing with those long-standing trail closures along the Waterfront Trail, so stick to what's open and stable.

## Today's Vitals: Cold, Clear, and a Bit Ozone-y

Look, the sky's clear, which is nice, but that -5.4°C temperature isn't just a suggestion; it's a threat. This isn't your 'crisp air' run; this is 'your snot will freeze to your face' territory. Environment Canada previously warned about wind chills in Southern Ontario feeling like -21°C, and while Ajax might not hit those extremes today, you're still looking at wind chill values pushing into the double digits below zero, especially this evening and overnight. Layer up like you're going to the Arctic, because your body will thank you. Think wicking base layers, a good insulating mid-layer, and a windproof outer shell. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and something to cover your face. Frostbite is no joke, and it sneaks up on you quicker than a surprise hill at kilometre 35.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Extreme Cold Warning: Don't Skimp on Layers
With temperatures around -5.4°C and real-feel temperatures much colder due to wind chill, exposed skin can be at risk of frostbite in minutes. Cover all skin, especially fingers, toes, ears, and nose.
</AlertBox>

On the air quality front, we're sitting at an AQI of 73, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. That's "moderate," which sounds okay, but it means some folks, especially those with respiratory conditions, might experience symptoms. It's not a stay-indoors-and-panic situation, but it's definitely not ideal for pushing your VO2 max. If you find yourself coughing or feeling tightness in your chest, dial it back or cut your run short. Your lungs are not punching bags.

### Mind the Waterfront Trail

Still dealing with the fallout from those perpetually high Lake Ontario water levels and erosion issues. Significant sections of the **Ajax Waterfront Trail** are still closed due to shoreline erosion. Specifically, the stretch between the Woodlot (east of the water plant/west of Pickering Beach Rd.) and Anstead Crescent to Finley Avenue is a no-go zone. The Paradise Beach Area also continues to see water on the road and trail. Don't be that person who ignores the pylons or "trail closed" signs. You're not just risking a twisted ankle; you're risking falling into unstable ground or getting soaked in frigid water. Stick to the paved, open sections, or better yet, head to an inland park like Rotary Park if you're looking for an uninterrupted flat run.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Ajax Waterfront Trail Closures Still in Effect
Due to ongoing erosion and high water levels, significant portions of the Ajax Waterfront Trail remain closed. Avoid closed sections, especially near Woodlot and Anstead Crescent to Finley Avenue, and exercise extreme caution around Paradise Beach.

### Pollen Report

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for your sinuses, the pollen levels are low today. One less thing to worry about if you're usually battling allergies.

### Stay Hydrated, Even When It's Cold
You still sweat in cold weather! Dehydration can hit you just as hard as in the summer. Drink up before, during, and after your workout.
