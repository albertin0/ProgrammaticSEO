It's a "bundle up, watch your step, and maybe rethink that waterfront long run" kind of day in Ajax.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is *kind of* the day (but mostly isn't)

<BulletList>
*   The Ajax Waterfront Trail, from Anstead Crescent to Finley Avenue and east of the water plant/west of Pickering Beach Road, is still largely a no-go zone. Expect significant closures due to ongoing shoreline erosion and high Lake Ontario water levels. This isn't a minor detour; it's a "don't even bother" situation for those stretches.
*   We're still deep in winter's icy embrace. While it's clear now, yesterday brought localized flurries that could have left up to 2 cm of snow in spots, creating slippery road and trail conditions, especially in shaded areas. Police have even renewed warnings to avoid Lake Ontario due to dangerously icy waters.
*   Air quality is hovering at a "moderate" 73 AQI, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. It's not terrible, but if you've got sensitive lungs, you might feel it. Factor that into your intensity.

## The Rundown

Alright, Ajax runners, listen up. Today's forecast is clear, which sounds nice, but don't let it fool you into thinking it's an easy day out there. The temperature is sitting at a brisk -2.8°C, which means that any moisture on the ground, or any leftover snow from yesterday's "heavy at times" flurries, is frozen solid. Black ice is a real threat, especially as you head out or come back in the twilight hours.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Seriously, Stay Off the Waterfront Trail (Sections)
If your usual route takes you along the Ajax Waterfront Trail, particularly the sections between Anstead Crescent and Finley Avenue, or east of the water plant and west of Pickering Beach Road, turn around. The Town of Ajax has confirmed these areas are closed due to eroding shoreline and high Lake Ontario water levels. Work is slated for spring/summer, but until then, it's unstable ground and a recipe for an injury, not a PR. Even the Paradise Beach area has water on the road and trail.
</AlertBox>

On the bright side, pollen is practically non-existent right now, so your allergies can take a much-needed break.

| Pollen Level | Dominant Pollutant | AQI Score |
| :----------- | :----------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | Ozone              | 73        |

But let's not get too comfortable. That moderate AQI with ozone as the main player means your lungs are working a bit harder than usual. It's not red alert, but it's not pristine mountain air either.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch Your Step, Especially on the Paved Stuff
That -2.8°C is enough to make any moisture on the ground turn into an invisible hazard. Be extra vigilant on sidewalks, shaded paths, and around any bridges or underpasses. A slip on the ice is a quick trip to my office for some PT. Layer up properly—wind chill can make that -2.8°C feel a lot colder, especially if you're exposed on the open trails.

### Consider Your Route
With the Waterfront Trail compromised, consider heading inland. The Duffins Creek Trail might be a better bet, but still exercise caution for ice. If you're on Kingston Road, remember the ongoing Durham-Scarborough Bus Rapid Transit construction, including nighttime work, which means reduced lanes and potential noise, though no direct trail closures were reported in the last 24 hours.

Don't be a hero, be smart. A good workout shouldn't land you in a ditch or a physiotherapist's waiting room.
