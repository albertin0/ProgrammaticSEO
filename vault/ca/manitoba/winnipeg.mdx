Alright, Winnipeg, today is the kind of day where Mother Nature is trying to lull you into a false sense of security before she really lets loose. It's a "maybe just hit the gym, or stick to the treadmill" kind of day.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

### Why today is *not* the day for your PR attempts:

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" sky is deceiving. Temperatures are hovering around -6.4°C, but with light winds picking up this afternoon, it'll feel colder, and any melting from earlier will be turning into treacherous ice. Environment Canada explicitly warns of "deceivingly slick" surfaces due to pooled water icing up before being covered by snow. Your joints will hate you.
*   The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 59, with fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5µm) being the dominant pollutant. Not terrible, but definitely not ideal for hammering those lungs, especially if you're susceptible. You’re breathing in more than just fresh winter air.
*   The city is still busy with snow plowing operations on sidewalks and pathways, and a residential parking ban started this morning at 7 a.m. You'll be dodging heavy equipment and dealing with uneven surfaces. Don't be "that guy" running too close to the plow.
</BulletList>

Look, I know you want to get out there before the *actual* blizzard hits tomorrow, but seriously, think twice about pushing it hard today. We're on the cusp of a major winter storm, with widespread blizzard conditions expected for Friday across the Manitoba lakes, including our own Lake Winnipeg. Today is the calm before that particular storm, which means prime conditions for things to get unexpectedly messy on the ground.

The Nestaweya River Trail at The Forks, for example, has seen its share of closures this season due to these exact thaw-freeze cycles creating slush and unsafe ice. While it's generally open, these kinds of fluctuating temperatures mean that while one section might look fine, the next could be a skating rink. It’s a gamble you don't need to take with your ankles.

### Watch Your Step: Icy Paths Ahead
Any moisture from today's "warm spell" will freeze solid with the evening drop in temperature and increasing winds. Expect black ice, especially on shaded paths, bridges, and any areas where snow has melted and refrozen. This is a prime sprain/fracture situation.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Don't Breathe Deep (Yet)
While not critical, an AQI of 59 with fine particulate matter isn't great. If you're sensitive, or just trying to protect your lungs, maybe opt for lower intensity or indoor activities. Hard efforts will draw those particulates deeper into your system.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Plowing Ahead
City crews are out plowing major routes and continuing on sidewalks and pathways. A residential parking ban is in effect. Be aware of heavy equipment, give them space, and know that some paths might be freshly plowed but still uneven, while others might not be done yet. Assume nothing.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, with what's coming tomorrow, maybe just take it easy today. Do some mobility work, or hit the spin bike. Your body will thank you when you're actually able to run again after this next dump of snow.
