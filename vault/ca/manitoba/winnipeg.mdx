Alright, Winnipeg, today is one of those days where you really gotta earn it if you're hitting the pavement or trails. It's clear, sure, but don't let that fool you.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is creeping towards "don't push it" territory, especially with ozone playing the dominant role. Your lungs will notice.
*   It's cold enough for your joints to complain if you're not properly layered, and recent snow means those "plowed" pathways are likely still an icy, uneven mess in spots.
*   Don't even think about skating on the Nestaweya River Trail at The Forks. It's been a slushy mess or completely closed for skating thanks to this weird winter. Stick to the overland trails there, if you must, and watch your step.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deep

Look, an AQI of 79 isn't "stay indoors and hermetically seal your house" bad, but it's not "run a PB" good either. With Ozone as the primary pollutant, especially when you're exerting yourself, you're just asking for some respiratory irritation. If you're susceptible to asthma or other lung issues, today's a great day to keep it mellow, or take it inside. Remember that time last August when wildfire smoke made the city feel like a bad campfire? While not nearly as severe, consider this a lighter, crisper version of that unpleasantness for your lungs.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality Alert:** With an AQI of 79 and Ozone as the dominant pollutant, consider reducing the intensity and duration of your outdoor workout. If you feel any chest tightness, coughing, or unusual shortness of breath, cut it short. Your lungs aren't meant to filter this stuff at high volume.

### Weather & Ground Conditions: Ice, Ice, Baby?

It's -11.2°C and clear right now, which sounds inviting enough. But let's be real, this is Winnipeg. Clear skies don't mean clear paths. We've had enough snow and melt cycles recently that sidewalks and multi-use pathways are likely a patchwork of ice, packed snow, and maybe a few sneaky puddles frozen solid. The city's been plowing major streets and pathways, but that just means the big stuff is gone; the tricky stuff remains. Think about your ankles, knees, and hips. They're not keen on sudden slips or uneven landings.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Icy Conditions Expected:** Despite clear skies, recent freeze-thaw cycles and ongoing snow clearing mean many sidewalks and pathways will be icy or uneven. Wear appropriate footwear with good grip, shorten your stride, and be extra vigilant. A broken ankle won't help your marathon training.

### Trail & Road Blocks: The Usual Winnipeg Shuffle

Beyond the ice, remember that Winnipeg is always under some form of construction or maintenance. The City of Winnipeg's own site lists numerous sidewalk and lane closures across town for everything from sewer work to building maintenance. You might find your usual route along, say, Aberdeen Avenue or even down by the University Crescent, unexpectedly blocked. Be prepared to improvise, and always prioritize your safety over sticking to a specific Strava segment.

Pollen Breakdown:

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| General     | Low     |

<AlertBox type="info">
**Pro Tip:** Even though pollen is low, wear layers and cover exposed skin. The cold, dry air can be harsh, and a good base layer makes all the difference. Consider a face covering or balaclava to warm the air you breathe and protect your face.
