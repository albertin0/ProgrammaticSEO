Today's outlook? Clear, but don't let that fool you. It's still a proper St. John's February out there, meaning whatever winter threw at us earlier this week is still lurking.

<BulletList>
*   Clear skies are a welcome sight after the last few rounds of snow, offering some actual sunlight for your run.
*   Pollen is practically non-existent, so your allergies can take a much-deserved break.
*   However, the recent dumps of snow mean lingering ice patches and monstrous snowbanks that are far more treacherous than they look, especially as temperatures stay below freezing.

### Weather & Air Quality Rundown

Look, I know a "clear" day after a blizzard or two feels like winning the lottery, but let's be real: it's still -5.7°C out there. That’s cold enough to freeze the snot right out of ya. The good news is the skies are indeed clear, which means you won't be battling whiteout conditions today.

Air quality is sitting at a moderate 65 AQI, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. It’s not terrible, but if you're prone to respiratory issues, you might feel it on those deep inhales while trying to tackle the climb up Signal Hill. The wind chill will make that -5.7°C feel a fair bit colder, so layer up or risk regretting it halfway up the trail.

### The Snow Situation: What's Hiding Underfoot?

Remember those "significant snowfall and ongoing storm conditions" from earlier in the week? And the "20 to 30 centimetres" that fell just last weekend, on top of the "50 centimetres earlier in the week" for the metro area? Yeah, that stuff doesn't just evaporate. While the City of St. John's has been "making steady progress clearing streets citywide," there's "significant widening and snow removal still needed in many neighbourhoods." This means those pristine-looking sidewalks or trails near Quidi Vidi Lake could be hiding some nasty, rock-hard ice sheets or uneven footing under a dusting of fresh powder. Snowbanks are still monumental in places, reducing visibility, especially around intersections.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** Even on clear paths, black ice is a real menace this time of year. Those massive snowbanks the plows left behind? They're not just ugly; they're vision hazards, especially for drivers trying to spot a runner darting across a street. Stick to well-maintained areas, and assume every shaded patch is pure ice.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Buttercup.** Seriously, it's not a balmy spring day. Wear moisture-wicking layers, a good wind-resistant outer shell, gloves, and a hat. Your fingers and ears will thank you, especially if you're out for any decent length of time. Don't forget reflective gear if you're out anywhere near dawn or dusk – visibility remains key against those towering snowbanks.

### Pollen Report

Nothing to report here, folks. Pollen levels are low. So at least that's one less thing for your lungs to deal with today.
