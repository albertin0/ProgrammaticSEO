Look, the skies are clear, but don't let that pretty blue fool you; today's a deceptive one for hitting the pavement or trails.

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   **Snowmageddon Aftermath:** We've had a solid run of winter storms lately, dumping upwards of 150 cm in some metro areas earlier this week. While the main roads might be passable, many St. John's sidewalks and residential streets are still grappling with uneven footing, icy patches, and snowbanks high enough to swallow a small car. Trying to get a decent pace in these conditions is an ankle sprain waiting to happen.
*   **Pippy Park Pitfalls:** Don't even think about the cross-country ski trails at Pippy Park's Winter Activity Centre. Those bad boys are still closed due to "unsafe trail conditions" as of January. Given the recent snow, it's probably less about a "lack of snow" (as initially cited) and more about a treacherous mix of deep drifts and hidden ice underfoot. Stick to the road if you absolutely must.
*   **Temperature & Air Quality Tango:** It's -4.4°C out there, which isn't exactly balmy. Your lungs are going to feel that bite, especially with a "Moderate" AQI due to Ozone. It's not awful, but it's not fresh spring air either. Make sure you're breathing through a scarf or buff to protect those airways.

### Watch Your Step (Seriously!)
Recent heavy snowfall has left many sidewalks and untreated paths in St. John's a minefield of ice and compacted snow. Visibility can also be poor around corners and intersections due to towering snowbanks. If you're out, assume every shadow is a black ice patch and every drift hides a pothole. Save the speed work for the treadmill.

### Dress for the Deception
Just because the sun's out doesn't mean it's warm. Layers are your friend. Think wicking base, insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget proper winter running shoes with good grip, a hat, and gloves. Exposed skin at -4.4°C (and colder with wind chill) is a fast track to frostnip.

### Special Weather Statement
There's an active Special Weather Statement for St. John's until 12:30 PM today. While vague, Environment Canada doesn't just issue these for fun. Be prepared for rapidly changing conditions, and if you're planning a longer outing, consider cutting it short or staying indoors until that clears. When in doubt, don't risk it.
