<BulletList>
*   **Recent Snowfall & Icy Mess:** Environment Canada warned of rapidly accumulating snow this morning, transitioning to rain or drizzle this afternoon. Even with clearing skies later, that fresh snow combined with rising temps means dense, heavy slush and slick surfaces, making roads and walkways hazardous.
*   **Lingering Winds:** While the worst of the blowing snow from this morning should be clearing, gusty winds are expected to persist, especially in exposed areas, adding another layer of challenge to your run.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is sitting at 63, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not terrible, but enough to make you think twice if you're planning an intense session, especially if you're sensitive to air pollution.

### The St. John's Winter Gauntlet

So, you're thinking of a quick jaunt around Quidi Vidi Lake or tackling a section of the Grand Concourse Trail? Think again, or at least tread *very* carefully. Our city just got slammed with "back-to-back storms" and a "record-breaking winter" for snowfall in February. We're talking about a "colossal cleanup" that's still very much underway. That means what looks like a clear path might be hiding a sheet of ice or a slush trap just waiting to twist an ankle.

The City has been busting its hump with snow removal, but with over 100 cm of snow from recent storms, it's not a quick fix. Streets are being cleared and widened, but sidewalks and trails are a different beast entirely. Even if the main roads are passable, side streets, residential areas, and particularly the trails will still be a messy, uneven, and potentially dangerous slog.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Black Ice & Hidden Hazards:** Don't let the clearer skies fool you. The freeze-thaw cycle we're getting today means that melted snow will refreeze into treacherous black ice, especially as temperatures dip overnight. Every shadow could be a slip hazard.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch for Snow Removal Equipment:** With ongoing snow removal and street widening, stay vigilant. Heavy equipment is still out there, especially on downtown streets. Give them space and assume they don't see you.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up Smart:** Even at 1.9°C, those winds will make it feel much colder. Layers are your friend, and make sure your outer layer is wind-resistant. Good waterproof footwear with aggressive tread is non-negotiable if you insist on being outside.
</AlertBox>

Seriously, folks, unless you're a seasoned ice-runner with spikes and a death wish, keep your intensity low or stick to the treadmill today. Your knees will thank you.
