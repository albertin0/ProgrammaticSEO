Alright, Calgary, another Thursday, another attempt to get those miles in. Today? It's not the worst, but you'll have to pick your battles.

<LungsJointsScore score={7} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh, Not Dire:** AQI is sitting at 75 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's "moderate" which means your lungs probably won't spontaneously combust, but if you're sensitive, you might feel it. Take it easy on the sprints, champ.
*   **Weather is Playable:** Clear skies and just under freezing at -0.2°C. That's a classic Calgary winter day – crisp, clear, and prime for some frozen snot rockets. Layer up properly, don't be a hero in shorts.
*   **Trails are Still a Minefield of Closures:** Construction is the fifth season here, and it's still making a mess of our favorite running routes. Don't expect smooth sailing everywhere.

## Current Workout Hazards

### Trail Closures & Construction Headaches

Look, if you run in this city, you're used to the constant orange cone obstacle course. But today, pay extra attention, especially if Edworthy Park is your usual stomping ground. The **Douglas Fir Trail**? Yeah, forget about it. After a brief tease of a partial reopening, it's been fully closed again since February 18 due to unsafe conditions. The City's working on it, apparently, but a full reopening is still years away. So, unless you fancy a spontaneous mudslide or a trip to the ER, stay off it.

And it's not just Douglas Fir. You've got ongoing "utility repair work" and "flood barrier construction" messing with sections of the **Bow River Pathway** near Parkdale, Montgomery, and around the Memorial Drive N.W. pedestrian overpass. If you're planning a long run along the river, expect detours, frustrations, and probably an accidental sprint through a construction zone. Plan your route, or embrace the chaos.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Upcoming Water Main Construction: Point McKay Park Area Affected

Starting March 9, the City's doing planned reinforcement work on the Bearspaw South Feeder Main. This means construction on 16 Avenue N.W., near Sarcee Trail, and potentially around **Point McKay Park**. While it's not *today*, it's close enough that you should be aware of potential impacts to pathways and noise in that area in the coming weeks. Oh, and they're bringing back water restrictions on March 9 too, so don't even think about washing your muddy shoes with the hose then.

## Your Lungs & What's Floating In Them

The air is clear enough visually, which is a nice change from the smoke-filled skies we dealt with last fall. Remember those lovely 10+ AQHI days? Yeah, we're not there. Today's AQI of 75 with Ozone isn't perfect for smashing a new 5K personal best, but for an easy recovery run or a steady long haul, it's manageable. Just don't push it too hard if you've got any respiratory quirks.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
| Ragweed     | Low   |
| Mould       | Low   |

So, your allergies should be pretty chill today. Enjoy the lack of sneezes, at least.

## The Verdict

It's a decent day to get outside if you're willing to navigate some construction and keep an eye on your effort with that moderate AQI. Dress warm, watch your footing on potentially icy spots (it's Calgary, after all), and remember that Douglas Fir Trail is still off-limits. Seriously, don't risk it.
