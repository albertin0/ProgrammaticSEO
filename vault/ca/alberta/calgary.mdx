Alright, Calgary, if you're thinking of lacing up today, you better really, *really* want it.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

### Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>**It's brutally cold.** We're talking -14.1°C with a "feels like" closer to -17°C. That's not just brisk, that's "your snot will freeze" territory. Yesterday saw wind chills down to -17°C, and today isn't much better.</li>
  <li>**Snow and Ice are still a factor.** While the heavy snowfall warnings from earlier in the week have passed, there's still a chance of light snow, and any trails or sidewalks that got hit are likely a slick, icy mess underneath a fresh dusting. Bragg Creek Trails just got 15cm of fresh snow yesterday, and while they're grooming for skiers, that doesn't mean our city pathways are cleared.</li>
  <li>**Moderate Air Quality.** An AQI of 83 with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't terrible, but it's not ideal, especially if you're pushing hard and inhaling deeply. The forecast even warned about air quality being "unhealthy for sensitive groups" today.</li>

## Environmental Breakdown

Here’s the lowdown on what you’re breathing and dealing with:

| Pollutant Type | Level/AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :------------- | :-------- | :----------------- |
| Pollen         | Low       | N/A                |
| Air Quality    | 83        | Ozone              |

## Local Hazards & Tips

<AlertBox type="danger">
  ### Extreme Cold Warning: Frostbite is a Real Threat
  Seriously, folks. It's -14.1°C and feels even colder. Exposed skin can suffer frostbite faster than you think. If you're heading out, dress in layers, cover all skin, and consider shortening your usual route. This isn't the day to test your endurance limits in a tank top.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  ### Watch Your Step – Snowy & Icy Pathways
  Recent snowfall means our beloved pathways, especially along the Bow River, are likely to be a mix of fresh powder and treacherous underlying ice. Snowfall earlier this week led to "challenging and deteriorating travel conditions". The City website lists ongoing closures on the Bow River Pathway in areas like Parkdale, Montgomery, and even portions of the Douglas Fir Trail due to watermain repairs and flood barrier construction, some stretching well into spring or even later in 2026. Expect detours and uneven surfaces. Don't be that person wiping out because you ignored the conditions. Trail running spikes or at least good traction shoes are non-negotiable if you're leaving cleared pavement.

  ### Moderate Air Quality: Listen to Your Lungs
  An AQI of 83 is in the moderate range, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. For most, it's probably fine, but if you have any respiratory issues, consider moving your workout indoors today. The forecast explicitly mentioned that air quality remains "unhealthy for sensitive groups".

Look, I get it. We're runners. We like to pretend we're tough. But there's a fine line between tough and just plain stupid. Today leans towards the latter if you're not properly prepared for the bone-chilling cold and potential for a slippery landing. Maybe hit the treadmill, or at least stick to the well-salted sidewalks of Stephen Avenue and leave the icy trails for another day.
