If you're thinking of lacing up for a run outside in Edmonton today, you might want to reconsider or at least massively scale back your plans.

<BulletList>
*   **Winter Storm Incoming:** Environment and Climate Change Canada has issued a snow squall watch for Edmonton, expecting brief, intense bands of snow and winds gusting up to 80 km/h, creating near-zero visibility. This isn't just a dusting; it's a legitimate weather event that will make outdoor activity hazardous.
*   **Temperature Plunge & Icy Trails:** The temperature is currently hovering around 4°C, but it's set to drop sharply to -13°C tonight, with rain turning to heavy flurries this afternoon. What starts as wet trails, especially in the River Valley, will quickly become treacherous icy patches. Blowing snow combined with freezing temperatures equals a recipe for slips and falls.
*   **Moderate Air Quality (but watch the wind):** While the overall AQI sits at a moderate 74 with Nitrogen dioxide as the dominant pollutant, the severe winds are going to kick up a lot of particulate matter, especially later this afternoon and evening. Environment Canada's past 24-hour AQHI shows mostly low to moderate risk, but conditions are rapidly deteriorating.

### Don't Be a Hero, Stay Indoors or Stick to Pavement

Seriously, folks. The weather forecast for Edmonton today is not a suggestion; it's a warning. The current clear skies are a cruel deception. We're looking at snow squalls, high winds, and a rapid temperature drop from 4°C to well below freezing. This means anything wet is going to freeze solid, and those charming River Valley trails, which are already prone to getting mucky and rutted when wet, are about to become ice rinks with poor visibility.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Extreme Caution: Snow Squalls & Near-Zero Visibility Expected**
Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) warns of brief but intense snow squalls with winds up to 80 km/h. This will cause sudden whiteout conditions. Navigating pathways like those around the **Blackmud Creek Ravine**, where Capital Line South LRT construction is also ongoing, will be extremely dangerous due to reduced visibility and potential for uneven, icy surfaces. If you absolutely must be outside, stay on well-lit, cleared sidewalks and keep your head up.

The general air quality from a pollutant standpoint (AQI 74) isn't terrible, and pollen is low, so allergies aren't an issue. However, "Nitrogen dioxide" mixed with high winds and blowing snow isn't exactly a lung-friendly cocktail for intense exercise.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Beware of Hidden Hazards: Construction & Changing Conditions**
Ongoing construction for major projects like the Valley Line West LRT and the Capital Line South extension means detours and closures are a constant. Even if the weather were perfect, always check for specific trail advisories, especially if you're venturing into areas like 111 Street near the Blackmud Creek Ravine, where shared-use paths might be impacted. The combination of construction hazards and rapidly worsening weather is a serious risk multiplier.

If you're still determined to get your steps in, keep it short, stay extremely close to home, and consider an indoor alternative. This isn't the day for setting PRs or exploring new routes. It's the day for staying safe and warm.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for Disaster, Not Just the Weather**
Given the rapid temperature drop and potential for heavy, blowing snow, layers are critical. Think waterproof outer shell, insulated mid-layers, and good traction on your footwear. Don't forget a hat, gloves, and something to cover your face if you're brave (or foolish) enough to be out in those winds. Bring your phone, tell someone your route, and reconsider that long run.
