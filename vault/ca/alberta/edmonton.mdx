Alright, Edmonton, listen up. Today is definitely *not* the day to hit that PR or expect a pleasant outdoor session. It's a classic February mixed bag of crud out there.

<BulletList>
*   Those bone-chilling wind gusts up to 48 km/h will make that -1.3°C feel more like -7°C or colder. Don't let the thermometer fool you; the wind chill is real.
*   Mixed precipitation, ranging from morning snow to afternoon rain and then back to snow showers, means surfaces are going to be a slick, slushy mess. Think black ice and unexpected puddles, especially on less-trafficked paths.
*   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 72 AQI, with Ozone being the dominant pollutant. Not ideal for pushing your lung capacity.

### Weather & Air Quality Breakdown

The forecast for Thursday, February 26th, is a masterclass in indecision. We're looking at snow during the day, transitioning to mixed rain and snow in the afternoon, with more snow showers expected by evening. Temps might hover around -1°C, but with those brisk winds, it'll feel significantly colder, especially in the morning when wind gusts hit 41 km/h. By afternoon, winds intensify to 48 km/h, making 3°C feel like a lot less.

Our air quality is sitting in the moderate range with an AQI of 72, and the primary pollutant is Ozone. For most folks, this isn't a huge deal, but if you've got existing respiratory issues, you might feel it more on a day like today, especially combined with the cold air.

**Pollen Levels (It's February, but for completeness):**

### Watch Your Step (and Your Neck)
Seriously, with mixed precipitation and fluctuating temperatures, icy patches are going to be everywhere. That lovely packed snow on trails like the U of A Climb? Expect it to be a treacherous mix of ice and slush today. The City of Edmonton activated its extreme weather response earlier this month due to prolonged cold, and while today isn't -20°C, the wind chill and icy conditions can still catch you off guard.

### Trail & Road Conditions: More Than Just the Weather

If you're planning a run along the River Valley trails near Louise McKinney Park, be aware that the UIAA Ice Climbing World Cup & YEG Ice Fest is kicking off today and runs through March 1st. This means increased foot traffic, potential localized detours, and general hubbub in the area. Don't go expecting a serene solitude.

### Local Tip: Embrace the Windbreaks
If you're stubborn and still heading out, consider routes that offer some shelter from the wind. Those new Winter Windbreak Comfort Nodes at Rundle Park and Victoria Park might actually be useful for once, offering a spot to warm up by a fire pit. Just remember, no sticks or pucks on the IceWays themselves.

Construction-wise, while the city isn't starting *new* major road projects this year, many big ones are still in full swing. We're talking about the ongoing Valley Line West, Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion, and the Terwillegar Drive expansion. So, if your usual route takes you anywhere near these, expect traffic disruptions even for active transport. On top of that, there are "super heavy loads" moving through the region, including on Highway 63 and Highway 14, which could impact travel. These aren't just for cars; if you're biking or running on adjacent paths, be mindful of increased vehicle presence and potential detours.

Today's conditions are frankly, a bit of a gong show. If you can, take your workout indoors. If not, layer up aggressively, wear appropriate footwear with good traction, and keep your head on a swivel.
