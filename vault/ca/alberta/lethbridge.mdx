If you’re thinking of getting out for a run today, bundle up, seriously. It’s a clear day, but Lethbridge is still firmly in winter's icy grip.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   **It’s Bitterly Cold:** While the sun might be out, the temperature is hovering around -11°C, feeling more like -17°C with the wind chill. AccuWeather labels this as "Bitterly Cold," warning of frostbite to exposed skin within 8 minutes. No amount of "mind over matter" makes up for frozen digits.
*   **Moderate Air Quality for Ozone:** Our AQI is sitting at a moderate 80, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. For most of you iron lungs, you'll probably be fine, but if you've got any respiratory sensitivities, you might feel it. Take it easy.
*   **Ice is Still a Major Hazard:** Just because it’s cold doesn’t mean the ice is safe, especially on natural bodies of water and unmaintained pathways. The City explicitly warns against going on the Oldman River, urban lakes, and storm ponds due to unpredictable ice conditions. Seriously, don't be that person.

## Local Hazards and What to Do About Them

### Extreme Cold

<AlertBox type="danger">
With temperatures feeling like -17°C, the risk of frostbite and hypothermia is significant. Exposed skin can suffer frostbite in as little as 8 minutes. This isn't a "tough it out" day; it's a "layer up or stay in" day.
</AlertBox>

If you insist on venturing out, cover *every* piece of skin. Think thermal base layers, a good mid-layer, and a windproof/water-resistant outer shell. Don't forget a balaclava or neck gaiter, a hat that covers your ears, insulated gloves or mitts, and warm, waterproof footwear with good traction. Your lungs will thank you for not breathing in straight ice, and your joints will thank you for not seizing up like an old engine.

### Icy Pathways and Water Bodies

<AlertBox type="warning">
Despite the clear skies, ice is a serious and present danger, particularly on lesser-used trails and around water. Areas like Nicholas Sheran Lake are *not* deemed safe for recreational ice use unless explicitly marked by the City, and river ice is always unpredictable.
</AlertBox>

Those gorgeous coulee trails can be deceptive. A patch of sun might melt the top layer, creating black ice underneath as soon as you hit the shade. Stick to well-maintained, cleared pathways if you absolutely must run outside. Assume every dark patch is black ice, and every snow-covered section hides a slippery surprise. Microspikes or Yaktrax are your friends today. Your PT will thank you for not showing up with a sprained ankle or a broken wrist.

### Air Quality

<AlertBox type="info">
The AQI is currently 80 due to ozone. While generally acceptable, if you have asthma, COPD, or other respiratory issues, you might want to consider an indoor workout today or significantly reduce your time outdoors and intensity.
</AlertBox>

Don't push it. If you start feeling any irritation or difficulty breathing, cut your workout short. There’s always tomorrow, assuming you don’t end up in an emergency room today.
