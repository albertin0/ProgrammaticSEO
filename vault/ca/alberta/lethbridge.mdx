Honestly, today is a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde situation, and I'd hold off on anything too ambitious outdoors, especially later.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   Enjoy the brief calm, because heavy winds and significant snow are rolling in, turning things nasty tonight and tomorrow.
*   That AQI isn't terrible, but ozone can be irritating, and those winds aren't doing anyone any favors for lung comfort or joint stability.
*   Temperatures are dropping fast, so don't let the mild afternoon fool you into thinking it's staying that way.

## Why Today Isn't the Day (Unless You're Smart About It)

Look, it's Lethbridge. We know wind. We live with wind. But today, February 26th, those infamous Chinook gusts are going to crank up, reaching as high as 70-90 km/h for the Lethbridge area, starting late this morning and increasing throughout the day. That's not a "brisk breeze" – that's a "hold onto your hat and your sense of balance" kind of wind. Trying to run or even walk some of those exposed paths in the coulees, like near the High Level Bridge, is just asking for a bad time, if not an actual trip to the physio (me).

And if the wind wasn't enough, we're staring down a proper dump of snow. Southern Alberta, including our neck of the woods, is forecasted to get anywhere from 10 to 25 centimetres of snow starting tonight and lasting into Friday. Combine that with those powerful gusts, and you've got blowing snow, reduced visibility, and rapidly deteriorating trail conditions. What might look clear this morning will be a slippery, icy mess by evening.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Extreme Winds & Heavy Snow Incoming:** Expect sustained high winds up to 90 km/h and 10-25 cm of snow starting tonight. This will create hazardous conditions, including poor visibility and slick surfaces.

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

The air quality is hovering in the moderate zone, with an AQI of 68 and ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not "stay inside and hermetically seal yourself," but if you're sensitive to respiratory irritants, especially with the high winds kicking things up, keep it in mind.

| Pollutant      | AQI | Recommendation                 |
| :------------- | :-- | :----------------------------- |
| Dominant       | 68  | Moderate                       |
| Ozone          | -   | People with respiratory issues |
| **Pollen Level** | Low | Good news for allergy sufferers |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Trail Closure Alert:** The Taunton Day Use Area – Road, which leads to the Taunton Trestle, is currently closed until March 4, 2026. If this is part of your regular route, find an alternative.
</AlertBox>

Beyond the immediate weather, keep an eye out for icy patches forming quickly once the temperatures drop and the snow starts to fall. What looks like a clear path in the afternoon could be a sheet of ice by sundown.

So, if you absolutely *must* get out, do it early. Keep it short, stick to well-maintained, cleared routes in less exposed areas, and dress for much colder conditions than the current mild temperature suggests, especially considering the wind chill. Otherwise, hit the gym or embrace some indoor training. Your lungs and joints will thank you.
