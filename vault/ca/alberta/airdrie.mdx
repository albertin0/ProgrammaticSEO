Alright Airdrie, today’s your last real shot at a decent outdoor run or walk before Mother Nature remembers it's still winter.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  - You're looking at some seriously gusty winds today, hitting 40 km/h and gusting up to 60 km/h. That wind chill, especially this morning, is no joke at -7°C, even if the actual temp hits 8°C later.
  - Air Quality is moderate with an AQI of 67, thanks to ozone. Not ideal if your lungs are sensitive, so pay attention.
  - Construction season is always lurking, and there are some specific spots you'll need to navigate or avoid on our pathways.
</BulletList>

### Today's Rundown

The sun's making a good effort this morning, but don't let it fool you entirely. While the temperature is set to climb to a balmy 8°C, those winds are going to make it feel a lot cooler, especially when you're exposed on wide-open stretches like the pathways around Nose Creek. Seriously, one minute you're feeling great, the next you're fighting a headwind that feels like it's trying to yank your toque off.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Wind Advisory:** Expect west winds gusting up to 60 km/h today. If you're planning a long run, consider routes with more tree cover or buildings for a bit of a buffer, or you'll be feeling it in your face and your quads.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the air. Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 67, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. For most of us, that's probably fine, but if you've got asthma or other respiratory issues, you might feel it. Don't push it. Your lungs work hard enough without added stress.

### Pathway Patrol & Pothole Problems

Our city crews are always working, but some projects could impact your usual routes. Starting this spring, Airdrie is replacing asphalt pathways that are in rough shape. While that's great for future runs, it means current conditions on some sections might be less than ideal. Keep an eye out for uneven surfaces, temporary detours, and general construction mess.

Specifically, if you're usually cruising the pathways that take you across the Nose Creek bridge north of Veteran's Boulevard on 8th Street, know that bridge construction is slated to kick off in the spring of 2026, and there's a temporary weight restriction and detour already in effect. Two pedestrian bridges are scheduled for replacement across Airdrie this year, so keep an eye on the city's maps if you rely on those connections. Also, a heads-up for anyone near 40 Ave SW: there's a temporary sidewalk closure until late May for utility work.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Pathways & Bridges:** Several pedestrian bridges are due for replacement in 2026, and overall pathway repairs start in June. Expect some detours. Check the City of Airdrie's "Pathways closures" section on their website for real-time updates.
</AlertBox>

Finally, with temperatures hovering around freezing (0.3°C now) and set to dip below tonight with rain or snow expected, the risk of black ice is real. Those bridges and shaded spots on pathways are prime locations for it, so watch your footing. Tomorrow's forecast looks like a proper winter day again, with snow and much colder temps, so if you're going to get out, make it today and be smart about it.
