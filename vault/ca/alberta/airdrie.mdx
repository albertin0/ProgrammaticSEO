Alright, Airdrie, let's talk about hitting the pathways today. If you’re planning a sunset or evening run, you might as well strap on some skis, because the weather's about to dump on us.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Heavy Snow Incoming:** Don't let the current mild conditions fool you. A snowfall warning is in effect for Rocky View County, including Airdrie. We're looking at 15 to 30 centimetres of snow starting this evening and continuing through Friday. That's not a dusting, folks, that's a legitimate winter wonderland trying to trip you up.
*   **Reduced Visibility & Icy Patches:** With that much snow coming down, visibility will be shot. Combine that with temperatures dropping below freezing and you've got a recipe for black ice on those supposedly clear stretches, especially near the Nose Creek pathways. The wind chill is also expected to drop to around -16 C tonight.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is sitting at 77 with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not awful, but it's not exactly fresh mountain air, either. Keep that in mind if your lungs are particularly sensitive.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The sun's out now, the temperature is currently a balmy 6.2 degrees Celsius, and you're feeling antsy after a long week. But trust me, as someone who’s scraped more ice off their knuckles than I care to admit, this is a classic Alberta bait-and-switch. The "clear" conditions are a fleeting illusion.

## Today's Environmental Breakdown

Here’s the lowdown on what’s actually floating around and what you'll be breathing in (or slipping on):

| Pollen Type    | Level  |
| :------------- | :----- |
| General Pollen | Low    |

| AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :-- | :----------------- |
| 77  | Ozone              |

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Snowfall Warning in Effect!
Seriously, Airdrie and Crossfield are under a snowfall warning, with 15-30 cm expected from tonight into Friday. Travel will be challenging, and visibility will be reduced. Consider moving your evening workout indoors or postponing until conditions improve.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch for Black Ice and Slippery Surfaces
Even before the heavy snow sets in, as temperatures dip later today and tonight, any moisture on pathways and sidewalks, especially around areas like the Nose Creek pathways, could freeze. Be extra cautious of black ice, which is notoriously hard to spot until you're on your butt. This isn't just a driving hazard; it's a running hazard too.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### Plan for Tomorrow, Too
The heavy snowfall isn't just a "tonight" problem. It's expected to continue through Friday. So, don't expect clear pathways first thing in the morning either. If you absolutely have to get out, wear traction devices (like Yaktrax) and bright, reflective gear. Let someone know your route and expected return time.
</AlertBox>

On a related note for future planning, the city has announced several construction projects starting this spring, including the replacement of a pedestrian bridge north of Veteran's Boulevard on 8th Street. While not an immediate concern for today's impending blizzard, keep an eye on the City of Airdrie's updates for pathway closures down the line. Also, be aware that starting March 9, Level 4 water restrictions mean outdoor water use, including flooding outdoor rinks, is banned. So, don't count on those community rinks for your skating fix much longer.

For now, stay safe out there (or better yet, stay *in* there) and listen to what Environment Canada is telling you. Your joints will thank you.
