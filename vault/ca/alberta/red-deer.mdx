If you're looking to get out for a run in Red Deer today, you better get it in *early* and be ready to layer up, because winter's making a dramatic comeback.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

## Why today is *not* the day (or at least, only the *early* day)

<BulletList>
*   Environment Canada has slapped us with a yellow-level snowfall warning for Red Deer and surrounding areas, kicking off this evening and continuing through Friday. We're talking 15 to 30 centimetres of the fluffy (or slushy, given the initial warmer temps) stuff.
*   Beyond the snow, expect winds gusting up to 50 km/h and temperatures plunging to -13°C, with wind chills making it feel more like -16°C. That's a recipe for a bad time, not a good workout.
*   The CPR Pedestrian Bridge is literally on the move today and tomorrow as part of its rehabilitation project. While they're doing important work, it means increased activity and potential disruptions if you're usually passing through that area.
</BulletList>

Look, the provided data says "Clear" and 4.6°C, which sounds alright for a quick jaunt. But don't let that fool you. That's the *before* picture. News from Environment Canada and local reports are screaming about a significant snowstorm rolling in this evening, bringing heavy accumulation, strong winds, and a sharp drop in temperature. So, if you're lacing up, do it *now*, and keep it short. Seriously, the trails will turn into a slippery, icy mess by sundown, and those winds are no joke on the lungs.

### The Great Outdoors: A Quick Look

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant | Temperature (°C) |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- | :--------------- |
| Low          | 69  | Ozone              | 4.6              |

The air quality, at an AQI of 69, is moderate with ozone being the main culprit. It's not ideal, but it's certainly overshadowed by the impending weather bomb. Low pollen is about the only good news, but honestly, who cares when you're fighting a blizzard?

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### Impending Snowstorm and Extreme Cold Warning!
A significant snowfall event is forecast for Red Deer starting this evening and extending into Friday, with 15-30 cm of snow expected. Coupled with strong winds and dropping temperatures to -13°C (feeling like -16°C with wind chill), conditions will quickly become hazardous. Travel is expected to be challenging with reduced visibility. Avoid unnecessary outdoor activity during the storm.

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### CPR Pedestrian Bridge Construction
The CPR Pedestrian Bridge is undergoing a major rehabilitation with complex operations, including moving the 118-year-old bridge onto new supports, happening today and tomorrow. Expect increased activity around the bridge, and note that the construction site itself is closed to non-essential personnel. If this is part of your usual route along the Red Deer trail system, be prepared for detours or plan to view from a safe distance, like the Gaetz Avenue bridge.

#### Layer Up (Seriously)
Even if you get out before the worst hits, temperatures are hovering around freezing and winds are picking up. Dress in layers, wear proper footwear with good grip, and make sure someone knows your route and expected return time. Conditions can change fast out here.
