Alright, Red Deer, listen up. Today's one of those days where you really gotta plan your route, or you're just asking for trouble.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That pesky CPR Pedestrian Bridge is literally being *moved* today and tomorrow, meaning trail detours are mandatory and you absolutely should not be anywhere near the construction site.
*   Air quality is sitting in the moderate zone thanks to ozone, which isn't going to kill you, but it's not exactly doing your lungs any favours on a long run.
*   While the temperature is hovering just below freezing, expect some noticeable wind gusts that'll make it feel colder, so layer up or you'll regret it.

## The "Great Bridge Heist" and Your Run

If your usual route involves the CPR Pedestrian Bridge, you're out of luck. The City of Red Deer is undertaking a massive, complex project today and tomorrow (February 26 and 27) to physically relocate the 118-year-old structure onto new supports. We're talking specialized cranes and engineered lifting systems. This isn't just a "minor detour" sign; this is a full-blown operation, and the site is completely off-limits to anyone not wearing a hard hat and high-vis.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**DANGER: CPR Pedestrian Bridge Closure and Heavy Construction**
The CPR Pedestrian Bridge area is a live construction zone for today, February 26th, and tomorrow, February 27th. Specialized equipment is moving a massive bridge. Do NOT attempt to run through or near the closure. Find an alternative route entirely, or risk being an actual obstacle for heavy machinery. Trail closures around the bridge have been in place for a while and are expected until August 2026.

### Air Quality: It's Okay, Not Great

Our Air Quality Index is currently 67, which falls into the "moderate" category. The dominant pollutant today is ozone. While it's not terrible, if you're sensitive or planning an intense, long-duration workout, you might notice some irritation. It's not a reason to stay inside for most, but definitely don't push for a new personal best if your chest feels tight.

## Weather & What to Wear

The official temperature is a chilly -1.5°C and it's clear out. But let's be real, Red Deer, "clear" doesn't mean "still." We're looking at wind speeds up to 13.4 mph with gusts that can hit 24.5 mph, which will drop that "feels like" temperature pretty quickly. This means proper layering is key. Think a good base layer, an insulating mid-layer, and a wind-resistant outer shell. Don't forget gloves, a hat, and maybe even a neck gaiter. Nobody likes numb fingers or frozen earlobes.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**WARNING: Gusty Winds**
North to southwest winds with gusts up to 24.5 mph are expected throughout the day. This will significantly increase the wind chill, making the -1.5°C feel much colder. Dress in layers, prioritizing wind protection.

**Tip: Check Your Footing Near the River**
Despite the clear conditions, parts of the Waskasoo Creek trail system near the riverbanks could still have icy patches from earlier snowmelt and refreeze. Tread carefully, especially in shaded areas.

## Pollen Breakdown

Good news for allergy sufferers, the pollen situation is "Low" across the board. So, at least your sniffles won't be from the local flora today.

| :---------- | :---- |
| Tree        | Low   |
| Grass       | Low   |
