Alright, Medicine Hat, listen up. Today is absolutely *not* the day to push your limits outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={3} />

<BulletList>
*   **Scorcher of a "Winter" Day:** Seriously, 27.9°C in late February? That's not normal, folks, and it's a recipe for heat exhaustion if you're not careful. This isn't your grandma's mild winter day.
*   **Still Dealing with Melt & Ice:** While the sun's beating down, remember that sudden warmth means rapid melt. Those shady spots on trails, especially around coulees like in Kin Coulee Park, are likely holding onto slick patches of ice or pooling water from yesterday's thaw. It's a joint-killer waiting to happen.
*   **Air Quality is Actually Fine:** Give credit where it's due. The air's clear with an AQI of 10 and low pollen, so your lungs are good to go, provided you're not sucking in too much of that crazy-warm air without proper hydration.

#### Extreme Heat Advisory (Yes, in February!)
Look, the numbers don't lie. 27.9°C is dangerously hot for any strenuous activity, let alone when your body isn't acclimatized to it in *February*. Your hydration needs are through the roof. If you're out there, you better be pounding water like it's going out of style. Heat-related illness isn't a joke, and it can sneak up on you faster than you think. Dehydration can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting, which is pretty much the opposite of a good workout. Stick to shaded areas, go early, or better yet, take this as a sign to hit the treadmill indoors.

#### Watch Your Step: Melt & Residual Ice
While the main hazard is heat, don't forget where we are. This unseasonable warmth means rapid snowmelt, and that water has to go somewhere. Expect saturated ground and sneaky patches of ice in shaded areas, especially on trails in lower elevations or along creek beds. Last year, around this very time, we saw trail closures in places like Saratoga Trail and the Trans-Canada Highway underpass in Kin Coulee Park due to high water levels from similar warm spells. While there aren't *current* official closures reported today for water, be smart and assume some sections might be slick or flooded. Don't risk a twisted ankle for a sunny run.

#### Construction Zone Navigation
Don't forget the city's annual pastime: construction. Medicine Hat always has a few projects going on, and 2026 is no different. You'll find ongoing work affecting various roads and sidewalks, including some major stuff on Division Avenue South and around Seventh Street at Fourth Avenue. Keep an eye on the City of Medicine Hat's construction map if you're planning a route that takes you through the concrete jungle. Detours are likely, and dodging traffic cones adds zero to your VO2 max.

Honestly, today's weather is a bit of a mind-bender for February. If you're determined to get outside, treat it like a July day. Shorten your distance, slow your pace, stay hydrated, and for the love of your knees, watch for those hidden icy patches and pooling water. Otherwise, there's no shame in hitting the gym or just taking a rest day. Your body will thank you.
