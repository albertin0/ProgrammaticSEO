Alright, Medicine Hat, listen up. Today's not the day to pretend you're an unshakeable force of nature, especially if you plan on running outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
*   **Winds are no joke.** Environment Canada has a yellow wind warning slapped on Southern Alberta, including our fair city, predicting gusts up to 90 km/h, with some reports even pushing 110 km/h in the vicinity. That's enough to knock you off your stride, or worse, blow debris into your path on the Heritage Trail Network.
*   **Ozone is lurking.** While the AQI is in the "Moderate" zone at 67, and you might think that's fine, the dominant pollutant is ozone. If you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity, that's your lungs telling you to reconsider prolonged strenuous outdoor activity. It can cause throat irritation and chest pain, and honestly, who needs that?
*   **"Clear" doesn't mean "perfect."** Sure, it's 8.4°C and "clear" right now, but temperatures are playing a game. We're looking at colder weather and chances of snow later, which means any moisture on those coulee trails is going to turn into treacherous ice or sloppy mud thanks to the freeze-thaw cycle. Don't be surprised if your feet suddenly decide to become skates.

## The Air You Breathe (or Don't)

Your lungs are probably fine for a quick walk, but if you're hitting it hard, that ozone isn't doing you any favors. Medicine Hat has actually seen statistically significant increasing trends in annual average ozone concentrations. So, if you're huffing and puffing, you're getting a good dose of something that can irritate your airways.

### Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers, the pollen count is low, so at least you won't be snotting your way through the wind.

## Watch Your Step, Seriously.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**High Wind Warning in Effect!** Wind gusts up to 90-110 km/h are expected in the Medicine Hat area today. This is a legitimate hazard for outdoor activities, especially on exposed sections of trails or near trees. Be prepared for sudden changes in direction, falling branches, or being generally buffeted around.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Freeze-Thaw Potential:** With current temperatures and forecasted drops, expect icy or muddy conditions, particularly on unmaintained sections of the Heritage Trail Network or in the coulees. Any trails not cleared of snow are used at your own risk and can be slippery. Mind your ankles, folks. A sprain or strain is way more common than you think, especially when you're slipping around.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Ozone Awareness:** The AQI is moderate due to ground-level ozone. If you have any respiratory conditions or are typically sensitive, consider dialing back the intensity or opting for an indoor workout today. Listen to your body – chest pain, dizziness, or feeling faint means stop.
</AlertBox>

Look, I'm all for getting out there, but don't be a hero. A blustery day with a side of ozone isn't worth a trip to the ER or a week off running because you twisted an ankle on black ice. If you absolutely *must* get your miles in, stick to well-lit, paved areas, away from trees that could drop branches, and consider shortening your route. Or, you know, hit the treadmill and save your lungs and joints for a better day.
