Alright, Hatters, today is *not* the day to chase that personal best outside. Unless your personal best involves battling gale-force winds and dodging flying debris, in which case, suit up, I guess.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Extreme West Winds:** We're talking gusts up to 110 km/h. That's not a breeze, that's a hazard.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** AQI is clocking in at 72 with ozone as the main culprit. Your lungs don't need that extra workout.
*   **Trail Closures:** Some trails are shut down due to ice or operations. Don't be "that guy" who ignores the signs.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. We've had some teasingly warm days lately – heck, we saw 15.7°C earlier this month, which is practically tropical for February in Medicine Hat. But today, Mother Nature seems to have a particular grudge. We're looking at a high of maybe 13°C, but that means precisely nothing when west winds are going to be strengthening all morning and peaking this afternoon with gusts that could knock you off your feet. Forget your pace, you'll be fighting for every step. Your joints will be screaming from the uneven load, and your balance will be shot. This isn't character building; it's injury bait.

### Air Quality & Pollen Breakdown

| Pollutant           | Level   | AQI (Medicine Hat) | Dominant Pollutant |
| :------------------ | :------ | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| **General Quality** | Moderate | 72                 | Ozone              |
| **Pollen**          | Low     | N/A                | N/A                |

An AQI of 72 with ozone as the dominant pollutant isn't terrible, but it's certainly not ideal. Anyone with respiratory sensitivities, or honestly, anyone who enjoys breathing easily, should seriously reconsider intense outdoor activity. It's an extra stressor on your system when you're already fighting the wind.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Wind Warning in Effect!** Seriously, folks, gusts up to 110 km/h are no joke. This isn't just unpleasant; it's dangerous. Watch for falling branches, flying debris, and don't expect to hold a straight line if you're out cycling or even running on exposed paths like those along the South Saskatchewan River.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail Closures!** Don't plan on heading to the Taunton Trestle Day Use area. The access road is currently closed until March 4th due to hazardous icy conditions. Similarly, the Black Mountain Trail Network is closed through March 22nd for timber harvest operations. Respect these closures, they're there for your safety – not to annoy you. Last year, we saw closures in Kin Coulee Park due to high water; while that's not the issue today, always check for current local alerts before you head out.

As for the river levels, the South Saskatchewan is expected to rise next week, but the city anticipates it will stay within its banks. They're in an "enhanced monitoring mode," so while we don't have immediate flood warnings today, it's something to keep an eye on if you're planning river-adjacent activities in the coming days.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, Buttercup!** Even with the temperature above freezing, that wind will cut right through you. Think wind-resistant outer layers, moisture-wicking base layers, and cover all exposed skin. Fingers and ears will be the first to suffer. A proper warm-up and cool-down are always critical, but especially on days like this when your body is already working overtime against the elements.
</AlertBox>

My professional advice? Find an indoor track or hit the gym. Your lungs, joints, and sanity will thank you. If you absolutely *must* get outside, keep it short, stay sheltered, and focus on stability, not speed. And for the love of all that is holy, secure anything that can blow away.
