Don't be fooled by the sunshine, Halifax, it's still a bit of a mixed bag out there for your outdoor sweat session today.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Leftover Winter Chaos:** Despite the clear skies, we're still digging out from those back-to-back blizzards that hammered us this week. Expect plenty of icy patches and compacted snow, especially on secondary streets and any trail not actively cleared.
*   **Ozone's Uninvited Guest:** Your lungs aren't getting a free pass either. We've got a moderate AQI of 76 today, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Not ideal for pushing hard, especially if you're sensitive.
*   **City's Eternal Construction:** If you're trying to navigate anywhere near Quinpool Road or Downtown Dartmouth, remember there are active road closures and infrastructure work happening. Expect detours and blocked paths.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. The sun is out, it's "clear," and after weeks of getting dumped on, you want to get outside. But unless you're packing microspikes and a map of every actively cleared route, you might want to adjust your expectations. Those 20-30 cm of snow we got between Monday and Tuesday don't just magically disappear. The municipality has been focusing on main roads, and good luck finding a perfectly clear path on popular spots like around Lake Banook where ice usually lingers for ages.

### Environmental Breakdown

| Pollen Level | AQI   | Dominant Pollutant | Temperature (°C) | Condition |
| :----------- | :---- | :----------------- | :--------------- | :-------- |
| Low          | 76    | Ozone              | -7.5             | Clear     |

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!** Many sidewalks, bike lanes, and especially unpaved trails will still be treacherous with ice and uneven, frozen snow. That "clear" sky is just making the glare worse on the black ice. Lower your pace, wear appropriate footwear, and seriously consider sticking to known, well-gritted areas. A broken ankle from an unseen patch of ice isn't worth a PR.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Mind the Ozone:** An AQI of 76 due to ozone means the air isn't exactly pristine. If you have respiratory issues, or just don't want to needlessly irritate your lungs, consider an easier, lower-intensity workout. Or hey, maybe take it indoors to a properly ventilated gym, just for today.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Zone Ahead:** Remember that roadwork around Quinpool and Downtown Dartmouth? It's still active, with closures stretching into next week. Don't plan your run relying on your usual route through those areas unless you've checked for detours. Nothing kills a workout vibe like hitting a giant "ROAD CLOSED" sign and having to backtrack for kilometers.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today is a day for cautious movement. If you're hitting the pavement, assume every shaded corner is a potential ice rink. If you're on the trails, good luck to you – you're probably breaking your own path through frozen crust. And for Pete's sake, dress for *actual* -7.5°C, not the optimistic sunshine.
