Don't let the clear skies fool you, Halifax; it's a bit of a mixed bag out there for a proper sweat session today.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Icy Aftermath:** We just shook off another nor'easter, and while the snow might be mostly cleared, those sneaky patches of black ice are lurking. This isn isn't just a hunch; workplace injury claims for slips and falls spike in the days following a storm. Today's still in that danger zone.
*   **Construction Chaos:** Between the perpetually ongoing Windsor Street Exchange project and various "Complete Streets" upgrades in the North End, your usual routes might be a mess. Expect detours, reduced speeds in construction zones, and maybe some new rumble strips to rattle your joints.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is sitting at 68, primarily due to fine particulate matter. It's not a red alert, but for those with sensitive lungs, it's definitely something to consider.

## Today's Run-Down in the HRM

Alright, let's break it down. The sun's out, and the temperature is a chilly but tolerable 3.8°C. Perfect for lacing up, right? Not so fast, sunshine. What we gained in clear skies, we've likely lost in treacherous footing. That last dump of snow and subsequent melt/freeze cycle means sidewalks and less-travelled paths are probably covered in a thin, invisible layer of pure misery.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Watch Your Step!
Black ice is your biggest enemy today. It might look like just a wet patch, but it'll send you flying faster than a flock of pigeons startled by a bus on Spring Garden Road. Take it slow, wear appropriate footwear with good grip, and maybe just stick to main, well-salted routes if you can. Seriously, a broken wrist or an ankle sprain from a stupid slip is not worth bragging rights.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the air. A moderate AQI of 68, with fine particulate matter as the dominant pollutant, isn't ideal. While not extreme, if you're prone to respiratory issues, you might feel it. Your lungs are getting a decent workout just processing that air, so don't push the pace too hard.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Construction Zones Are Still a Thing
The Windsor Street Exchange, specifically the ramp connecting Massachusetts Avenue to Highway 111, is locked down until late 2027. That means ongoing disruptions for anyone trying to navigate that area. And if you're thinking of running through the North End, remember the "Complete Streets" work is still progressing, likely meaning uneven surfaces and narrow passages. Always be aware of your surroundings, construction vehicles, and follow posted signage. These aren't just for cars; they're for your safety too.

For those of you eyeing some trail time, remember that while the wildfire bans are long gone, older storm damage, like that from Hurricane Lee way back in September 2025, can still impact less-maintained trails such as sections of the Five Bridges Connector Trail or parts of Sackville Lakes Provincial Park. Always check with local trail groups before venturing off the beaten, paved path. Better safe than stuck.

### Recommendation: Pavement Pounders, Pick Wisely
If you're determined to get out, consider sticking to the Halifax Waterfront Boardwalk or other high-traffic, well-maintained municipal sidewalks that would have seen thorough snow clearing and salting. Even then, maintain vigilance. This isn't the day to try for a PR.
