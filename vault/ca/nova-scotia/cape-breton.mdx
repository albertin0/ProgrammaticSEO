If you're heading out for a run today, prepare for a beautiful but potentially treacherous Cape Breton landscape that's still recovering from Monday's winter wallop.

<BulletList>
*   **Ice, Ice, Baby:** We got hit with a substantial snowfall and high winds earlier this week, followed by rain, and now it's below freezing. That means trails and sidewalks are likely a skating rink in disguise, particularly in shaded areas and less-travelled spots.
*   **Persistent Chill:** While the skies are clear, a temperature of -0.9°C feels colder than it looks, especially if there's any residual wind from the storm. Dress in layers.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The AQI is clocking in at 67, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It's not terrible, but if you have sensitive lungs, you might notice it during heavy exertion.

## Trail Conditions: What to Expect Out There

Look, the sun's out, and that's usually a cue to hit the pavement or the trails. But don't let the clear skies fool you. Monday's storm dropped anywhere from 15 to 40 centimetres of snow across Cape Breton, with heavy snow in Victoria County, followed by rain, and now we're back in the negatives. This isn't just fluffy powder anymore; it's a slick, frozen mess waiting to take you down.

Head for any of the beautiful trails in Cape Breton Highlands National Park, like the popular Skyline Trail or Middle Head Trail, and you're going to encounter significant packed snow and ice. While folks like Russ Holland were out snowshoeing Broad Cove Mountain a couple of weeks ago, today's conditions are less about fresh snow and more about hard, uneven ice underfoot. Even if you're sticking to the sidewalks in Sydney, assume black ice is lurking, especially in the early morning or evening.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Black Ice Alert!
Seriously, I'm not kidding. The recent freeze-thaw cycle following Monday's heavy snow and rain means everything is likely coated in a layer of invisible, perilous ice. Assume every shaded patch, every bridge, and every untreated surface is a slip hazard. Consider microspikes or cleats if you're heading off main roads. Your ankles will thank you.

### Lungs, Pollen, and Air Quality

For once, pollen isn't the big bad wolf. It's low, which is great news for seasonal allergy sufferers. However, the air quality isn't pristine.

| Pollutant     | Level    |
| :------------ | :------- |
| Tree Pollen   | Low      |
| Grass Pollen  | Low      |
| Weed Pollen   | Low      |

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Don't Breathe Too Deeply (If You're Sensitive)
The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 67, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. While most people won't have an issue, if you're prone to respiratory irritation, high-intensity workouts might be a bit rough today. Take it easy and listen to your body.

### Dress for the Deceptively Cold Clear Day
A clear sky at -0.9°C can feel much colder than it sounds. Wind chill can drop that perceived temperature significantly. Layer up, wear a hat, gloves, and consider a wind-resistant outer shell. Exposed skin can get frostnipped faster than you think.
