Today? Yeah, you *can* get outside, but don't just blindly sprint out the door. Cape Breton is clear, but don't let that fool you into thinking everything's smooth sailing.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That recent dumping of snow? It’s melted, refrozen, and is now hiding in every shaded corner, just waiting to catch your ankle. Assume black ice.
*   Air quality is only "moderate" thanks to ozone, so if your lungs are particularly sensitive, maybe take it easy or stick indoors.
*   Roads are clear, mostly, but watch out for that construction on Keltic Drive.

## The Rundown: Don't Break Your Neck (or Lungs)

Alright, Cape Breton, it's Thursday, February 26th, and the sun is actually making an appearance. We're at a balmy 2.9°C, which feels like a heatwave after the past few weeks. The skies are clear, and for once, Environment Canada isn't screaming about another impending blizzard. So, you're probably thinking, "Great, time to hit the trails!" Hold your horses, or your running shoes, as it were.

While the *active* snow warnings from earlier in the week are gone, you know how it goes around here. That massive snowfall we had around February 22nd and 23rd doesn't just vanish into thin air. It melts during the day, finds its way into every crack and crevice, and then freezes solid when the temperature dips below zero at night. Given our current 2.9°C, expect patchy black ice, especially on shaded paths, sidewalks, and any less-trafficked side streets or unplowed sections of the *Celtic Shores Coastal Trail* if you're venturing out that way. The Cape Breton Post even mentioned lingering snow and parts delaying repairs to Sydney River lighting today, which tells you the icy remnants are still a thing. Don't be that person who learns about friction the hard way.

### Air Quality Check

| Pollutant | Level     |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| Pollen    | Low       |
| AQI       | 67        |
| Dominant  | Ozone     |

The pollen is low, which is a win for most of us. However, the Air Quality Index is sitting at a "moderate" 67, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. This isn't dire, but if you've got any respiratory issues, or if you're planning a particularly intense, lung-busting session, you might feel it. "Moderate" means unusually sensitive people *could* experience respiratory symptoms. For most, it's probably fine, but be aware of how your body feels.

### Local Hazards

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Black Ice is Your Enemy.** Despite the "clear" skies and mild temps, assume any wet patch or shaded area could be a slick sheet of ice. This is prime ankle-twisting weather. Proceed with extreme caution, especially on any unmaintained paths or sidewalks.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Keltic Drive Detour.** Don't forget, the Campbell Brook Bridge on Keltic Drive is completely closed for replacement until July 31st. If that's part of your usual route, plan your detours now via Route 305 to Northwest Arm Road to Route 239. It's a 24/7 closure, so no sneaking through.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up, But Not Too Much.** It's above freezing, but that wind off the harbour can still cut through you. Think layers you can shed. A light jacket, long sleeve, maybe some gloves you can pocket, and a hat that'll protect your ears but won't overheat you once you get going.
</AlertBox>

Look, it's a decent day to move, but don't get complacent. This isn't summer running, and winter still has its claws in. Watch your step, watch your breath, and stay safe out there.
