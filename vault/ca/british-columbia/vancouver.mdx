Look, if you absolutely *must* get out there today, you probably can, but don't expect a smooth ride.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The skies are clear, which is a win for visibility and morale, but the air quality is riding that "moderate" line. If your lungs are sensitive to ozone, take note.
*   Pollen is low, so at least you won't be snotting your way through your workout.
*   Big chunk of the Grouse Grind is still off-limits, so don't even *think* about an early season "Mother Nature's Stairmaster" attempt.
*   Construction is a constant beast in this city, and it's making a mess of more than a few running and cycling routes.

Alright, Vancouver, February 26th. You woke up to clear skies and a decent 6.7°C, which, after the cold snap we've had, probably feels like a gift from the running gods. But don't let that sun fool you into thinking everything's daisies and PRs. While the pollen count is mercifully low, giving your sinuses a break, the Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 74, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. For most of us, that's just a bit of a sniff, but if you're prone to respiratory grumbles, maybe dial back the intensity on those interval sprints.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the "Moderate" Air
An AQI of 74 with ozone as the dominant pollutant means sensitive groups, like those with asthma or even just sensitive lungs, might experience some discomfort. Keep an eye on how you feel, and don't push it if you're feeling a bit tight.

Now, let's talk about the real joy-killers: closures and construction. First up, the legendary Grouse Grind. Forget about it. The Metro Vancouver Regional District shut it down again due to "hazardous winter conditions" and maintenance work. It's closed until "late March" at the earliest. So, if you were planning to torture your quads up the side of that mountain, you're out of luck. The nearby BCMC Route is technically open, but expect snow and ice.

Also over on the North Shore, Hastings Creek Trail has a whole central section *permanently* closed due to erosion and "repeated slope failures." That's not a temporary detour; that's Mother Nature saying "nope, not here anymore."

And don't even get me started on the constant urban obstacle course. If you're running or cycling anywhere near East Broadway between Main Street and Quebec Street, be prepared for a full closure due to the Broadway Subway Project. That's a four-month commitment, folks, since late January. Likewise, if you navigate through Marpole, Granville Street between W 57th and W 64th Avenues is down to one lane in each direction, and there are full closures on W 59th and W 62nd Avenues for sewer upgrades. It's a game of dodge-the-cones out there.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail Closures are Serious Business
Trying to bypass closed sections of the Grouse Grind or Hastings Creek Trail isn't just rude, it's genuinely dangerous. These aren't suggestions; they're for your safety due to unstable conditions or active work. Don't be "that" person who needs rescuing.

For those who love the Vancouver Seawall, good news: there are no specific event or storm-related closures announced for today. However, ongoing construction projects around the city mean you should always be aware of potential detours on routes that feed into it.

Finally, while my data shows clear skies, the city *just* extended extreme weather alert protocols until today, Feb 26, for additional shelter spaces, meaning overnight temperatures were flirting with or below freezing with windchill recently. So, even if the sun's out, keep that base layer on. Don't be a hero, be a smart runner.

### Stay Flexible
With all the construction and trail work around Vancouver, your best bet is always to check local city and park advisories *before* you head out, especially if you have a specific route in mind. And have a backup plan. Or two.
