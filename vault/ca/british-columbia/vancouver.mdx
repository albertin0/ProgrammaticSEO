It's one of those days where you might get a decent run in, but you gotta work for it.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality isn't exactly crisp, thanks to moderate ozone levels. Breathe easy, but not *too* easy.
*   While clear now, the air is cool, so layer up. It's February, not July, folks.
*   Several North Vancouver trails are either permanently compromised or undergoing construction, so don't just blindly hit your usual paths.
</BulletList>

## The Air You Breathe (or Don't)

Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it: an AQI of 83 is "moderate" but it's bumping up against that "unhealthy for sensitive groups" line. The dominant pollutant today is ozone, which is great for keeping our planet from burning up, but less great for your lungs when you're sucking it in at a high rate. If you've got asthma or are prone to respiratory irritation, today might be a good day to hit the treadmill or stick to a very easy pace. For the rest of us, it means your lungs are working a bit harder than they'd like, even if the skies are clear.

Good news for allergy sufferers, at least. The pollen count is low, so no sneezing fits mid-stride today.

## Watch Your Step: Trail and Road Hazards

While the city itself is reporting a clear 5.7°C, don't let that fool you into thinking every path is perfectly pristine.

### North Shore Trail Troubles

<AlertBox type="danger">
#### Hastings Creek Trail: Permanently FUBAR
If you're a regular on the North Shore, listen up: a significant chunk of the **Hastings Creek Trail** in North Vancouver is *permanently* closed. We're talking extensive erosion, repeated slope failures, and safety risks deemed too expensive to fix. The southern section also lost a bridge to a fallen tree and its replacement is up in the air. This isn't a temporary detour; this is a full-on "find a new route" situation. Do not try to bypass closures, you're just asking for an ankle injury or worse.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
#### Baden Powell/Sea to Sky Trail: Work in Progress
Over in Lynn Canyon, the **Baden Powell/Sea to Sky Trail** is undergoing improvement work until mid-March. The trail itself is open, but expect to see crews and possibly closed parking areas on Lillooet Road. Pay attention to signage and the workers; they're there for a reason.
</AlertBox>

### City Grind: Construction Everywhere

If you're pounding the pavement downtown or in the city proper, prepare for the usual Vancouver construction lottery. There are always upgrades, replacements, and general municipal chaos happening. For instance, the Marpole Sewer Upgrades mean Granville Street is down to one lane in each direction between W 57th and W 64th Avenues through spring. This means narrower sidewalks, more detours, and probably a few more frustrated drivers. Keep your head up and your earbuds at a reasonable volume.

<AlertBox type="warning">
#### Urban Routes: Expect Detours and Congestion
Road projects are scattered across the city. Places like Granville Street, Arbutus and W 41st Avenue, and various sewer upgrades will create shifting obstacles for your run. Stay vigilant for unexpected closures and uneven surfaces. Assume any street could have a flagger or a freshly dug trench.
</AlertBox>

On the bright side, **Stanley Park** seems to be mostly clear today. No major seawall or road closures announced, so if you're sticking to the classics, you should be fine. Just be mindful of fellow users, especially with those moderate AQI numbers suggesting some folks might be moving a bit slower.
