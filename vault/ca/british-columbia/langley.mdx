Alright, Langley, today's one of those days where you might just stick to the treadmill, not because it's truly awful out, but because it's just *meh*.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That clear sky is a mirage if your lungs are sensitive; we've got moderate ozone hanging around.
*   It's a frosty start, so layers are essential unless you enjoy shivering on the Fort to Fort Trail.
*   Construction around Highway 1 and other routes means you'll be dodging more than just slow walkers on your commute to fitness.
</BulletList>

Today in Langley, the air quality sits at a moderate 71 AQI, with ozone being our dominant pollutant. That's not the worst we've seen, but if you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity, you might feel it. "Moderate" means "acceptable for most individuals, but sensitive groups may experience minor to moderate symptoms from long-term exposure." So, if you're one of those sensitive types, maybe skip the lung-busting intervals this morning. Even for the rest of us, it's not exactly crisp mountain air.

The temperature is a chilly 4.3°C and thankfully, the skies are clear. That means no unexpected downpours to cut your run short, but also no warmth from the sun just yet. Layer up – seriously, don't skimp on the base layers, especially if you're hitting the trails along the river where that wind can cut right through you. Forecasts show clear skies and a high of 8°C later, but it drops to 1°C tonight, so plan your outdoor time accordingly.

Pollen is low today, so at least your nose won't be joining the list of things bothering your workout. Consider that a small victory.

### Local Hazards & Annoyances

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ongoing Construction Headaches:** Langley is a perpetual construction zone these days, and your workout routes are not immune. We're still dealing with significant overnight traffic diversions on Highway 1 between Glover Road and 248 Street as part of the 232 Street Interchange Project, which started on February 22 and continues through mid-March. While mostly traffic-related, the general area can be a mess. Also, keep an eye out around Glover Road between Telegraph Trail and University Drive for single-lane alternating traffic due to construction until March 31.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Road Closures Impacting Routes:** If your route takes you near Willowbrook Drive, be aware that Skytrain work has resulted in a 24-hour road closure between Fraser Highway and 196 Street, ongoing since February 19 until March 8. That's a big disruption if you usually run or cycle through there. You'll need to reroute.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Nathan Slough Bridge Advisory:** For those in the eastern parts of Langley, the Nathan Slough Bridge at 272 Street and 8800 Block has had an ongoing "Traffic impact" advisory since October 10 and it's still in effect. While it's not a full closure, it means potential delays or changes to how you might typically access areas beyond the bridge. Always check DriveBC if your route involves main roads or bridges.
</AlertBox>

There haven't been any new wildfire smoke advisories, extreme cold warnings, or significant flooding reports for Langley in the last 24 hours. The provincial BC Parks website lists some trail closures, but they're mostly for areas like Stawamus Chief or Smuggler Cove, not directly impacting Langley trails like those in Derby Reach Regional Park or Campbell Valley Park. However, always use common sense; if a path looks sketchy, trust your gut.

So, get out there if you want, but keep it moderate, dress like you're going to Siberia, and be mindful of the construction zones trying to take over our city. Your lungs (and probably your sanity) will thank you.
