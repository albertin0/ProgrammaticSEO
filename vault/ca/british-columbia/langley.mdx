Look, if you're planning to bust out a speedy tempo run outside today, you might want to reconsider.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

<BulletList>
*   **Fogged In:** Environment Canada has issued a fog advisory for Metro Vancouver, and yes, that includes us here in Langley. Expect near-zero visibility until Friday morning. This isn't just a bit misty; this is "can't see your hand in front of your face" kind of fog, which makes anything faster than a shuffle on a familiar path pretty darn risky.
*   **Roads Are a Minefield (of Construction Cones):** We've got a smattering of road closures and traffic diversions across the Township. Heading towards the Fort-to-Fort Trail from certain directions? Good luck. The westbound Fraser Highway right-turn lane onto Langley Bypass is closed today, which will be a mess. Plus, 198 Street is one-way southbound only for sanitary work, and 201 Street between 100A and 102A is completely shut down until tomorrow. Even overnight, if you're a nocturnal beast, Highway 1 is seeing diversions.
*   **Air's Okay, But Not Great:** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 73, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Not "stay indoors and seal the windows" bad, but definitely not pristine mountain air either. Combine that with trying to suck in air through a dense fog, and your lungs will probably feel it.

### Today's Environmental Breakdown:

| Pollen Level | AQI | Dominant Pollutant | Temperature (C) | Weather Condition |
| :----------- | :-- | :----------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- |
| Low          | 73  | Ozone              | 8.6             | Clear (but foggy) |

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Heads Up, Langley! Dense Fog Advisory is Real.**
Seriously, don't mess around with near-zero visibility. If you absolutely *must* run or walk outside, stick to well-lit, extremely familiar routes and wear bright, reflective gear. Assume no one can see you. Drivers certainly won't.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Construction Chaos Continues.**
If your usual route takes you anywhere near 201 Street, Fraser Highway, or Highway 1, expect delays and detours. Check DriveBC.ca before you head out, especially if you're trying to get to a spot like Derby Reach Regional Park – getting there might be half the battle today. There's construction on Highway 1 nightly, which means even if you're driving to a trailhead, those late-night runs might be impacted.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Consider the Treadmill or Indoors.**
With the fog and road closures, today might be a stellar day to hit up one of Langley's indoor options. Timms Community Centre has its fitness track, or if you're a member, Planet Fitness or Anytime Fitness are open and staffed. Save the outdoor glory for a day when you can actually see the path in front of you and don't have to dodge a rogue construction barrier.
