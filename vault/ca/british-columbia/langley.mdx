Alright, Langley runners, let's talk about hitting the pavement or trails today, February 26, 2026.

Honestly? It's a mixed bag out there, so run with caution.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** Your lungs are going to be working a bit harder than ideal. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 71, with ozone as the primary culprit. If you've got any respiratory issues, or even if you're just a normal human who prefers clean air, you might feel it. AccuWeather even flagged it as "unhealthy for sensitive groups" yesterday, with a warning that "healthy individuals may experience difficulty breathing and throat irritation with prolonged exposure". So, if you're prone to a cough after a long run, today might exacerbate it.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** Seriously, is there a single stretch of road in Langley not under construction? The Surrey Langley SkyTrain project is still a beast, causing "single-lane traffic 24/7 along most of the Fraser Highway corridor, along with some lane closures and pedestrian/cyclist detours". Forget trying to get a clear, uninterrupted run down Fraser Highway; you'll be playing hopscotch with traffic cones and dodging detours. And it's not just the SkyTrain; various road and utility works mean you'll find single-lane alternating traffic on 198 Street, 72 Avenue, 200 Street, 201 Street, and 48 Avenue, among others, for most of the workday. Your usual routes will be disrupted.
*   **Weather's Trying Its Best:** At least the weather is being cooperative, offering a clear sky and a mild 6.2°C. That's good news for your joints, which won't be battling icy patches or chilling winds. Environment Canada reports no alerts in effect for our area, which is a rare win.

## Local Hazards Rundown

### Air Quality

The "Moderate" AQI of 71 isn't going to kill you, but it's far from ideal for pushing your limits. That dominant ozone pollutant can be a real lung-irritator, especially if you're doing anything strenuous. Don't be surprised if your breathing feels a bit heavier, or you get that dry cough after a few kilometers.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Ozone Alert for Sensitive Lungs:** If you have asthma, allergies, or just generally don't enjoy breathing heavy, consider dialling back the intensity or shortening your outdoor session. Your lungs will thank you.
</AlertBox>

### Construction & Trail Disruptions

This is where the real fun begins. You'd think with all the talk about promoting active transportation, they'd at least finish one project before starting ten more.

*   **Fraser Highway Forewarning:** The SkyTrain construction is basically a permanent fixture. Expect "lane closures and pedestrian/cyclist detours" along Fraser Highway, which means your scenic route might turn into an obstacle course. There's also some "Fraser Highway Cycling Improvements" work that was slated to finish *today*, so you might encounter some lingering mess.
*   **Street Scramble:** Beyond the main arteries, you've got sanitary main replacements closing northbound 198 Street (between 54A and 56 Avenue) from 7 AM to 7 PM, and various utility works causing single-lane alternating traffic on multiple other streets. Even a right-turn lane from westbound Fraser Highway onto the Langley Bypass is closed until 5 PM. Plan your routes carefully, or better yet, assume your usual path is blocked and have a backup.
*   **Michaud Greenway Trail:** There's ongoing "Michaud Greenway Trail Paving". While specific closures for today aren't listed, it's wise to be prepared for potential detours or active work zones if you're running near Michaud Crescent.
*   **Fort Langley Focus:** Good news if you're eyeing a run through Fort Langley: the Historic Half Marathon is "officially back on track" after last year's weather woes, which means the routes through its picturesque streets and trails are likely in good shape for runners. Just watch for any local road work around the area that might not be directly related to the race.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Construction Everywhere!** Be hyper-aware of your surroundings, especially on and around Fraser Highway. Detours for pedestrians and cyclists are frequent. Don't assume your usual route is clear, and expect traffic control personnel in many areas.
</AlertBox>

So, if you're heading out, dress for the mild temps, but be ready for lung discomfort and a frustrating game of "find the clear path." Maybe hit some less-travelled neighbourhood streets if the main drags are too much of a headache.
