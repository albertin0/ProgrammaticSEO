Alright Nanaimo, if you’re looking to get out there today, it’s not the worst, but don't just blindly hit the trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={8} />

<BulletList>
*   Your lungs are getting a break today; air quality is officially "Low Risk" by Environment Canada, and pollen is barely a whisper.
*   Temperatures are sitting at a tolerable 9.4°C, but expect cloudy skies and a decent chance of showers, meaning those slick spots on boardwalks and exposed rocks are very real.
*   Various trail and park areas are dealing with ongoing construction or parking disruptions, so plan your route or be prepared to adapt.
</BulletList>

### Lungs: Breathe Easy, Mostly

Good news for your respiratory system: pollen levels are low. And while some data points to a moderate AQI of 75 with ozone as the dominant pollutant, Environment Canada's official Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) for Nanaimo indicates a "Low Risk" (score of 2) for today and into tomorrow. So, generally, you can push those intervals without worrying about gasping for lung-burning smog.

### Joints: Watch Your Step

The mild temperature is a blessing for achy joints, but don't get complacent. With cloudy conditions and a chance of rain throughout the day, those typically benign surfaces can become genuinely treacherous. The City of Nanaimo even put out a general advisory last fall about trails, boardwalks, and bridges becoming slippery and hazardous during wet weather. This isn't groundbreaking news for anyone who's lived here for more than a week, but a good reminder nonetheless.

### Local Hazards & Annoyances

**Petroglyph Trail Intermittent Closures**
If you were planning a serene stroll or a quick jog near the Petroglyph Trail, be aware that BC Parks is conducting accessibility upgrades. This means intermittent closures on the trail itself and possible disruptions to parking in the southeast day-use area. Always follow posted signage – it’s there for a reason, usually involving falling rocks or heavy equipment.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Trail Construction and Parking Woes:** Expect intermittent closures and potential parking issues on the Petroglyph Trail due to ongoing accessibility upgrades. Similarly, the Stewart Road East parking lot is closed for construction until May 1, 2026. While the park and trails remain open, find alternative parking if you usually start there. Don't be "that person" parked where you shouldn't be.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Slippery When Wet:** Given the cloudy conditions and chance of showers, assume all natural surfaces – roots, rocks, wooden bridges – are slick. Ease up on the pace on technical sections, especially if you're hitting spots like those around Westwood Lake or the various creeks. Nobody wants a twisted ankle sending them to urgent care.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today’s a decent day for a workout if you stay aware. Nanaimo isn't a wilderness, but it's not a treadmill either. Be smart, watch your footing, and pay attention to those orange cones. They're not just decorations.
