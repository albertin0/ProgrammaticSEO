It's a mixed bag today, Nanaimo: good temps for a run, but that moderate AQI with ozone is going to make your lungs work a bit harder.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
- AQI is sitting at a moderate 81 with ozone as the dominant pollutant, so plan shorter or less intense runs, especially if your lungs aren't typically thrilled with city air.
- Cool, clear skies at 5.2°C make for pleasant conditions for your joints and for avoiding that clammy, overheated feeling.
- Pollen levels are blessedly low today, so no sneezing fits interrupting your cadence.
</BulletList>

## The Air: Breathe (Carefully)

Alright, let's talk about the air. Your weather apps might be showing "clear" and, yeah, the sky *looks* fine. But the Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 81, which falls into the "moderate" category. The main culprit here is ozone. While not terrible, it means if you're part of a sensitive group – got asthma, other respiratory issues, or just notice you're more winded than usual on moderate AQI days – you might want to ease up on that long run or intense interval session. Consider swapping that outdoor sprint for a chill walk around **Westwood Lake Park** or moving your high-intensity stuff indoors. For the rest of us, it's probably fine for a typical jog, but keep an eye on how you feel.

## On the Ground: Watch Your Step (and Your Route)

The good news is, no major weather warnings are currently in effect for East Vancouver Island – Duncan to Nanaimo. So, you won't be battling gale-force winds or unexpected snow squalls in our neck of the woods today, even if other parts of BC are getting hammered.

However, construction continues to be a fact of life in Nanaimo, especially if you're trying to navigate downtown.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Downtown Detours: Commercial Street Construction**
If your route takes you anywhere near the **Commercial Street Improvements** project (Wharf to Church Street), expect detours and potential slowdowns. Pedestrians and drivers alike will need to pay extra attention. Phase 1 is ongoing, so don't assume your usual path is clear.
</AlertBox>

For those of you hitting the trails, here's what to keep in mind:

<AlertBox type="warning">
**BC Parks Trail Work Starting Tomorrow**
Heads up! BC Parks has advisories out for rock scaling and trail clean-up starting **tomorrow, February 27th, and continuing through March 31st.** While this isn't today, plan your weekend runs accordingly. Obey all posted closures, as falling rocks and debris are no joke. Security personnel will be on site to keep people safe.
</AlertBox>

If you frequent the **Petroglyph Trail**, expect intermittent closures as they're working on accessibility upgrades. Also, if you typically park at the **Stewart Road East parking lot** to access trails, know that it's closed for construction until May 1, 2026. The trails themselves are open, but you'll need to find alternative parking.

Good news for our longer-distance folks: the **Trans Canada Trail** from Timberlands Road trailhead to Harewood Mines Road, and the **Arrowsmith CPR Regional Trail**, are both currently open. The **E&N Trail** also appears to be good to go.

I haven't seen any alerts about events blocking major running routes today. Also, yesterday, there was a hazardous materials incident on Terminal Ave and a burning complaint at Beban Pky and Labieux Rd. These are likely resolved, but it's a reminder to stay aware of your surroundings.

## The Verdict

It’s a decent day to get out there, especially if you stick to a moderate pace and keep your lungs in mind with that AQI. Enjoy the cool air, but stay vigilant for construction and keep an eye on those trail advisories for tomorrow.
