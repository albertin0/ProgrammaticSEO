Today? It's one of those Nanaimo days where "clear" skies hide a subtle chill that can bite if you're not ready. Good enough to get out, but don't expect balmy spring conditions just yet.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Chilly Air & Icy Remnants:** While the sun might be out, the mercury is barely above freezing (3.8°C, but feeling closer to 0°C), meaning any moisture from yesterday could have turned into sneaky ice patches in shaded areas. Your joints will thank you for a proper warm-up.
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 73 today, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. It's not a lungbuster, but if you're sensitive, you might feel it.
*   **Low Pollen Perks:** On the bright side, allergy sufferers can rejoice. Pollen levels are blessedly low.

## The Nanaimo Rundown

Look, February 28th isn't exactly prime beach weather, even if our beautiful city likes to pretend it is. You've got clear skies, which is a win, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's warm. That 3.8°C temperature, feeling more like 0-1°C, means anything damp from earlier in the week could be a slick hazard. So, if your usual route takes you through the shadier parts of **Westwood Lake Park** or down some less-maintained back trails, assume there's ice. The City's own advice from last winter still holds: trails, boardwalks, and bridges can be treacherous when there's a chance of ice.

We're not seeing any major wind warnings for the land areas of Nanaimo right now, and thankfully, those widespread flood warnings from earlier this winter for the Englishman River and other areas have long since been rescinded. No major events are blocking trails or roads today either.

However, the air quality is "moderate" at an AQI of 73, with ozone being the main culprit. For most of us, this is just background noise, but if you're prone to respiratory issues, it's something to be aware of.

## Current Hazards

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Slippery Surfaces:** Even with clear skies, temperatures hovering around freezing mean shaded sections of trails, sidewalks, and boardwalks could still be icy. Watch your footing, especially in the mornings or evenings, and consider microspikes if you're hitting technical trails.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Dress for the "Feels Like":** That 3.8°C real temperature is less important than the 0-1°C it actually *feels* like. Layer up, wear a wind-resistant outer shell, and don't forget gloves and a hat. Cold muscles are unhappy muscles.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Watch for Construction:** While no specific trail closures due to construction were highlighted in recent news for today, downtown projects like the Commercial Street improvements are ongoing. If your route usually takes you through those areas, be prepared for detours or increased vehicle traffic.
