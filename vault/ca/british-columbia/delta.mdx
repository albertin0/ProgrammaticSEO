If you're looking to hit the trails today in Delta, you'd better check your route twice, because it's a bit of a mixed bag out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
-   That AQI is sitting at 73 with Ozone as the main player. Your lungs might feel that.
-   Multiple popular trails, including parts of Deas Island and the entire Delta Nature Reserve, are shut down for safety and construction.
-   Otherwise, the temperature is pretty decent for a run, and pollen is low.
</BulletList>

Alright, Delta runners, let's talk turkey. Today is one of those days where you need to pick your battles, or at least your routes, wisely. We've got clear skies and a comfortable 9.6 degrees Celsius, which sounds like prime running weather, right? Almost.

The sneaky part of today's forecast is that Air Quality Index. It's hanging out at a moderate 73, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Now, I don't care how "tough" you think you are, ozone isn't your friend when you're pushing your cardiovascular system. Remember those old heatwave warnings where they said ozone can irritate your lungs, making you cough or feel short of breath? Well, it's not a heatwave, but your lungs still won't appreciate gulping that stuff down during a hard effort. Take it easy or maybe stick to an indoor session if you're sensitive.

Then there's the ongoing saga of our beloved trails. If your usual go-to is **Deas Island Regional Park**, you're out of luck on several fronts. Due to the George Massey Tunnel replacement project, a chunk of those trails are closed off completely. We're talking Riverside Walk, Island Tip Trail, Sand Dune Trail, and part of the Dyke Loop are inaccessible for public safety while they do tree clearing and construction. No detours available, folks. You'll hit a fence.

And don't even think about hitting the **Delta Nature Reserve** for a peaceful jog through Burns Bog. That entire area is closed for at least the first three months of the year, possibly longer, while Metro Vancouver crews remove hazard trees and start replacing those rickety old boardwalks. It's a bummer, I know, but better safe than sorry when it comes to falling trees or unstable footing.

If you're planning a street run through Tsawwassen, keep an eye out around **56 Street and 12 Avenue**. There's fibre-optic cable installation underway that started mid-February and will run until early April. Expect some localized disruptions, cones, and maybe a flag person or two. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially if you've got your headphones in.

On the bright side, pollen is "Low," so at least your allergies won't be kicking your butt while you're trying to breathe in that moderate AQI.

## Pollen Breakdown

| Pollen Level | Status |
| :----------- | :----- |
| Overall      | Low    |

<AlertBox type="warning">
That AQI of 73 with Ozone is moderate. If you're susceptible to respiratory issues, consider scaling back your intensity or moving your workout indoors today. Your lungs will thank you.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
Avoid closed trails at Deas Island Regional Park and the Delta Nature Reserve/Burns Bog. These closures are for your safety due to active construction and hazard removal. Respect the signage; it's there for a reason.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
With the beautiful clear weather, consider a road route in areas not affected by construction, or explore some of Delta's other fantastic parks that aren't currently impacted by closures. Just be aware of potential pedestrian diversions around Tsawwassen construction zones.
