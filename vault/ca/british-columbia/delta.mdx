If you're dead set on getting outside today, Delta, you can make it work, but don't expect it to be glorious.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That "clear" weather hides a sneaky moderate Air Quality Index thanks to ozone, so your lungs might not love that morning run.
*   While it's nearly 5°C, those extreme weather shelters are still open for a reason – it *feels* colder than it looks, especially for your joints if you're not properly warmed up.
*   Good luck finding an uninterrupted run on some of our best local trails; major closures are still locking down prime spots.

## The Air & Ache Report

Let's talk about that air. While the sky's clear, our AQI is sitting at a moderate 73, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Ozone is like that annoying relative who shows up uninvited; it's an irritant, especially for anyone with existing respiratory issues, or if you're pushing hard. Moderate isn't terrible, but it's not a green light for an all-out sprint either. Keep your pace honest, but maybe save the PR attempt for a day with better air.

Then there's the temperature. At 4.9°C, it's not exactly balmy. The city's still got extreme weather shelters open because the "feels like" temperature is often at or below zero. That kind of chill, even if you can't see your breath, can stiffen up joints and make pre-run dynamic stretching even more critical. Layer up, seriously. Nobody wants a pulled hamstring because they thought "clear" meant "warm."

### Pollen Breakdown

| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for allergy sufferers, at least. Pollen's keeping its head down today.

**Watch Your Lungs on the Seawall!**
While the air looks clean, that moderate AQI with ozone as the primary culprit means your respiratory system will be working a bit harder. If you're planning a run along Boundary Bay, consider an easier effort.

## Trail Talk: More Closures Than Openings

If your usual routes include the Delta Nature Reserve, you're still out of luck. That entire area, the only publicly accessible part of the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area, remains closed for hazard tree removal and boardwalk replacement. Don't even think about trying to sneak in; this project is long-term, potentially until 2027.

And for those who love Deas Island Regional Park, much of it is a no-go zone. Tree clearing for the George Massey Tunnel replacement project has permanently shut down the Sand Dune Trail, and parts of the Dyke Loop Trail and Island Tip Trail are blocked off too. There are no detours for some sections, so plan accordingly, or just pick another park. It's a bummer, but safety first, or at least, *construction* first.

### Weekend Heads Up: Tsawwassen Dike

Planning a long run along the Tsawwassen First Nation shoreline this weekend? You need to know that starting *tomorrow*, March 1st, and running through March 10th, the foreshore dike will have TFN hunters exercising their right to hunt Brant Goose. They're asking the public to avoid marked areas along the dike for safety. Respect the space and find an alternate route if you're usually out that way.

## Construction Continues

Beyond the major park closures, general construction is still happening around Delta. There's fibre-optic cable installation along 56 Street and 12 Avenue in Tsawwassen expected to continue until early April. Always keep an eye out for lane shifts, temporary barriers, and construction vehicles on shared pathways and road shoulders. Utility upgrades are also planned throughout 2026 in areas like 84th Avenue and 112A Street in North Delta, so be aware that your usual road runs might have unexpected detours or obstacles.

**Pro Tip: Dress for the "Feels Like"**
With temperatures hovering around 5°C and the city opening shelters for below-freezing "feels like" temperatures, layers are your friend. A good base layer, a mid-layer for insulation, and a wind-resistant outer shell will serve you better than under-dressing for "clear" skies.
