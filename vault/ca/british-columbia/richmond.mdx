Alright, Richmond runners, let's talk about hitting the pavement or trails today.

Today's a mixed bag; the sky is clear, but don't let that fool you into complacency.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>

*   Our air quality isn't exactly pristine, with moderate ozone levels kicking around.
*   There's a fair bit of road construction and maintenance happening, so watch your step and your route.
*   The Richmond RCMP is still sounding the alarm on pedestrian safety, so stay vigilant out there.

## Today's Outdoor Conditions: The Nitty Gritty

The good news? The sun’s out, and at a crisp 6.7°C, it's pretty decent for getting some miles in without freezing your bits off or overheating. Plus, the pollen count is low, so for those of you with sniffles and sneezes, your lungs get a bit of a break.

### Air Quality Report

| Pollutant          | AQI | Dominant Pollutant |
| :----------------- | :-- | :----------------- |
| Overall Air Quality | 71  | Ozone              |

<AlertBox type="warning">
That AQI of 71 puts us in the 'Moderate' category, with ozone being the main culprit. For most of us, it's probably fine. But if you're like me and your lungs occasionally feel like a pair of worn-out leather boots, or if you have any respiratory issues, consider scaling back the intensity of your run. Maybe swap that sprint interval session for a brisk walk around Minoru Park, or keep your tempo run a little gentler. Listen to your body – it usually knows best, unlike that personal trainer who tells you to "push through it."

## Local Hazards & Things to Dodge

### Construction Chaos

Look, Richmond is always building something, and this week is no exception. We've got planned power outages, pole replacements, paving, and sidewalk construction affecting traffic all over. Keep an eye out, especially around Twigg Place and No. 5 Road, where BC Hydro has work scheduled. You don't want to trip over a freshly dug trench or find your favourite stretch of sidewalk closed without warning. There's also ongoing watermain replacement and intersection improvements, like the ones at Cambie Road and No. 4 Road, which means detours and uneven surfaces could be your new normal.

<AlertBox type="info">
Always check for local traffic advisories before heading out, especially if your route involves main thoroughfares or residential streets that might be getting upgrades. You might find yourself rerouting more than you expect.
</AlertBox>

### Pedestrian Perils

This is a big one, folks. The Richmond RCMP has explicitly highlighted an increase in pedestrian-involved incidents, noting high-risk driving behaviours are still a concern. Even though our weather today is clear, drivers aren't always paying attention. They've seen dangerous driving patterns on major arteries like **Westminster Highway** and No. 5 Road.

<AlertBox type="danger">
Seriously, assume every driver hasn't seen you. Wear bright colours, make eye contact, and don't take chances, especially at intersections or when crossing streets. Short daylight hours in winter months contribute to challenging conditions for all road users, so even with clear skies, caution is paramount.
</AlertBox>

Overall, it's a decent day to be outside, but it requires a bit more situational awareness than usual. Stay smart, stay safe, and enjoy that fresh, albeit ozoney, Richmond air.
