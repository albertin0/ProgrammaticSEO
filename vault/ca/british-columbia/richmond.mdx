It's a mixed bag out there today, Richmond. Clear skies are a blessing, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a completely clear run.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **The Good:** Enjoyable clear weather at 5.1°C means no excuses for skipping that outdoor session. Pollen is a non-issue at a "Low" level, so your sinuses can breathe easy.
*   **The Meh:** Air Quality Index is sitting at a "Moderate" 78, with Ozone being the dominant pollutant. It's not horrible, but if you've got sensitive lungs, consider easing up on those sprint intervals.
*   **The "Seriously, Check Your Route":** A couple of big local events and ongoing construction are going to mess with your usual flow today.

### Road Blocked: Flames Winter Carnival on Alexandra Road!

If your usual route takes you anywhere near Alexandra Road, especially the stretch around 8191, forget about it. The "Flames Winter Carnival" is happening today, February 28, 2026, from 11:30 am to 6 pm. They're turning it into a "lively winter wonderland" with food trucks and music. Sounds fun for spectators, a nightmare for runners. Plan a completely different route to avoid this major street festival.

### Traffic & Pedestrian Hazards: Construction and "Coldest Night" Event

Telus has ongoing utility work impacting traffic on Williams Road (between No. 2 Road and Swift Lane) and eastbound Steveston Highway at Railway Avenue until 5 PM today. While these aren't trail closures, roadwork means reduced space, potential uneven surfaces, and increased vehicle/pedestrian congestion if you're trying to navigate sidewalks or road shoulders in these areas.

Also, the "Coldest Night of the Year" charity walk is happening at Gilmore Park United Church from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Expect increased pedestrian traffic and potential localized detours or crowds around the church and immediate neighbourhood if you're running later in the day.

### Heads Up for Sea Island Trails

For those who love the peaceful runs on Sea Island, be aware that YVR has announced "upcoming trail closures" for the Sea Island Conservation Area (East). While the exact timing for *today* isn't specified as a definite closure, it's a good reminder to always check YVR's updates before heading out to those particular trails. You don't want to get all the way out there only to find a fence. Consider the West Dyke Trail as a solid alternative for unobstructed waterfront views and wide-open paths, though keep in mind the Vancouver Venturers Walking Club has an event planned on the Steveston - West Dyke tomorrow, March 1, 2026, so it might be busier then.

So, lace up, but be smart about where you're putting those feet. Today's all about strategic route planning to avoid the party and the potholes.
