If you're looking to pound the pavement or hit the trails, today in Richmond is a decent bet, but don't expect perfection.

<BulletList>

*   The air quality isn't exactly pristine, with moderate levels of ozone floating around. Breathe deep, but maybe don't go for any lung-busting personal bests if you're sensitive.
*   Weather-wise, it's a dream. Clear skies and mild temps mean you won't be battling the elements.
*   Keep an eye out for construction. It’s Richmond, so it’s always happening somewhere.

## The Air We Breathe (or Don't)

Let's talk about those lungs. While the pollen count is blissfully low, which is excellent news for allergy sufferers, the Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a "moderate" 71. The culprit? Ozone. Now, "moderate" isn't a red alert, but it's not ideal, either. Ozone at ground level can irritate your respiratory system, especially if you're pushing hard or have existing lung conditions. Think of it as your body having to work just a little bit harder to process the air. It might not feel like much on a casual stroll, but if you're doing hill repeats up Steveston Highway, you might notice it.

## Weather Report: Actually Good For Once

For once, the weather isn't trying to actively deter you from leaving the house. We're looking at a comfortable 9.6°C and clear skies. No miserable drizzle, no bone-chilling winds, just... nice. This is prime running weather for most of us, perfect for shedding those winter layers without freezing your extremities off. The ground should be dry, and visibility is excellent, so you can actually enjoy the views along the Fraser.

### Watch Your Step (and Your Route)

Just because the weather's behaving doesn't mean Richmond has stopped being Richmond. We've got scattered construction projects and roadwork affecting various parts of the city, which means potential detours or limited pedestrian access. For example, planned power outages and roadwork are impacting areas like Page Street, Twigg Place, and No. 5 Road at Twigg Place today, from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.. The City's general construction projects also mention potential limitations for both vehicles and pedestrians. So, if your usual loop takes you near a major thoroughfare, double-check before you head out. It's not a full-blown hazard, but an unexpected barrier can really mess with your flow on the West Dyke. Speaking of which, the West Dyke was looking great in photos yesterday, so that's still a solid option if you need a clear, flat path, just be mindful of how you get there.

### Listen to Your Body

Today is a prime example of why you need to pay attention to more than just the temperature. That moderate AQI, even with otherwise beautiful weather, can impact your workout. If you feel any irritation, shortness of breath, or just generally "off," scale back. There's no medal for pushing through discomfort when the air quality is telling you to take it easy.
