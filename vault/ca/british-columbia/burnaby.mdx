Today's a mixed bag, Burnaby. You've got clear skies but a little extra ozone hanging around, plus some key trails are still out of commission.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   AQI is hitting a moderate level thanks to ozone, so don't push it if your lungs are finicky.
*   Key trails on Burnaby Mountain and around Burnaby Lake are closed, limiting your usual routes.
*   Watch for gusty winds, especially if you're out near the water.
</BulletList>

## The Rundown for February 26, 2026

Alright, Burnaby runners, today’s looking pretty good on the temperature front, hovering around a comfortable 9.4°C and with some clear skies, at least for now. That's a welcome break from the persistent rain we often get this time of year. However, don't let the sunshine fool you entirely – we've got a couple of things to keep in mind.

First off, the air quality index is clocking in at 75, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. Now, 75 is "moderate" which means it's generally okay, but if you're usually sensitive to air pollution – maybe you've got asthma or are just prone to a cough – you might feel it. Ozone can be sneaky, especially when it's clear and cooler, accumulating closer to the ground. Environment Canada's Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) for Metro Vancouver is generally showing "Low Risk" today, meaning it's "ideal" for outdoor activities for the general population. Still, if you're feeling any irritation, listen to your body and maybe scale back that tempo run.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Mind the Ozone
If you're part of the sensitive crew (asthma, heart issues, or just easily irritated lungs), consider dialing back the intensity of your workout today. A moderate AQI with ozone can mean some discomfort.
</AlertBox>

On the ground, literally, there are a few snags. The **Velodrome Trail on Burnaby Mountain** is still indefinitely closed. Dirt erosion and aging steps mean that brutal climb is out of bounds between Mountain Air Trail and the top of Pandora Trail. Seriously, who's surprised? That thing always felt like it was testing the structural integrity of my knees more than my lungs. Plan an alternate route up the mountain if that's your usual stomping ground.

And if you're usually logging miles around **Burnaby Lake Regional Park**, be advised that several trails are closed for construction. The east side of the Little River Loop Trail, the Listening Bridge, the Deer Trail, and the Little River Bowl/Historic Langley Speedway are all closed until March while they build a new Listening Bridge. So, no scenic bridge crossings or laps on those specific sections for a while.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Trail Closures are Real
Don't just show up expecting your favorite trails to be open. The Velodrome Trail on Burnaby Mountain is indefinitely closed, and several sections around Burnaby Lake are also shut down until March. Check the City of Burnaby and Metro Vancouver park alerts before you head out.
</AlertBox>

Finally, while not a direct trail hazard, there's ongoing construction. For instance, the Central Park Water Main project means sections of Imperial Street and Empress Avenue have seen full road closures extending into "early 2026." While these are primarily road-related, they can mess with your run commute or access to certain areas, so be aware of potential detours if you're running on city streets. Expect some wind gusts up to 50 km/h near the water too, which can make things interesting on exposed paths.

So, get out there, enjoy the clear weather while it lasts, but be smart about where you go and how hard you push.
