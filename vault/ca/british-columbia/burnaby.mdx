Alright Burnaby, if you're looking to hit the trails today, February 28, 2026, it's a mixed bag, so don't just blindly lace up.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is hovering in that "meh" zone, and not everyone will be feeling it equally.</li>
  <li>Construction around some major routes and parks is still very much a thing, so plan your detours.</li>
  <li>Weather is clear and chilly, which is usually a win, but don't let it fool you into ignoring everything else.</li>
</BulletList>

Let's get real. It's 4.4°C and clear outside, which, for late February in Burnaby, feels almost like a gift. You won't be sweating through your base layer or slipping on black ice (at least not in the usual spots). That's the good news. The bad news? Your lungs might not love the air as much as your skin does.

We're sitting at an AQI of 83 today, with Ozone as the dominant pollutant. While some sources might optimistically call this "Low Risk," others are flagging it as "Poor" or "Unhealthy for sensitive groups". I don't care about the labels; I care about how *your* lungs feel. Ozone isn't your friend, especially if you're pushing hard. If you've got any kind of respiratory sensitivity, or even if you're just a normal human who prefers not to feel like you've been sucking on tailpipes, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to indoors if you're truly sensitive. Don't be a hero; nobody's giving out medals for feeling crummy.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **AQI is Moderate (83) with Ozone.** Sensitive individuals, including children, older adults, and those with heart or lung conditions, should consider reducing or rescheduling strenuous outdoor activity. Everyone else, pay attention to how you feel. If it burns, cut it out.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the delightful world of Burnaby roadwork and construction. If your usual route takes you anywhere near **Central Park**, be aware that the multi-year Central Park Water Main project means full road closures on sections of Imperial Street and Empress Avenue are *still* in effect until "early 2026". "Early 2026" technically encompasses today, so expect the usual traffic headaches and detours if you're cycling or trying to access the park from those directions. Always assume the worst with these long-term projects.

Down by **Burnaby Lake**, the new Recreation Complex construction has meant single lane closures on Kensington Avenue between Sprott Street and Joe Sakic Way. The good news is this was slated to wrap up by "early February 2026," so it *might* be clear by now. But again, this is Burnaby. Check the City's online road closures map before you head out, because "early February" can sometimes stretch like a bad hamstring.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Construction Near Central Park and Burnaby Lake:** Keep an eye out for active closures on Imperial Street, Empress Avenue, and Kensington Avenue. Detours are likely. Don't be that person surprised by a road closed sign; check the City's website if these are your usual stomping grounds.
</AlertBox>

Oh, and if you're planning a casual stroll through **Burnaby Heights** this afternoon, be aware there's a Lunar New Year celebration happening from 11 AM to around 3 PM. While it's probably more about good vibes than workout disruption, expect more foot traffic than usual if you're trying to weave your way through. Just another reason to be aware of your surroundings.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Lunar New Year Celebrations in Burnaby Heights:** From 11 AM to 3 PM today, expect increased pedestrian activity if you're in the Heights. Adjust your route or pace accordingly.
</AlertBox>

In short, it's cool and clear, but the air's a bit hazy, and parts of the city are still a construction zone. Be smart, be safe, and don't push it if your body tells you no.
