Alright, Burnaby, let's talk about hitting the trails today. Despite what that peek out the window might tell you, it's a bit of a mixed bag out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>

*   **Rainy Day Roulette:** While the sky *looks* clear right now, don't be fooled. Forecasts are calling for light to moderate rain throughout the day. That means slick surfaces, reduced visibility, and a general damp chill that'll cut through your layers if you're not prepared.
*   **Breathing Room's a Bit Tight:** Your lungs might feel it a bit more than usual. The Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 75, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. This isn't "stay indoors and seal the windows" bad, but if you're prone to respiratory irritation, you might notice it.
*   **Burnaby Mountain's Bummer:** One of our favourite spots has a major snag. The Velodrome Trail on Burnaby Mountain is still closed indefinitely. Erosion and aging steps mean that steep grind is off-limits until the City figures out a long-term fix. Don't try to "just sneak through"—it's closed for a reason, and it's not worth a twisted ankle or worse.

### Watch Your Step (and Your Head)!
With light to moderate rain expected today, those beautifully maintained trails are going to get slippery. Think twice before bombing down any inclines, especially on natural surfaces. Plus, visibility might drop, so if you're out on the roads or shared paths, keep your head up and assume nobody sees you.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Velodrome Trail is CLOSED – Seriously!
I know it's tempting, but the Velodrome Trail on Burnaby Mountain is closed for a reason. Erosion has made sections unsafe. Find an alternate route, people. Your PR isn't worth a trip to Burnaby Hospital's emergency room, which, ironically, is also dealing with its own construction.

### Ozone and Your Lungs
An AQI of 75 with ozone as the dominant pollutant means sensitive individuals (that's you, asthmatics and anyone with breathing issues) should consider dialling back the intensity or duration of their outdoor workouts. Pay attention to your body. No PR is worth struggling for air.

### Construction Zone Awareness
While some older construction notices like Kensington Avenue lane closures were slated to finish "early February," other projects, like the Burnaby Hospital redevelopment on Kincaid Street, involve ongoing lane closures and potential traffic delays. Even if a big closure has officially ended, there might be residual impacts on pedestrian or cycling routes, so stay aware around construction areas.
</AlertBox>

Overall, today isn't the worst day to get out there, but it's far from perfect. If you're heading out for a run or walk, be smart, stay safe, and maybe stick to the paved paths if the rain really picks up. And seriously, avoid that Velodrome Trail.
