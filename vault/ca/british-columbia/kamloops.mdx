Look, if you absolutely *have* to get outside today, it's doable, but you better be paying attention, especially to your footing and what you're breathing.

<BulletList>
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI is sitting at 80 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It’s not "stay indoors and panic" bad, but if you're asthmatic or have sensitive lungs, keep your easy pace and shorter distances. Don't push it.
*   **Icy, Icy Baby:** It's -1.3°C out there and clear, but that doesn't mean everything's dry. We've had some melt-freeze cycles, and the Overlander Ski Club at Stake Lake is specifically warning about "very thin fresh snow" leading to "icy conditions" on their re-opened trails. The parking area itself is "very icy." Assume any shaded path or less-trafficked area could be a slick trap.
*   **Tranquille Road is Still a Mess:** That Phase 3 sanitary main and road enhancement project between Crestline Street and Windbreak Street is full steam ahead. Tranquille Road itself is local traffic only, with no thru-traffic permitted, and detours are in effect using Parkcrest Avenue. If your route involves Tranquille, plan on serious detours or just pick somewhere else.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Watch Your Step: Icy Conditions!
Don't let the sunshine fool you. With temperatures hovering around freezing, black ice and unseen slick spots are a real risk, particularly on trails, sidewalks, and any paved areas that got a bit of melt yesterday. Consider microspikes if you're hitting any trails like those around Stake Lake.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Tranquille Road Construction Ahead
Seriously, avoid trying to run or cycle on Tranquille Road between Crestline Street and Windbreak Street if you're not local traffic. It's a full-on construction zone with significant delays and congestion. It's not worth the frustration or the risk of dodging heavy equipment.
</AlertBox>

### Mind the Ozone
While pollen is low, the moderate AQI of 80, with ozone as the main culprit, means that high-intensity workouts might be more taxing on your respiratory system than usual. Take it easy and listen to your body.
