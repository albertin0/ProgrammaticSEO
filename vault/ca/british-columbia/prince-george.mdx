Another clear, cold Prince George morning. You want to run? Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you about the ice out there.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  *   That -11.4°C temperature means dressing for serious cold, and frankly, a lot of the usual mud spots along the Greenway Trail are probably solid ice sheets now. Think less "trail run" and more "ice skating audition."
  *   Air quality is sitting at a moderate 84 AQI, with ozone as the main culprit. It's not "stay inside and hermetically seal yourself" bad, but if you're sensitive, you might notice it on longer efforts.
  *   No major events or construction blocking routes have been reported in the last 24 hours, which is a win, but don't mistake lack of news for lack of hazards.
</BulletList>

Look, the sun is out, which is a rare enough treat this time of year that I get why you'd want to be outside. But let's be real, this isn't exactly prime running weather. That air is sharp, and the ground is likely to be a mixed bag of packed snow, frozen mud, and slick ice, especially in shaded areas or on less-travelled paths.

### Weather & Ground Conditions

The mercury is firmly in the negatives at -11.4°C. While it's clear, that just means more opportunity for sunshine to lull you into a false sense of security about how cold it actually is. Any exposed skin is going to feel it, fast. Frostbite isn't a joke, especially on fingers, toes, and ears.

As for the ground, expect the worst. What might look like firm, packed snow can hide a patch of black ice just waiting to send you to the ER with a fractured wrist. Your ankles are going to be working overtime stabilizing on uneven, frozen terrain. If you're heading out towards places like LC Gunn Park with its varied elevation, you better be wearing some serious trail shoes with good grip – I'm talking microspikes or at least some aggressive lugs. Trust me, a twisted ankle on a quiet section of trail when it's this cold is a special kind of misery.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Icy Pavement & Trails:** Be extremely cautious. Shaded areas and less-trafficked paths, especially around the Cranbrook Hill Greenway, are likely treacherous. Assume every damp-looking patch is black ice. Use appropriate footwear with aggressive tread or consider microspikes.

### Air Quality & Pollen Rundown

The Air Quality Index is at 84, which is in the moderate category. The dominant pollutant is ozone. For most healthy individuals, this isn't going to cause major issues on a moderate workout. However, if you've got asthma or other respiratory conditions, you might want to consider keeping your intensity down or shortening your run. You shouldn't be pushing for PBs when your lungs are already working a bit harder than usual.

| Pollutant Category | AQI Range | Prince George Today |
| :----------------- | :-------- | :------------------ |
| Good               | 0-50      |                     |
| Moderate           | 51-100    | X                   |
| Unhealthy for S.G. | 101-150   |                     |
| Unhealthy          | 151-200   |                     |
| Very Unhealthy     | 201-300   |                     |
| Hazardous          | 301-500   |                     |

Good news on the pollen front – it's still blissfully low. Allergies aren't going to be holding you back today.

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Layer Up, Seriously:** This isn't a brisk autumn day. We're talking base layers, mid-layers, windproof outer shells. Don't forget a good hat, gloves (or mitts!), and a neck gaiter. You can always shed a layer if you overheat, but you can't conjure one out of thin air if you're freezing. Hypothermia is no joke.
</AlertBox>

Overall, if you absolutely *must* get out, stick to well-maintained, cleared routes if possible, or opt for a treadmill run where the only ice you'll encounter is in your water bottle. And for the love of all that is holy, tell someone where you're going and when you expect to be back.
