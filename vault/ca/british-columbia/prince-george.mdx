Don't even think about a comfortable run outside today.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today is decidedly NOT the day:

<BulletList>
  - **The Wind is a Wrecking Ball:** Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement, and by "special," they mean "hold onto your hats, your dogs, and possibly your small children." We're looking at west winds reaching 50 km/h, gusting up to a brutal 80 km/h before noon. That's not a gentle breeze, folks, that's a direct assault on your balance, your sinuses, and your exposed skin. Running against that is less a workout and more a fight for survival.
  - **Chilly with a Bite:** While the mercury might show a seemingly mild 1.6°C, those 80 km/h gusts will make it feel significantly colder. Wind chill is no joke. Your lungs will be taking a beating trying to warm that frigid air, and your joints will be stiff before you've even hit your stride. Frostbite can happen quicker than you think when the wind rips through your layers.
  - **Ozone's in the Air:** Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 84, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Mix that with high winds stirring up whatever else is floating around, and your respiratory system isn't exactly getting a spa day. While not outright dangerous, it's certainly not doing your lungs any favors, especially when they're already working overtime against the cold wind.
</BulletList>

Look, I get it. We're in Prince George. We're tough. But there's a difference between toughing it out and being genuinely foolish. Today leans heavily towards the latter for any serious outdoor cardio. That wind isn't just unpleasant; it can be dangerous. Think about debris, icy patches being swept up, or simply being blown off your feet. Trying to hit your stride on a trail like the Greenway when you're fighting an invisible wall is a recipe for frustration or, worse, an injury. Save the heroics for race day, not a Thursday with a wind warning.

### Construction and Trail Advisories

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Watch Your Step on Foothills!** There are ongoing traffic and pedestrian disruptions around town. Specifically, the southbound lane and bike lane on **Foothills Boulevard between Cranbrook Hill Road and Ochakwin Crescent** are intermittently closed until July 2026 for construction materials loading and unloading. If Foothills is part of your route, be extra vigilant for construction vehicles and unexpected lane shifts. Don't assume drivers see you when they're navigating active work zones.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Seriously, the Wind!** Gusts up to 80 km/h are no joke. This isn't just about being uncomfortable; it's about real safety. High winds can bring down branches, cause power outages, and make cycling or even steady running precarious. Consider taking your workout indoors today. Your lungs and joints will thank you for not making them battle a gale.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **Layers, Layers, Layers (If You Must Go Out):** If you absolutely cannot resist the call of the great outdoors despite the warnings, dress in windproof and moisture-wicking layers. Pay special attention to covering all exposed skin, especially your ears, nose, and fingers. A good pair of gloves and a wind-resistant balaclava are non-negotiable in these conditions. But honestly, just hit the treadmill.
