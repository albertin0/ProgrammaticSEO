Look, if you're planning a leisurely jog in Prince George today, you might as well strap yourself to a lamppost, because these winds are no joke.

<LungsJointsScore score={4} />

## Why today isn't the day:

<BulletList>
*   **Wind advisory is in full effect, folks.** Environment Canada is forecasting west winds reaching 50 km/h, with gusts absolutely ripping up to 80 km/h today. Trying to run into that is less "workout" and more "human kite experiment."
*   **Temperatures are playing games.** While it's currently a clear 2.6°C, don't be fooled. Snow showers are in the forecast for later today and tonight, and temperatures are expected to drop below freezing, meaning any moisture on the ground could turn slick.
*   **Air quality is just... meh.** Our AQI is sitting at 68, which is "moderate," with ozone being the dominant pollutant. Not ideal for hammering those intervals, especially if you're sensitive.
</BulletList>

### High Wind Hazards on the Trails

Seriously, let's talk about these winds. Gusts up to 80 km/h aren't just annoying; they're genuinely dangerous. If you're out on the more exposed sections of the trails, like the pathways through Lheidli T'enneh Memorial Park along the Nechako River, you're going to get buffeted. Forget your pace goals, just focus on not getting knocked off your feet. Falling branches, flying debris – it's all on the menu when the wind is this angry.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### DANGER: Extreme High Winds
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for Prince George warning of gusts up to 80 km/h. This can make running extremely difficult and dangerous, with risks of falling debris, loss of balance, and increased wind chill. Consider moving your workout indoors.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### WARNING: Potential for Slippery Conditions
While it's currently clear, expect snow showers later today and temperatures dropping to -5°C. This means any wet surfaces could become icy, particularly on shaded paths or bridges. Watch your footing, especially if you insist on hitting those trails.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
### INFO: Moderate Air Quality
The Air Quality Index is currently 68, primarily due to ozone. For most people, this isn't a showstopper, but if you have respiratory issues, you might feel it. Keep your workout intensity in check and listen to your body.

And let's not even get into the city's charming collection of ongoing construction projects. If you're trying to navigate the sidewalks around, say, 6th Avenue between Brunswick and Victoria, remember those are closed until April 30th. Same goes for intermittent bike lane closures on Foothills Boulevard. It's always something.

Honestly, today might be a good day for a cross-training session indoors, or at the very least, a really well-sheltered route where you don't have to fight a gale force wind just to get to the coffee shop. Stay safe, Prince George.
