Alright, Surrey, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the trails today. Honestly, it's a mixed bag, as usual.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

## Why today is/isn't the day:

<BulletList>
  <li>The air quality is officially "Moderate" at 73 AQI with ozone as the dominant jerk, so your lungs might feel it if you're sensitive.</li>
  <li>Construction is, yet again, doing its best to trip you up on major routes and popular multi-use paths.</li>
  <li>Weather is clear and chilly, which is usually a win, but watch those footing hazards!</li>
</BulletList>

## The Air: Breathe Deeply, But Maybe Not *Too* Deeply

Look, the official word is an AQI of 73 with ozone doing its thing. That’s "Moderate," which for most of us means it’s not going to kill you, but if you've got asthma or are just generally a delicate flower, you might feel a bit of irritation. This is where things get weird though. Some local reports are calling today "Low Risk" on the Air Quality Health Index, while others were flagging it as "Poor" for sensitive groups just yesterday. Personally, I'm sticking with "Moderate" because that's what's in front of me, but consider it a yellow flag, not a green light for setting personal bests if you're prone to a cough.

### Today's Pollen Breakdown (What, you thought you'd escape this?)

| Pollen Type | Level   |
| :---------- | :------ |
| General     | Low     |

Low pollen is a win, so at least you won't be snotting all over your running watch.

## On the Ground: Construction is Our Co-Pilot

Now, for the fun part: dodging cones and questionable detours.

### Your Daily Dose of Surrey Road Rage

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Bridgeview Drive is a Mess:** If you were planning on cruising northbound on Bridgeview Drive near Highway 17, forget it. A semi-truck had a little mishap yesterday, closing northbound lanes and causing a "significant fuel and oil spill." Expect ongoing delays and general chaos in that area. Probably not the best place for a long run or a smooth bike ride right now.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
  **Fraser Highway SkyTrain Saga Continues:** That SkyTrain expansion? Yeah, it's still happening. Expect single-lane traffic on Fraser Highway and "changes to bike lanes and multi-use paths". If you regularly run or cycle this corridor, you know the drill – assume your usual route is a construction zone minefield. Be extra vigilant, especially around intersections like 140 Street where lane reductions and turn restrictions are in full swing until 2028.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="danger">
  **Boundary Bay Dyke Trail Detours:** Planning a scenic long run or ride along the Boundary Bay Dyke Trail? Be aware of ongoing construction for dyke upgrades, especially near Mud Bay. There are "trail closures and detours... until September 2025". Yes, 2025. That means it’s still affecting your stride today. Expect to encounter large trucks in one area. If you're out there, pay attention to signage or you might end up in a ditch.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
  **South Surrey Overpass Work:** Heads up, South Surrey crew. Work on the 20 Avenue overpass of Highway 99 is kicking off this month and will run until late 2027. This includes widening 20 Avenue, which is great for future pedestrian and cycling facilities, but for now, it means active construction. Croydon Drive will be closed from 20 Avenue, so plan your routes accordingly.
</AlertBox>

## Final Thoughts:

It's 6.1°C and clear, which is perfect for a brisk run or walk. Just make sure you're keeping an eye out for the construction zones that seem to pop up faster than weeds in my backyard. Stick to paths you know, or be prepared for some unexpected detours, especially around the Fraser Highway corridor or down by the Boundary Bay Dyke Trail.
