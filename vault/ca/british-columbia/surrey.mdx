Look, if you're itching to get out there in Surrey today, February 26th, 2026, you *can*, but don't expect it to be perfectly smooth sailing.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>
  <li>**Air's a bit hazy:** That AQI is sitting at 76 with ozone dominating. For us regular folks, it means if you start hacking up a lung or your throat feels like sandpaper, maybe dial it back. If you're an "at-risk" individual, you already know the drill – listen to your body.</li>
  <li>**SkyTrain chaos continues:** The Surrey Langley SkyTrain project is still a beast, chewing up Fraser Highway. Expect lane closures and detours for pedestrians and cyclists, especially around areas like the multi-use path closure from 168 Street to Highway 15. Don't plan on hitting any speed records through there without dodging some barriers.</li>
  <li>**Wet and slushy higher up:** A low-pressure system is making its way through, bringing a mix of rain and snow into tonight. While Surrey proper will mostly see rain, if you're thinking of tackling any routes that climb a bit, like up towards the northern edges of Tynehead Regional Park, expect some slush or light snow accumulating above 300-400 meters. Tread carefully.</li>

## Today's Outdoor Reality Check

Alright, Surrey runners, let's cut to the chase. It's February 26, 2026, and the conditions are, well, *fine* if you're not expecting perfection. We've got clear skies right now at 9.1°C, which is practically tropical for late February around here. However, don't let that fool you into thinking it's a walk in the park.

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is clocking in at 76, with Ozone being the main culprit. Now, for most of us iron-lunged warriors, that's just a bit of a nuisance. But here's the deal: this falls into the "moderate risk" category.

<AlertBox type="warning">
  If you've got any underlying respiratory issues, or if you start feeling any irritation in your throat or a persistent cough, consider shortening your run or taking it indoors. No personal best is worth an asthma attack. For the rest of us, if you feel any symptoms, slow down or stop.
</AlertBox>

### Construction: Welcome to the Gauntlet

The never-ending saga of the Surrey Langley SkyTrain construction continues to dominate. Fraser Highway is still a patchwork of detours and reduced lanes for vehicles, but more importantly for us, expect pedestrian and cyclist diversions. They've even got a multi-use path closure from 168 Street to Highway 15. This means your usual flow is probably busted, especially if you're trying to get a continuous long run in that area.

<AlertBox type="danger">
  Seriously, watch your step. Construction zones are unpredictable. Expect uneven surfaces, sudden detours, and heavy machinery noise. If you're usually zoning out on your runs, today is not the day for it, particularly along the Fraser Highway corridor.
</AlertBox>

Then there's the Pattullo Bridge replacement. While the old bridge is now permanently closed to vehicle traffic, its sidewalk was still open for pedestrians and cyclists until February 17th. After that, you're on the new stal̕əw̓asəm Bridge. Just be aware that things are in flux around there, with local closures on Columbia Street in New West starting today for a month or two. Always better to assume there's a barrier where you least expect it.

### Weather: A Little Dampness Never Hurt Anyone (Unless It's Ice)

Current temps are hovering around a respectable 9.1°C and it's clear right now. However, a low-pressure system is rolling in, bringing some heavier precipitation this afternoon and into tonight. We're looking at a rain/snow mix over Metro Vancouver. In Surrey proper, you'll likely just get wet. But if you were planning on a hill workout in the higher elevations, say, exploring some of the trails around the Port Kells area that get a bit more vertical, be aware that snow levels could drop to 300-400 meters, with a few centimeters of accumulation possible.

<AlertBox type="info">
  If you're hitting those higher-elevation trails, consider switching to trail shoes for better grip on potentially slushy or slippery surfaces. And maybe bring a waterproof jacket that actually *works*.
</AlertBox>

Pollen counts are low today, which is excellent news for anyone usually sniffing and sneezing their way through a spring run. So at least there's that.

All in all, today is a mixed bag. The air's a bit meh, the construction is a pain in the ass, but the temperature is decent and pollen is low. Just be smart, stay aware, and don't take any unnecessary risks.
