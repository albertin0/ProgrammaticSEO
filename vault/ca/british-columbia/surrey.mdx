Alright, let's cut to the chase: Today's a "proceed with caution" kind of day for pounding the pavement or hitting the trails here in Surrey.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is hitting a moderate 78, with ozone being the main culprit. It's not "stay indoors and hermetically seal yourself" bad, but if your lungs are finicky, you might feel it.
*   Construction, as always, is king. The Surrey-Langley SkyTrain project is still chugging along, meaning sections of **Fraser Highway** are a mess of roadworks, utility relocation, and potential pile driving. Expect detours and uneven surfaces.
*   On the bright side, the air is clear, and 4.3°C is actually quite pleasant for a run if you dress smart. The cold isn't trying to actively kill you for once.

### Air Quality: Don't Breathe Too Deeply

So, your phone might be telling you the air's fine, but the data says otherwise with an AQI of 78, primarily due to ozone. For those of us with lungs that aren't factory-fresh, or if you're planning a particularly intense session, this is your body telling you to ease up. Ozone can be a real lung irritant, causing coughing, throat irritation, and shortness of breath. You might not see it, but it's there, silently messing with your workout.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Moderate Air Quality Alert:** An AQI of 78 (Ozone) means sensitive individuals (asthmatics, elderly, children) should consider reducing strenuous outdoor activities. The rest of us? Take it down a notch if you feel any symptoms.

| Pollen Type | Level |
| :---------- | :---- |
| Overall     | Low   |

Good news for the sniffly runners out there: pollen levels are sitting pretty at "Low." So at least your allergies won't be joining the ozone in a tag-team assault on your respiratory system.

### Construction Chaos: Mind the Gap (and the Debris)

Surrey is perpetually under construction, and this week is no different. The **Surrey-Langley SkyTrain** extension is a major player, with ongoing work affecting huge stretches of the Fraser Highway corridor. We're talking road widening, foundation work, utility moving – basically, anything that makes for a terrible running or cycling surface. Expect changes to traffic patterns, and yes, that includes the pedestrian and cycling routes too. This isn't just about inconvenience; it's about actual physical hazards. Those temporary sidewalks can be uneven, and drivers are often distracted by the detours, making crossing streets more dicey.

Then there's the **72 Avenue Corridor Project**, widening 72 Avenue between 188 Street and 196 Street. More lanes mean more speed, and more construction means more dust and potential sudden changes in your route. If you usually run or bike these routes, you'll need to be extra vigilant or find an alternative.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Major Construction Hazards:** Significant road and infrastructure work is ongoing along Fraser Highway and 72 Avenue. Expect detours, uneven surfaces, heavy machinery, and increased traffic caution. Plan your route carefully or choose alternative trails.

**Pro Tip:** If you're determined to hit the roads, check the City of Surrey's website for real-time traffic and construction updates, especially around major projects like the SkyTrain. A little planning can save you a lot of headache (or a twisted ankle).

It's 4.3°C and clear, which is prime running weather for those who don't melt at the sight of a cloud. Just dress in layers, maybe a light jacket, and you'll be golden, provided your lungs can handle the ozone and your feet can dodge the rebar.

*Data grounded with CTV News, Environment Canada, BC Parks, and Remi Network from February 27-28, 2026.*
