Alright, Victoria, step outside and get after it, but keep an eye on your map and maybe plan a slight detour.

## Why today is/isn't the day

<BulletList>
*   That infamous section of the **Galloping Goose Regional Trail** between Cecelia Road and Viaduct Park? Yeah, it's still closed thanks to slope instability. Don't be "that person" trying to squeeze through; you'll be rerouting if that's your usual route.
*   Air quality is sitting at a "moderate" 68 AQI due to ozone. For most of us, that's fine, but if you're prone to lung irritation, you might feel it, especially as the day goes on. Good news, though: pollen is practically non-existent.
*   While the 7.3°C and clear skies are pretty choice, construction is a real buzzkill. Factor in potential delays if you're driving to your starting point, especially around the Island Highway in View Royal. And heads up, a full closure on Cedar Hill Road is slated to kick off March 2nd for culvert repair near PKOLS (Mount Douglas Park), so pre-plan your runs and rides for next week.
</BulletList>

Today's not a bad day for a run or ride, but it's not without its urban obstacles. The air is decent enough for most, and the temperature is mild, which is a blessing in February. Just make sure you know your route, especially if you usually rely on the **Galloping Goose**. That trail closure isn't new, but it's ongoing, forcing a scenic detour if you're heading downtown or beyond.

Speaking of detours and annoyances, the City of Victoria is doing some much-needed upgrades, including replacing three public washrooms along the popular **Dallas Road** waterfront walkway. While the actual construction might not start immediately today, it means future runs along that iconic stretch will have some temporary disruptions. For now, enjoy the fresh, clear air down by the ocean, but don't be surprised if you see some cones going up "soon to later this year."

**Roadwork Round-Up:** If you're driving to a trailhead, be aware of B.C. Hydro work causing eastbound lane closures on the Island Highway through View Royal until March 6. Also, a full road closure on Cedar Hill Road between Churchill Drive and Ash Road starts March 2nd. Plan ahead!
