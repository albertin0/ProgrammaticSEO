Alright, Victoria, step outside and get after it, but keep those eyes peeled for detours. It’s a pretty decent day if you know where you’re going.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  *   **Air's Alright, But Not Perfect:** Our AQI is sitting at a "moderate" 69, with ozone as the dominant pollutant. It’s not wildfire season smoke, which is a win, but if you're sensitive, you might feel it.
  *   **Pollen? What Pollen?:** Blessedly low pollen counts mean your nose won't be running a marathon of its own. Enjoy that clear breathing.
  *   **Trail Treachery:** The Galloping Goose, bless its heart, is a minefield of closures and delays right now. Don't just head out hoping for the best.

## Today's Outdoor Rundown

The sun's out, the temperature is a comfortable 9.1°C, and there isn't a cloud in sight. This is prime running weather for our coastal city. You can actually see the Olympic Mountains across the Strait today – a rare treat sometimes!

However, it's not all smooth sailing. The air quality, while not *bad*, isn't sparkling either. We're at a moderate AQI of 69, with ozone being the main culprit. For most of us, this means "go for it," but if you've got asthma or are just generally sensitive to air changes, consider a slightly less intense pace or stick to earlier in the day when ozone levels tend to be lower.

### Trail Updates: The Galloping Goose, a Series of Obstacles

If your usual route involves the **Galloping Goose Regional Trail**, you need to pay serious attention. There are multiple, ongoing issues that will force detours or outright block your path.

<AlertBox type="danger">
The Galloping Goose Regional Trail is currently CLOSED between Cecelia Road and Viaduct Park due to potential slope instability. This isn't a suggestion; it's a hard closure for your safety. You will be rerouted.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="warning">
Expect temporary delays on various sections of the Galloping Goose between February 23 and 27 (today!) from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. due to tree removal. Factor in extra time and be ready to slow down or wait for crews.
</AlertBox>

Another stretch of the Goose in Colwood is also closed between Wale Road and Belmont Bridge. And just a heads up for next week, the Goose west of Six Mile in View Royal will be closing from March 2 for a bridge replacement. If the Goose is your go-to, check the CRD Parks website before you lace up, because things are changing fast out there. Same goes for the E&N Trail, which will be closed between Admirals Road and Stancombe Place on March 2.

If you're looking for an uninterrupted, clear run with some fresh sea air, your best bet might be to stick to the well-maintained paths along **Dallas Road** or consider routes further afield that haven't been impacted by the various works.

### Road Construction & Downtown Activity

Beyond the trails, we've got a fair bit of road construction. The eastbound lane of Island Highway in View Royal (200-block between Stewart Ave and Plowright Rd) is closed for BC Hydro work until March 6. And yes, that notorious BC Hydro project continues to impact Douglas Street (Topaz Avenue to Burnside Road) and Burnside Road itself with lane closures and a full closure, respectively. While these are primarily traffic headaches, remember that reduced lanes mean less space for pedestrians and cyclists, so exercise extra caution.

<AlertBox type="info">
The "Victoria at Dusk" festival is happening downtown this evening from 5 PM to 9 PM in areas like Ship Point, Bastion Square, and Government Street. If you're running or walking downtown, expect more pedestrian traffic and perhaps some light installations to navigate.
</AlertBox>

No crazy wind warnings or extreme cold for Greater Victoria today, so that's a plus. Just typical February clear skies, with some urban and trail-side obstacles to keep things interesting.
