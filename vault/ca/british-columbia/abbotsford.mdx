If you're heading out for a run in Abbotsford today, February 28, 2026, it's a "layer up and mind your surroundings" kind of day.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The air quality sits at a moderate 72 AQI, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. For some of us, that's enough to feel it in the lungs, so don't push your intervals too hard.
*   Temperatures are hovering around 4.4°C and it's clear out, meaning chilly beginnings but no immediate precipitation to deal with. Bundle up, especially if you're hitting the trails early.
*   Pollen is low, which is a small win for those of us who usually sniffle our way through spring.

## The Rundown on Your Run

You want the good news first? The low pollen count means your sinuses might actually thank you for getting outside today. However, the air quality isn't exactly pristine. An AQI of 72, with ozone as the primary culprit, lands us squarely in "moderate" territory. While not a red-alert, it's enough to advise anyone with respiratory sensitivities to take it easy. Don't be a hero. Listen to your body, especially if you're prone to a cough when the air isn't perfectly crisp.

As for the weather, 4.4°C is brisk, but the clear skies are a welcome sight after the usual coastal gloom. Just remember, clear skies in February in Abbotsford mean it'll feel colder than the thermometer reads, especially with any residual dampness in the air. Dress in layers you can shed as you warm up, starting with a good base layer. Gloves and a hat might be overkill after the first K, but you'll thank yourself for having them for the initial chill.

## Local Trail Talk

Now, for the persistent headaches that are our local trails. If your usual route takes you through **Mill Lake Park**, be aware that portions are still under reconstruction and widening. The City of Abbotsford is working on upgrading the Lake Loop pathway to make it safer and more accessible, which is great for the future, but currently means detours and potential interruptions. Please respect the signage and stay out of marked construction zones. I know we all love to find our own way, but trust me, a fall in a muddy construction site isn't worth shaving a minute off your run.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Mill Lake Park Pathway Widening is ongoing.** Expect detours and partial closures around the Lake Loop trail. Seriously, just follow the signs.
</AlertBox>

Beyond Mill Lake, some sections of Ravine Park are still dealing with flood damage from earlier winter rainstorms and remain closed. It's always a good idea to check the City of Abbotsford's website for the latest trail status before you head out, especially if you're planning an off-road adventure. Also, while not directly impacting your run today, there's ongoing discussion about the future of trails in the McKee Peak area on Sumas Mountain due to planned development. This isn't an immediate hazard, but something to keep an eye on for long-term route planning.

<AlertBox type="info">
Remember, even on a clear day, trails can be slick from residual moisture. Watch your footing, especially if you're hitting any unpaved sections.
</AlertBox>

In short, today is a decent day for a workout if you're prepared for the cool air and willing to navigate some minor detours. Just don't expect perfectly clean air or an uninterrupted run around Mill Lake.
