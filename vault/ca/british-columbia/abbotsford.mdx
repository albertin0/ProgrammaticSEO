Alright, Abbotsford, today's one of those days where you really gotta pick your poison for an outdoor sweat session.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
  *   The air quality is officially "moderate" with ozone being the main culprit, so if your lungs are finicky, take it easy.
  *   We're looking at some respectable winds gusting up to 40 km/h today, which means your run might feel like a constant uphill battle against an invisible force.
  *   Trail closures are still a thing, forcing you onto less forgiving surfaces or making you re-route entirely.

## Abbotsford Outdoor Workout Guide: February 26, 2026

So, the sun's out, the temperature is a reasonable 6.6°C, and you're itching to get outside. Don't just blindly hit the pavement, folks. While the weather *looks* inviting, there are a few snags in the Abbotsford outdoor workout fabric today that you need to be aware of.

First off, let's talk about the air. Our Air Quality Index is sitting at a moderate 73, with ozone dominating the pollutants. This isn't "stay indoors and hermetically seal your windows" bad, but it's not ideal for all-out efforts, especially if you've got asthma or other respiratory sensitivities. Keep an eye on how you feel. If your chest starts to feel tight or you're coughing more than usual, dial it back. The low pollen count is a silver lining for allergy sufferers, at least.

Then there's the wind. Environment Canada was calling for southwest winds gusting up to 40 km/h today. That might not sound like much when you're bundled up for a quick walk, but try running into that for a few kilometres. It'll make an easy pace feel like a tempo run and can really chill you to the bone if you're not layered properly. Remember, that wind chill factor is real.

### Watch Out for Gusty Winds
Expect winds gusting up to 40 km/h today. This can make runs feel tougher and increase the perceived cold. Layer up, consider a route that offers some windbreak, and be mindful of debris.

Now, for those of you who prefer the dirt to the asphalt, listen up. Our trails are still a bit of a patchwork, thanks to ongoing maintenance and some lingering damage from previous weather events. Portions of **Mill Lake Park** are still undergoing reconstruction and widening, so expect detours and closed sections. Seriously, don't ignore those "Closed" signs; they're there for a reason, usually involving heavy machinery or unstable ground. McKay Creek Trail is also seeing intermittent closures today south of the trail bridge for maintenance, so if that's your usual loop, be prepared to adjust. And let's not forget Ravine Park, which still has sections closed from last winter's flood damage. Stick to the open areas and respect the barriers.

### Plan Your Route Strategically
With several trail sections closed at Mill Lake Park, and intermittent closures on McKay Creek Trail, check the City of Abbotsford's trail updates before heading out. Consider sticking to open paved pathways or even a good old-fashioned track workout if you're not keen on navigating detours.
</AlertBox>

On the roads, there are a scattering of minor lane and shoulder closures for transit shelter installations and landscaping on streets like Townline Road, Cardinal Road, and Mt. Lehman Road. Nothing major that should derail your whole plan, but be aware if your usual route involves these spots. Always look out for construction crews and give them space.

The bottom line? You can absolutely get a decent workout in today, but it requires a bit of planning and common sense. A moderate AQI, blustery winds, and fragmented trail access mean you might need to adjust your expectations or your usual routine. Don't be a hero; listen to your body and respect the conditions.
