Alright, Abbotsford, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the dirt today. If you're looking for a perfect, hazard-free run, you're probably dreaming, but today isn't half bad if you know where to look.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI is sitting at a "Moderate" 72 with ozone as the dominant pollutant. For most of you weekend warriors, it's probably fine. But if you're got dodgy lungs, maybe stick to some indoor drills or at least don't push the pace too hard. Your airways will thank you.
*   Pollen is low, so at least your sneezes won't be echoing across Mill Lake Park. That's a win.
*   We've got clear skies and a chilly 5.6°C, which is fantastic for running—crisp air, no rain to deal with, no oppressive heat. Layer up, obviously, but enjoy the sunshine while it lasts.
</BulletList>

### Abbotsford Trail & Road Report

Look, the City's always "improving" things, which usually means "digging things up and closing them." Today is no exception.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Mill Lake Park** has ongoing trail reconstruction and widening. Don't be that person ignoring the detour signs. It's for your safety, and frankly, you're just annoying the construction crew.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
Good news for Discovery Trail regulars: the section from Horn Street to Valley Road, including the boardwalks, is open. Just remember, "improvements continue through 2025 and 2026", so keep an eye out for future disruptions. It's Abbotsford, there's always *some* kind of project going on.
</AlertBox>

**Matsqui Trail Regional Park** still has that permanent closure at the at-grade rail crossing; you've got to use the new route under the railway. Honestly, it's safer, so get over it.

If you're driving to your workout spot, be aware of ongoing road closures. Today, specifically, there's a single lane closure for landscaping at the Mt. Lehman Road Roundabout and South Fraser Way until end-of-day. Also, that south-bound bike lane on Townline Road between Ridgeview Drive and Upper Maclure Road is closed for transit shelter installation until today. Plan your cycle routes accordingly or just enjoy the extra challenge of dodging traffic cones.

Further out, **Ravine Park** has sections closed due to flood damage. Best to avoid it for now unless you fancy a swim-run hybrid, which, let's be real, you don't.

And speaking of projects, Highway 1 is basically a permanent construction zone. They're doing expansion and reconstruction between Clearbrook Road and McCallum Road, with tenders expiring today. Expect this to impact traffic for years, with completion dates pushed out to 2029 for some sections. So, if your commute involves the highway, brace yourself for the usual Fraser Valley crawl.

### Final Thoughts

Today's a decent day for a run or outdoor activity if you navigate the construction zones and don't have super sensitive lungs. The clear, cool weather is a gift, so take advantage of it. Just pick your route wisely to avoid getting stuck in a detour or breathing too much ozone.
