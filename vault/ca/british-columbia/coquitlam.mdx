Alright Coquitlam, it's Thursday, February 26th, and if you're planning on getting out there, just know it's a mixed bag of 'meh' and 'watch your step.'

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Moderate Air Quality:** That AQI is nudging into the orange zone, folks. With Ozone as the main culprit, anyone with lung issues or planning a heavy session should probably take it easy or hit the treadmill.
*   **Construction Chaos Continues:** You can't swing a dead cat in this city without hitting a construction zone. Expect traffic headaches and trail detours around the Coquitlam River Bridge and especially near Eagle Mountain Park.
*   **Cool, Clear, But Potentially Slick:** The temperature is a crisp 5.2°C and it's clear out, which is decent. Just remember that overnight moisture can still make those shaded paths and wooden bridges slicker than a politician's promise.

## The Rundown: Don't Be a Hero

Look, I get it. We're runners. We want to hit the pavement, or more often, the trails. But today requires a bit more brainpower than usual. The air quality at 73 AQI, with ozone dominant, means your lungs are working harder to filter that crud. If you're hammering out intervals or going for a long run, you're inhaling more of it. Scale it back. Don't be that person wheezing through Mundy Park because you ignored the numbers.

### Construction Zone Navigation

If your route takes you anywhere near the **Coquitlam River Bridge** on Highway 7B, you're going to contend with ongoing upgrade work. They've got reduced lane widths and a 40 km/h speed limit, which means drivers are probably a little more agitated than usual. Pedestrian access is being maintained, but be smart and make eye contact with drivers. Don't assume they see you.

And for our trail fanatics, the **FortisBC Eagle Mountain - Woodfibre Gas Pipeline Project** is still chugging along. This means intermittent closures on trails within the **Eagle Mountain Park** area, including the infamous Lungbusters. Seriously, check local signage before you head out, or you'll be turning around grumpy, adding unnecessary mileage to your "warm-up." Nobody wants that.

**Trail Closures in Eagle Mountain Park!** The FortisBC pipeline project means certain trails, like Lungbusters, will be closed intermittently. Always check for posted signs at trailheads.

Roadwork is also continuing on **Pipeline Road** (especially north of Dayanee Springs Boulevard/El Casa Court) and sections of **Dewdney Trunk Road**. While this mostly impacts drivers, if you're a road cyclist or running on shoulders, be extra cautious of lane shifts, equipment, and pedestrian detours.

### What to Wear & Hydrate

With the mercury at 5.2°C, layers are your friend. Think wicking base layer, a light mid-layer, and a wind-resistant shell. Gloves are probably a good idea, and a toque or headband can make a huge difference. While the air is clear, that moderate AQI with ozone means staying hydrated is even more important to help your body process pollutants. Guzzle that water.

**AQI Reminder:** An AQI of 73 is "Moderate." If you're sensitive to air pollution (asthma, COPD), or just feel unusually breathless, consider an indoor workout today. Listen to your body, it's not lying to you.
</AlertBox>

All in all, today's not a write-off, but it's not a "run wild and free" day either. Be smart, stay aware of your surroundings, and don't push it too hard with that moderate air quality.
