Today's a mixed bag, Coquitlam. You can get outside, but keep your eyes peeled and your lungs in check.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   **Air Quality is Meh:** AQI is sitting at 87 with ozone as the main culprit. That's moderate, so if you've got sensitive lungs, maybe dial back the intensity or stick to an indoor session.
*   **Construction Chaos:** Seriously, Coquitlam seems to be one giant construction zone lately. Expect detours, reduced lanes, and general headaches around several major routes.
*   **Chilly but Clear:** At 3.8°C and clear skies, it's perfect weather for a brisk run or walk, just dress in layers.

## Coquitlam's Outdoor Rundown: February 28, 2026

Alright, fellow Coquitlam pavement pounders and trail blazers, let's talk about hitting the streets and trails today. The good news? The skies are clear, and while it's a bit nippy at 3.8°C, it beats rain or snow. Layer up, and you'll be fine.

The not-so-great news, especially for your lungs, is that the Air Quality Index (AQI) is sitting at a moderate 87, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. If you're usually bothered by moderate air quality, consider an easier route or maybe even an indoor workout. Don't push it. Your lungs will thank you.

Pollen levels are blissfully low today, so at least you won't be snotting your way through your workout if allergies usually get to you.

### Construction: The Eternal Coquitlam Obstacle Course

Now, let's address the elephant in the room – or rather, the excavator on the road. Construction is a constant in our city, and today is no exception.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up on Pipeline Road!** The Pipeline Road Upgrade project is still ongoing. Expect single-lane alternating traffic and occasional pedestrian detours between Guildford Way and Gabriola Drive. This work happens weekdays from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. If your usual route takes you through here, plan for delays or find an alternate path. Watch for workers and equipment.
</AlertBox>

The Mariner Way Overpass is also getting upgrades, though that's mostly night work (9 p.m. to 6 a.m.) starting early March. Still, if you're an early bird runner, be aware that sidewalks might be closed in certain phases of the project.

Then there's the ongoing Dewdney Trunk Road Water Main project between Lougheed Highway and Mariner Way, which is limiting traffic to a single lane in each direction until April. If you're trying to walk or run along Dewdney, prepare for tight spaces and keep your wits about you.

And, of course, the Coquitlam River Bridge Upgrade project is still underway, with Stage 1 continuing through spring 2026. You'll find reduced speed limits (40 km/h) in the construction zone, and while pedestrian access is maintained, it might involve temporary pathways. Keep your head on a swivel here.

| Environmental Factor | Current Reading | Notes                     |
| :------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------ |
| Temperature          | 3.8°C (Clear)   | Cool, dress in layers     |
| AQI                  | 87 (Moderate)   | Dominant Pollutant: Ozone |
| Pollen               | Low             | Good for allergy sufferers |

No major trail closures due to recent weather or events are reported for Coquitlam today. We saw some in Port Coquitlam back in December due to heavy rain, so it's always smart to avoid unstable riverbanks if you're near water, even on clear days.

In short: it's runnable, but mind the air, and definitely mind the road crews. Don't be that runner who gets honked at because you're oblivious to traffic or a sudden detour.
