Today's a decent day to get outside, but don't expect smooth sailing everywhere in Coquitlam.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   That AQI reading of 76 means we've got moderate ozone pollution hanging around. If your lungs are sensitive, dial back the intensity, especially later in the day when ozone tends to peak.
*   Seriously, Coquitlam's a construction zone. Expect detours, single-lane alternating traffic, and general chaos on major routes like Pipeline Road and Dewdney Trunk Road. These aren't just car problems; they impact pedestrians and cyclists too.
*   On the upside, the weather's clear and a mild 7.9°C. That's a welcome reprieve from the usual February gray. Enjoy it while it lasts.

## The Rundown: What to Watch Out For

Let's be blunt: the air quality isn't exactly crisp. With an AQI of 76 and ozone as the dominant pollutant, some folks might feel it more than others. Keep an eye on how you feel. It's not "stay indoors and board up the windows" bad, but it's not "take a deep, refreshing breath of mountain air" good either.

### Construction Chaos: Mind Your Route

If you're planning a run or ride that involves Pipeline Road, prepare for disruptions. There's ongoing underground storm main work north of Dayanee Springs Boulevard/El Casa Court that's causing 24/7 single-lane alternating traffic, and it's set to continue for about a month. The broader Pipeline Road Upgrade project between Guildford Way and Gabriola Drive is also chugging along, meaning more alternating traffic and occasional pedestrian detours on weekdays and Saturdays. Basically, don't zone out on your run; you might literally run into a detour sign.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Heads Up for Trail Runners near Eagle Mountain Park:** The FortisBC Eagle Mountain - Woodfibre Gas Pipeline Project is still underway, and that means trails in the Eagle Mountain Park area, *including Lungbusters*, are subject to intermittent closures. Always check for posted signs at trailheads before you commit to a long haul up there. Nothing kills a good long run like hitting a "TRAIL CLOSED" sign halfway through.

The Coquitlam River Bridge upgrade project is also still doing its thing with daytime work and reduced lane widths. While they've got pedestrian bypass areas, the reduced speed limits and active construction can still make for a less-than-pleasant experience if you're trying to flow with traffic. And let's not forget the Dewdney Trunk Road water main replacement, which is limiting traffic to a single lane in each direction between Lougheed Highway and Mariner Way until April. If you bike or walk that stretch, be extra cautious.

### Events & Weather

No major events are blocking major workout routes today, which is a small victory. The Coquitlam Crunch Challenge isn't until later in the year, so the Crunch Trail should be clear for your masochistic enjoyment. There's a "Drop-In Nature Sketching" event at Coquitlam Heritage at Mackin House this evening, but that's hardly going to impact your outdoor workout plans.

**Keep an Eye Out for Residual Dampness:** While today's clear, Coquitlam in February can be wet. Even without active rain, some trails, especially those lower down or shaded, might still be muddy or slippery from recent precipitation. Watch your footing, particularly on uneven terrain.
</AlertBox>

Overall, it's a "choose your adventure carefully" kind of day. The clear skies are inviting, but the widespread construction and moderate air quality mean you need to be smart about where and how you push it.
