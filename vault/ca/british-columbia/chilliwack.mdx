Don't let those clear skies fool you, Chilliwack; today's a day to respect the wind before you hit those trails.

<LungsJointsScore score={5} />

<BulletList>

*   **Gusty AF:** Forget your personal best, Environment Canada has issued wind warnings for the Fraser Canyon, with gusts expected to hit 90-100 km/h. Even the Coquihalla is looking at 80 km/h gusts. If you're out running, cycling, or just walking on any exposed section of the Vedder River Rotary Trail, you're going to feel it, and it could be dangerous.
*   **Moderate Air, But Ozone is Lurking:** Your AQI is sitting at a moderate 68, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. It’s not a full-on "stay inside and bubble wrap your lungs" day, but if you've got any respiratory sensitivities, that ozone can be a real pain.
*   **Pollen's Taking a Break:** Good news for allergy sufferers: pollen levels are currently low. Enjoy not sneezing your way through your workout, at least on that front.

</BulletList>

Let's be real, the thought of clear skies and 6.3°C might tempt you to lace up and hit the pavement or the dirt. And sure, the temperature is decent, and the low pollen count is a win for anyone who usually gets sidelined by seasonal sniffles. But what good is clear air if you're getting blown into a ditch, or worse, taking a tree branch to the head?

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Wind Hazard: Stay Clear of Exposed Areas!
Seriously, those wind warnings aren't just for truckers on Highway 1. Gusts up to 100 km/h are no joke. Trees can drop limbs without warning, and even a solid stride can be thrown off balance by a sudden blast of wind. Think twice before heading out to exposed sections of the Vedder River Rotary Trail or any higher elevation spots in the Chilliwack Natural Resource District. Today is NOT the day for a leisurely run near any large, old growth.

While the Fraser Valley isn't currently under any major flood warnings as of today, we've seen enough atmospheric rivers and their aftermath recently to know better than to get complacent. Back in January, parts of Electoral Area E and trails along the Chilliwack River were under evacuation alerts due to high river flows and potential erosion. Even though many local trails, including parts of the Great Blue Heron Nature Reserve, reopened after December's deluge, residual damage and unstable banks can linger. Always check local updates before venturing near riverbanks or low-lying trails.

### AQI is "Meh": Listen to Your Lungs
With the AQI at 68 and ozone as the main culprit, it’s not an ideal day for an all-out effort, especially if you have sensitive airways. "Moderate" air quality means there's enough stuff floating around to potentially irritate your respiratory system. Take it easy, skip the sprint intervals, and stick to a moderate pace. Your lungs will thank you.

On the bright side, construction isn't a direct *workout* hazard unless you're trying to run a marathon on Prest Road (which, let's be honest, would be a workout in itself given its current state). However, road paving for 2026 is kicking off earlier than usual on routes like McMillan, Mercer, Valleyview, and Vedder Roads. If your run takes you along any of these, expect delays and single-lane alternating traffic. Keep an eye on DriveBC if you're venturing further afield on Forest Service Roads (FSRs), as places like Jones Lake FSR and Spuzzum FSR have ongoing maintenance, drilling, and even closures.

### Plan Ahead & Stay Aware
If you absolutely must get outside, stick to sheltered routes. Tell someone where you're going and when you expect to be back. Dress in layers to combat the wind chill, and keep an eye on those ever-present hazards that pop up after a good old BC winter.
