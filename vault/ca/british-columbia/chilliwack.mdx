Today's not the worst day to get out there, but you'll definitely need to plan your route carefully if you want to avoid a frustrating detour.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>

*   The air quality is sitting at a moderate 68 AQI, with ozone being the dominant pollutant. It's not *bad*, but it's not pristine mountain air either, especially if you're pushing hard.
*   Major headaches for anyone planning to cross the Duck Meadows Bridge today; it's completely shut down for maintenance until 4 PM, and there's no detour.
*   Spring construction and trail work are starting to pick up across Chilliwack, meaning more localized delays and closures are on the horizon.

## The Lowdown: Chilliwack Outdoor Conditions for February 26, 2026

Alright, Chilliwack, let's talk about hitting the trails or pounding the pavement today. The good news is the sky is clear, and at 4.6°C, it's cool but perfectly manageable for an outdoor session. The pollen count is mercifully low, so your sinuses can probably chill out for once.

<AlertBox type="warning">
### Moderate Air Quality Alert
Don't let the clear skies fool you; our Air Quality Index is currently at 68, with ozone being the main culprit. If you're particularly sensitive or planning an intense, long-duration workout, consider scaling back or sticking to lighter activity. Keep an eye on how you're feeling, especially around areas with more vehicle traffic.

### Local Hazards & What to Watch For

Here's where it gets a bit more annoying. If your route involves the **Duck Meadows Bridge**, cancel those plans. It's completely closed for maintenance until 4:00 PM today, Thursday, February 26, and there isn't a detour. You'll have to find another way around, which, let's be honest, can add some serious mileage to a run you weren't expecting.

<AlertBox type="danger">
### Bridge Closure: Duck Meadows Bridge
The Duck Meadows Bridge is *closed* until 4 PM PST today for maintenance. There is no detour available. Plan alternate routes if this impacts your commute or workout path.
</AlertBox>

Beyond that immediate headache, the city's gearing up for more construction. The 2026 paving program could be starting earlier than usual, with McMillan, Mercer, Valleyview, and Vedder Roads flagged for early work. Expect single-lane alternating traffic and potential delays if your usual running routes take you near these areas. The Knight Road multi-use pathway project in Sardis is also slated for substantial completion by March, so while it's intended to improve connectivity to the Valley Rail Trail and Chilliwack River Road, there might still be some finishing touches causing minor disruptions.

And for you trail runners, some lingering issues from past weather events persist. While most trails reopened in mid-January after the December flooding, the upper portion of the Qoqó:Lem Trail and the Tower Trail within the Great Blue Heron Nature Reserve are still closed due to dangerous trees. Furthermore, BC Parks is starting rock scaling and trail clean-up work tomorrow (February 27th) through March 31st. While not immediate for *today*, keep an eye on BC Parks advisories, especially if you're heading to trails like those around Bridal Veil Falls Provincial Park, as closures for safety are likely. The Stewart Road East parking lot is also closed for construction until May 1st, so if that's your usual starting point for accessing local trails, find an alternative.

My advice? Double-check DriveBC and local park websites before you head out. Don't assume your favourite loop on the Vedder River Rotary Trail is clear sailing, especially with all the work happening. Stick to designated trails, and maybe keep the earbuds out to hear any unexpected machinery or traffic changes.
