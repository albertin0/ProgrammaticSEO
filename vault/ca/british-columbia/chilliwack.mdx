Alright, Chilliwack, let's talk about hitting the pavement or the dirt today. It's one of those days where the sky looks inviting, but don't let that fool you; the ground beneath your feet might be a different story.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   Clear skies are a go, and the pollen count is finally playing nice for once. No excuses for sneezing through your tempo run.
*   That AQI is a little spicy for "clear," sitting in the moderate range due to ozone. You'll feel it if you push too hard.
*   Remember those winds from a couple of days ago? They've likely left some "surprises" on less-maintained paths. Keep your eyes peeled for debris.
*   Backcountry trails, especially around places like Chilliwack Lake Park, are still a mess from previous atmospheric rivers and winter conditions. Don't be a hero.
</BulletList>

## Breathe Easy (Mostly)

The good news? Your allergies can take a break. Pollen levels are blessedly low today. Your lungs, however, might still be working a bit harder than you'd like.

| Pollen Type | Level       |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| Overall     | Low         |

With an AQI of 68, driven by ozone, we're firmly in the "Moderate" zone. It's not "stay inside and bubble wrap yourself" bad, but it's enough to make you notice, especially if you're sensitive or planning a high-intensity session. Consider scaling back that all-out sprint or choosing a route away from heavy traffic areas where ozone can concentrate.

## Trail Warnings: Don't Be That Guy (or Gal)

You know how Chilliwack weather likes to throw curveballs. While today is clear and a cool 3.8°C, we're still dealing with the aftermath of past events, particularly on our Forest Service Roads (FSRs) and backcountry trails.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Chilliwack Lake Park and FSRs: Proceed with Extreme Caution (or don't).**
The Chilliwack Lake FSR, which is your main access to parts of Sx̱ótsaqel/Chilliwack Lake Park, remains closed due to unstable conditions and road washouts from the December storm event. Even if you're on foot, trail edges and stream banks within the park are prone to erosion and can fail without warning. This isn't just a "muddy boots" warning; it's a "you could get seriously hurt" warning. Check the Ministry of Forests road safety info before even thinking about heading back there. You've been warned.
</AlertBox>

Other FSRs in the Chilliwack Natural Resource District also have issues. American FSR 8123.01, for instance, is closed at multiple points due to rockfall and washouts, a closure that's been in effect since early February. There's also ongoing road maintenance, including drilling and blasting, on Spuzzum FSR until mid-March. These aren't your friendly neighbourhood jogging paths.

Closer to town, the Fraser Valley Regional District has the Kettle Valley Rail Trail listed as closed, with staff still assessing damage. Even the Great Blue Heron Nature Reserve, which generally has its trails open, still has its Tower Trail closed due to a dangerous tree and boardwalk repairs. The takeaway? Don't assume your usual route is clear just because the sun's out.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**Watch Your Step!**
Recent strong winds in the Fraser Canyon and surrounding areas, including gusts up to 50 km/h in Chilliwack just yesterday, can mean downed branches and other debris on trails and less-traveled roads. Even if the sun is shining, keep your eyes peeled for unexpected obstacles.

## General Life in Chilliwack

There's a Fraser Valley Women's Expo happening at Chilliwack Heritage Park until March 1, so expect some extra traffic around that area if you're passing by. Construction projects around the city, like the new long-term care facility on Mary Street or the A.D. Rundle Middle School expansion, are on the horizon for 2026, but aren't currently blocking common workout routes.

<AlertBox type="info">
**Layer Up & Stay Visible:**
With temperatures hovering around 3.8°C and clear skies, it's easy to underdress if you're not planning for the chill. Dress in layers you can shed, and since it's still winter, keep visibility in mind if you're out early or late.

So, yeah, get out there, but keep your head on a swivel. Your PT (me) thanks you.
