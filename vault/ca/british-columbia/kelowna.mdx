Today's a classic Kelowna shoulder-season kind of day: deceptively clear, but with enough local shenanigans and moderate air to keep you on your toes if you're actually planning to *move* outside.

<LungsJointsScore score={6} />

<BulletList>
*   The Air Quality Index is hanging in the moderate range, mostly due to ozone. If your lungs are finicky, tread lightly.
*   Downtown is a bit of a mess with the "Coldest Night of the Year" walk today, so avoid Coronation Ave and parts of the Waterfront Promenade.
*   Construction season is gearing up, with some permanent and new closures affecting popular routes and access points.
</BulletList>

### Air Quality & Allergies

Despite the clear skies, our air isn't quite pristine. The AQI is sitting at 71, which the provincial health authorities classify as "moderate." This means most folks are fine, but if you're sensitive to air pollution (hello, fellow asthmatics!), you might notice it during extended or strenuous outdoor activity. Interestingly, Environment Canada's Air Quality Health Index is forecasting a "low risk" of 2 for the Central Okanagan today, so take your pick on which metric you trust more for your personal risk assessment.

As for pollen, you're pretty much in the clear.

<AlertBox type="warning">
**AQI Advisory:** With an AQI of 71 and Ozone as the dominant pollutant, individuals with respiratory conditions should consider scaling back intense or prolonged workouts outside today. Listen to your body, not just the sunshine.
</AlertBox>

### Weather Woes (or lack thereof)

It's a crisp 3.6°C out there right now, feeling a bit cooler with a slight breeze. Clear skies mean you won't be battling rain or snow, which is a win for February, but don't forget those layers. The sun's out, but it's not exactly shorts weather for us mere mortals.

### Local Hazards & Annoyances

Alright, this is where it gets real.

<AlertBox type="danger">
**Downtown Event Gridlock:** If your usual route involves the downtown core, especially around the waterfront, change your plans. The "Coldest Night of the Year" fundraising walk is happening *today*, Saturday, February 28th. Coronation Avenue from St. Paul Street to Ellis Street is shut down from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. Worse yet, participants will be clogging up sections of the **Lakefront Promenade** between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. Expect serious pedestrian congestion. Go somewhere else, trust me.
</AlertBox>

<AlertBox type="info">
**Construction Season Preview:**
*   **Okanagan Rail Trail:** Always a popular choice, but remember there's still a roughly seven-kilometre section north of the Airport that's closed with no current reopening date. Check the trail website before you commit to a long haul.
*   **Burtch Road Extension:** Work on this contentious project, including new protected bike lanes and access to the **Munson Pond trail network**, is slated to *begin* in mid-March. While not immediate today, anticipate delays and reroutes in that area very soon.
*   **Doyle Avenue:** Construction for the South Art Walk project means single-lane alternating traffic and occasional closures on Doyle Avenue between the traffic circle and Ellis Street until April. Pedestrians, you'll want alternative routes here too.
*   **Stewart Road East Parking:** If you usually park at the Stewart Road East lot for park access, it's closed for construction until May 1, 2026. Plan alternative parking.
</AlertBox>

Finally, a bit of local charm for those heading up **Knox Mountain Park**. City crews recently put up a temporary sign warning of "uneven surfaces, exposed roots, and wild Sasquatch" on an unfinished trail (Lynn Ridge, due for completion by spring). So, you know, watch your step, respect the designated trails, keep Fido leashed, and maybe bring some jerky for Bigfoot.
